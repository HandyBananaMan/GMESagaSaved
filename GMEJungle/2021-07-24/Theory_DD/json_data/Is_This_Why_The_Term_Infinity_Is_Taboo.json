    "selftext": "I\u2019m pissed. Spent all day working on DD into Steve Cohen and just as I\u2019m wrapping it up the entire post just disappeared. No draft left or anything. Long story short, in the reigning MOASS (Volkswagen Infinity Squeeze), the saltiest heggie tears were shed. \n\n  \n\n\n[I wonder who\u2018s tears? And there\u2019s the \u201cI\u201d word...](https://preview.redd.it/vpvl9oc9dad71.jpg?width=972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=340873c43ca1d00d47c29654f09b346546b55824)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hmm interesting.. \\*clicks link](https://preview.redd.it/7f3gnntmdad71.jpg?width=2424&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47e2a5e29b4065ef4a64a1299348559bb87e5fca)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Go on Stevie.

You\u2019re about to have a new #1. Trading is tough don\u2019t ya think? Especially when you\u2019re a convicted criminal due for a karma visit making over leveraged bets with infinite loss potential.   \n\n\nTL;DR - The word \u201cinfinity\u201d as it relates to short squeezes is the stuff Steve Cohen\u2018s nightmares are made of. Maybe this is why it\u2019s such a controversial term?",
