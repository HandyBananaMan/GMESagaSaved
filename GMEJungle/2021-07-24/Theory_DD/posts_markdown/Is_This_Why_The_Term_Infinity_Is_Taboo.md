I’m pissed. Spent all day working on DD into Steve Cohen and just as I’m wrapping it up the entire post just disappeared. No draft left or anything. Long story short, in the reigning MOASS (Volkswagen Infinity Squeeze), the saltiest heggie tears were shed.

Hold RC’s beer Stevie. You’re about to have a new #1. Trading is tough don’t ya think? Especially when you’re a convicted criminal due for a karma visit making over leveraged bets with infinite loss potential.   


TL;DR - The word “infinity” as it relates to short squeezes is the stuff Steve Cohen‘s nightmares are made of. Maybe this is why it’s such a controversial term?
