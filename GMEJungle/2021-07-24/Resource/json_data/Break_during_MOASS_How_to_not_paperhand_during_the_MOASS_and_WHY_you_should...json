Feel free to provide suggestions.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi all. I *feel* it coming. How about you? No, no dates or anything, but I think it's about time to start focusing on our (as in individual investors making individually sound financial decisions) action, or rather, inaction, during the **MOASS**. Seeing as this is truly the lynchpin of this powder keg I find it extremely *SUS* we aren't talking about it more.\n\nI'm far too smooth-brained to be responsible for a well-thought out thread that can be utilized by thousands of apes during a time of need in order to literally better their lives and the world, but I'm *just* smooth-brained enough to maybe be the spark that is. ***This is my goal.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ All credit to u\\/t4t0626 ](https://reddit.com/link/oqxzef/video/xhbb1d96ced71/player)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I think the thread should be stickied for visibility and should** ***at least*** **include the following:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ***INFINITY POOL***\n\n[Mathematical Proof for Infinity Squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/oqmy7f/smooth_crayon_version_explanation_of_the/)\n\n[MOASS Visualized](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nsv3mz/moass_visualized_distributions_game_theory/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[Infinity Pool/Infinite Money Glitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9ifjx/infinity_pool_how_gme_will_break_the_laws_of/)\n\n[Simplified explanation](https://i.redd.it/lgppag6u7s771.jpg)\n\n[Listen to Yoda you bitch](https://i.redd.it/labq6f8bz8971.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Information related to calculations of % of float shorted**\n\n[Short Interest Calculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvshu8/short_interest_calculation_based_on_share/)\n\n[Mo' calcalations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ohqka0/using_maths_and_the_to_estimate_the_real_si_and/)\n\n[Wow, such NUMBERS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ol4gv0/short_shorter_ep_3_post_sneeze_and_final_shares/)\n\n[Okay, you get the point](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m19oh7/true_short_interest_could_be_anywhere_from_250_to/)\n\n[Survey Stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omdafo/final_update_of_google_consumer_survey_n2200_at/)\n\n[A.I.

I do feel it's important to have something like this at the ready. The DD is done. The end is assured. It's all about how apes react during the MOASS. Assuming reddit stays up something like this can make all the difference.\n\n**Somehow incorporating funny diamond-hand memes for emotional support during the MOASS could also be beneficial.**\n\n**Additionally, do we have a backup plan for this sub, yet? In my estimation SS is still compromised (they're just laying low until the time is right). Where to \"meet-up\" if reddit or this sub goes down is something that should be prioritized IMO.**\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n[**u/pinkcatsonacid**](https://www.reddit.com/user/pinkcatsonacid/)\n\n[**u/BodySurfDan**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BodySurfDan/)\n\n***I'll leave you with some words from a simple ape (me):***\n\nPeople really need to think about real wealth and real change. Do you want the past year to be all for not and make a hundred thousand dollars after taxes? Come on man, really? You're gonna continue to work the rest of your life and honestly hate yourself.\n\nIf you panic sell your Gamestop shares are gone and you are no longer a player. Regardless of what happens, fuckery or not, you are NO LONGER in the conversation. ***Let that sink in.***\n\nIf you don't sell as many shares as high as you want, guess what? You have a cushion, called GS stock. This stock isn't ever coming back down due to the IP (it'll come down just nowhere near where we're at now), so regardless you are going to have good money.\n\n**Worst case scenario if you somehow are afraid you'll hold \"too long\" and \"miss the squeeze\" is you'll still have GME stock which will still be incredibly valuable and importantly you still have skin in the game. You have a legal right to the shares and if any shenanigans occur, and I truly don't think they will, you still have room to talk and are invested in an emerging technology company with amazing leaders.**\n\n**Worst case scenario if you paperhand is you sell for 20,000 dollars while you watch everyone else sell for 35 million and you GIVE UP ANY RIGHT TO SPEAK if any shenanigans occur. You essentially sell early because you're afraid of a hypothetical situation that won't occur and if it does certainly won't in the manner you think.**\n\n*Shareholders are legally entitled to this short squeeze. The onus is on* ***\"them\"*** *to ensure we are fairly paid. The onus isn't on us to pussy out because of some made-up, hypothetical, likely of shill origin scenario.*\n\n**This is a once ever event. If you fuck up we all go back to how we were before. Think about that.**\n\n*Babidi is the FUD. You're Vegeta. Killing the supreme Kai is paperhanding. Goku is the MOASS. Oh, btw, if someone makes a meme of this clip I'd love it. Get hype! (Sorry, had to*).\n\n[(1) Vegeta's Pride (1080p H\u00d0) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7IvsW9xHnU&ab_channel=UncutHDDragonBallZGT)\n\nIt's basic risk/reward. The choice is clear.\n\nRemember. The world without SHFs. This is truly bigger than just making money. This could be a pivotal point in history. At the very least it's us saying we refuse to take it lying down:\n\n[Do not go gentle into that good night.
