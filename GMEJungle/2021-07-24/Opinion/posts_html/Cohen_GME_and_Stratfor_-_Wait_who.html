<p>Edit 1 - After doing some more reading and looking through the comments, it looks like that this may not be as big of a deal as I originally thought. Thanks to everyone who responded so this could get sorted out (also exactly why I love that topics get sorted out via Reddit). I've included some of the responses below:</p>
<p>As u/kamoob666 points out, <em>"Ok so I looked at the F13 filings for Point 72. They ticked a box in the file for "13F combination report". The "combination" is with Cubist Systemic Strategies. This is the former Quant arm of SAC."</em> <strong>Looks like this may be similar to Stratfor, so worth the dig.</strong></p>
<p>As u/LunarPayload mentioned, <em>"$40,000 a year is very cheap for a company-wide membership</em>." <strong>Good point. I'm still used to thinking in terms of what is expensive to the average person.</strong></p>
<p>And finally, as u/therileyfactor7 mentioned, <em>"So as someone who has been receiving StratFor reports and reading their intelligence gathering for nearly 20 years, you are off the mark OP. I don’t want this to sound as FUD, and I’m sure Stevie-Boy uses their services, but StratFor doesn’t have an active manipulation/espionage arm. What they do have is vast resources to gather intelligence from around the globe and put that news into an intelligible report, which results in them putting out world events before any of the MSM says a word about them, which would certainly give someone like Stevie another advantage. As an example (this is from memory, I could dig back in my email to find the exact report if necessary) StratFor projected the rise of ISIS in the Middle East in about 2004 or 2005, years before anyone else was talking about it.</em>" <strong>Good to know. Now that you mention it, the March 2021 podcast that referenced short sellers trying to manipulate the stock really did stand out, because many of the common MSM outlets were all pinning this (and still are) on retail / drawing the attention away from SHF.</strong></p>
<p>I'll leave the post up so apes can see my original thoughts and then the responses. Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>How do you do, fellow apes? First post! Woot!</p>
<p>As always, don't just trust what I say. Don't just trust me. I'm just an anonymous lurker watching the world from my quiet pumpkin patch... er... garden. If anything is wrong, please let me know in the comments, and I'll update it accordingly. I welcome any and all feedback. Also, I flaired this as "Opinion" as I couldn't find a "Discussion" flair.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The more apes dig into Steve Cohen, more distractions occur. How? Cohen / Point72 may be utilizing Stratfor Enterprises LLC ('Stratfor'), a geopolitical intelligence gathering organization that prides itself on global risk assessment for high-level clients and companies, to fight back.</p>

<p>So who / what is Stratfor? Well, per their website:</p>
<p><em>"As the world's leading geopolitical intelligence platform, Stratfor brings global events into valuable perspective, empowering businesses, governments and individuals to more confidently navigate their way through an increasingly complex international environment.</em></p>
<p><em>Stratfor develops comprehensive, independent, and unbiased analyses by examining global events through the lens of geopolitics and our proprietary methodology ..."</em></p>

<p>Now, imagine you are the head of an investment firm who was heavily involved in the illegal naked shorting of GameStop. The company has, so far, been able to fly relatively under the radar as there's a pretty good scapegoat. You know that gamers are exceptionally stubborn individuals who will literally spend weeks, months, even years trying to beat a game. Not only that, they absolutely thrive in an environment where the entire game is rigged against them. So how do you continue to stay under the radar and avoid the scrutiny of the self-proclaimed "apes" who have no problem eating ramen and wearing underwear riddled with holes (and who place bananas up their booty)?</p>
<p>I'd speculate you'd use something like this:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>What better way than to keep tabs on Reddit, social media, news outlets, etc. than to literally utilize a program that filters out everything else? Oh, your name / company was mentioned on a post? <em>*ding*</em> "You have another notification. Please review."</p>
<p>And this service ain't cheap:</p>

<p>So how do I know they're staying on top of GameStop and Reddit?</p>

<p>This was posted back on March 17, 2021. So far, this is the only public post / link I can find. This tells me then this company definitely has been staying on top of the GME saga. Given the amount of money involved, they absolutely would try to stay on top of this.</p>

<p>I've noticed that whenever Cohen / P72 are mentioned in posts, comments, etc., there seems to be an eventual influx of distractions and other "hot topics". With the internet age, things move FAST. Really fast. So having a high-end service that can stay on top of it is crucial. To me, that's why it seems like many of the posts don't receive a whole lot of "attention" for long. Analysts are able to find other "intriguing" things to get apes hyping up and throw poo, which then allows for the "concerning" post to slowly disappear into Page 2 and 3.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Ok, this is all fine and dandy, but ~~wow~~ how the thrip does this possibly relate to Cohen? Where's your evidence?"</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: the following part is to be especially taken with a grain of salt (which should go without saying for anything you read).</em></p>
<p>Enter WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/s53qgu4az6d71.jpg?width=950&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e284b9ac363de203f3e8d2d5a45a76ed0db31de</p>
<p>On November 15, 2013, WikiLeaks released an e-mail thread between Cohen and Stratfor. For legal purposes, I won't copy and paste the e-mail threads into this post. For those looking for anything of actual substance in the e-mails, I couldn't find any "damning" evidence. Just a, "Hey, I want to talk."</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/28/289538_re-call-with-steve-cohen-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/28/289538_re-call-with-steve-cohen-.html</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Does this conclusively confirm that Cohen is using Stratfor? <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Does it at least establish a connection between Cohen and the previous chairman of Stratfor, George Friedman? <strong>Yes.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, I will say though that one of the e-mail addresses included in the thread appears to be for a 'Ron Insana'. Who?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.roninsana.com/">http://www.roninsana.com/</a></p>
<p>Has Ron ever commented on GameStop? Yup!</p>

<p>Finally, I value counter-opinions, so here's a news article from 2012 that rebuts Stratfor:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's enough for today. Time to go back to my garden and deal with some of these gnarly bugs.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
