Don't need more confirmation bias. My tits are already a bloody mess. We know how the SHFs and MMs are hiding their nudes.\n\nThe shills will keep shilling. The DD gods will continue to bless. The SHFs will keep tub girling until they drown. Those continuing to wake up new apes will be rewarded in Valhalla.\n\nOnce the price hits $1k I will tune back in. Otherwise I will HODL until I die. Once the price hits $1k it's on, the SHFs have lost control and we begin to fight big banks and governing bodies head on. I'll grab my popcorn, strap in and ride into the millions with blood diamond hands. Until then, I will sleep with my XXXX without a single fuck to give until I die.\n\n$GME forever... Signing off for now...\n\n- Hodelle Beckham Jr.",
