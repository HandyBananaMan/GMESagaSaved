Making this post as I have been seeing a lot of posts or comments on SS and some here about low price anchoring in the single digit millions (which is chump change btw) people have also been commenting en masse on some posts that the 30million plus floor is impossible based on market cap being more money than what supposedly exists in the world.

This is wrong for so many reasons and here’s why

1: Market cap is only an on paper representation of value in the MOASS situation it is not a reliable indication of anything.

2: I could say to anyone who doubts the floor to simply read the DD but there is a far more simple confirmation that the floor is likely on the Investopedia website which states that short selling can incur “INFINITE LOSSES” this is a simple undeniable fact about the nature of shorting and whats more is that the definition was written with the idea of normal shorting in mind instead of the huge naked short-selling that GME is experiencing which creates potentially hundreds of millions more shares than there should exist for the ticker. Those are hundreds of millions of potential infinite losses for the corrupt financial system the only limit to that loss is your floor.

Tldr:30 million is easily possible corrupt system is very fuk
