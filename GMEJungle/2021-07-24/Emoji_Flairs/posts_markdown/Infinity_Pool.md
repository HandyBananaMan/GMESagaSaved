These are the two words they fear most. Well, maybe margin call are? I don't know. Point is, ~~automod is still blocking them over at Superstonk and~~ there is a bot campaign across all GME subs to lower its' visibility.

For those that aren't aware, the concept is simple. It's the idea that as investors we individually come to the conclusion that we would like to hold onto our shares forever (for a variety of good and fundamentally/financially sound reasons). Based on previous DD we can deduce that if such a thing were to happen as a result of our independently making this sound decision a pool of untouchable shares will essentially be created that is likely higher than the available float. This will likely result in a share price that has never been conceived of.

I for one will be holding onto at least 50 percent of my shares forever, probably more, because can't stop won't stop. GAMESTOP.

Honestly, just testing the post on this sub. Want to see its' bot/shill reception. To infinity and beyond, boys.
