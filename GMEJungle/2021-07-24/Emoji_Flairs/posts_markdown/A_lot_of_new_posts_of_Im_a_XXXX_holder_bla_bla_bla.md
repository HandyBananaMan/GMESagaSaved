Smells like some FUD just like last time the feed was littered with ‘XXX’ and ‘XXXX’ holders making posts. 

Just like before, the consensus was that these accounts will try to get people to sell early when they make future posts during the MOASS. 

The FUD seed has been planted.

Since when was posting ‘x’ ‘xx’ ‘xxx’ positions acceptable again? We are all apes, and we are different than the current class war.

I don’t care if you only have a fraction of a share! ALL APES ARE CREATED EQUAL REGARDLESS OF THEIR POSITION.

Number of shares doesn’t matter when the price reaches 30-50 million +
