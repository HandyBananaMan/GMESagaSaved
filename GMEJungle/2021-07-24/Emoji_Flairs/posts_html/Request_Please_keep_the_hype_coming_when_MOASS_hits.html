<p>I was raised to always play it safe. None of my family have ever been risk-takers. But GME is where I've decided to go all in. This is my big bet and I'm going to see it through to the moon (and beyond).</p>
<p>But this is where I need your help. I was playing the MOASS simulator (sirlondon.com - I don't know how safe this site is, I don't remember who made it. Visit at your own risk), and the big numbers looked good. A little too good, and I "sold" earlier than I wanted a couple times during the game.</p>
<p>I'll need all the reassurance I can get mid-MOASS, and I doubt I'm the only one. We need to keep up the hype and the encouragement after we hit the first batch of large (to us) numbers. My floor is astronomical, but I'll need your help to get there. </p>
<p>I'll see you all on the moon, but we'll need each other on the way, too.</p>
<p>(Please excuse the low karma account. I created a brand new one so that I can remain anonymous during all this)</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the awards! Also, these responses are already helping. I can't wait! (You know, unless I have to, in which case I'll wait as long as it takes for the hedgies to go under)</p>
