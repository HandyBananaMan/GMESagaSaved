<p>Smells like some FUD just like last time the feed was littered with ‘XXX’ and ‘XXXX’ holders making posts. </p>
<p>Just like before, the consensus was that these accounts will try to get people to sell early when they make future posts during the MOASS. </p>
<p>The FUD seed has been planted.</p>
<p>Since when was posting ‘x’ ‘xx’ ‘xxx’ positions acceptable again? We are all apes, and we are different than the current class war.</p>
<p>I don’t care if you only have a fraction of a share! ALL APES ARE CREATED EQUAL REGARDLESS OF THEIR POSITION.</p>
<p>Number of shares doesn’t matter when the price reaches 30-50 million +</p>
<p>💎🙌
