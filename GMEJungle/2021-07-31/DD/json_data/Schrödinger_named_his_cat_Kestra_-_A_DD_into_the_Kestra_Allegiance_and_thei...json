This post will raise more questions than it answers.**\n\nOh, and a quick note about the **Schr\u00f6dinger** reference. I'm referring to the question: \"have we found a massive crime syndicate with $10.5 trillion betting against GME or haven't we?\" I don't know yet.\n\nIt's the general philosophical arch of this whole investigation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Genesis Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/otvabt/kestra_advisory_services_llc/)\n\nSummary: Kestra Advisory Services have an 8 trillion dollar portfolio according to Fintel and 4 13F files that popped up in the last 12 months - with the first 13F being filed November 2020. Kestra Advisory Services are the No.1 holder of Blackrock Fund: [IWM Institutional Ownership - iShares Russell 2000 ETF](https://fintel.io/so/us/iwm). This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYd9brSVoFI) will help you understand why this is important to our narrative. Upon Investigation I discovered that Kestra Advisory Services is actually part of a much larger group, the Kestra Allegiance. After examining the Kestra Allegiance in more depth I found Kestra Private Wealth Services and another 3 13F files, again all submitted since November 2020. This brings the total portfolio value of Kestra to $10.5 trillion. Kestra also have a thick history of corruption and fraud according to numerous SEC changes. - Please see original post for all the links.\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/ouhyzq/schr%C3%B6dinger_named_his_cat_kestra_a_dd_into_the/?sort=new)\n\nSummary: The main argument against Kestra having a $10.5 Trillion portfolio all of a sudden is that it must be a mistake. In this post I examine exactly how such a mistake could have been made. I also highlight the fact that these mistakes have not been amended and they also seem to align with some pretty weird things that Kestra were doing around November 2020. I also dig thorough Kestra's history and find a direct connection to  [NFP Holdings, LLC](https://sec.report/CIK/0001580989) a financial firm that has been ordering large quantities of 3-HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID SODIUM from several Chinese Biotech companies - all in the last 12 months. - Please see original post for all the links.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, now that you are all up to date, [let's begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9geXVAOFDg).\n\n# 1. Kestra and Blackrock\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is definitely a connection. Just look at all the Blackrock Funds that Kestra pops up in:\n\n[BLACKROCK LARGE CAP SERIES FUNDS, INC.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-large-cap-series-funds-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-331)[BLACKROCK MUNICIPAL SERIES TRUST](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-municipal-series-trust-497-2021-april-26-18743-902)[BLACKROCK EQUITY DIVIDEND FUND](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-equity-dividend-fund-497-2021-april-26-18743-806)[BLACKROCK EUROFUND](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-eurofund-497-2021-april-26-18743-713)[BLACKROCK MID CAP DIVIDEND SERIES, INC.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-mid-cap-dividend-series-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-346)[BLACKROCK MULTI STATE MUNICIPAL SERIES TRUST](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-multi-state-municipal-series-trust-497-2021-april-26-18743-73)[BLACKROCK MUNICIPAL BOND FUND, INC.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-municipal-bond-fund-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-53)[BLACKROCK BASIC VALUE FUND, INC.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-basic-value-fund-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-219)[BLACKROCK LARGE CAP FOCUS GROWTH FUND, INC.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-large-cap-focus-growth-fund-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-594)[BLACKROCK ALLOCATION TARGET SHARES - 497](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-allocation-target-shares-497-2021-april-26-18743-999)[BlackRock Advantage SMID Cap Fund, Inc.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-advantage-smid-cap-fund-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-656)[BlackRock Long-Horizon Equity Fund](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-long-horizon-equity-fund-497-2021-april-26-18743-964)[BLACKROCK GLOBAL ALLOCATION FUND, INC.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-global-allocation-fund-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-691)[BLACKROCK CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL SERIES TRUST](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-california-municipal-series-trust-497-2021-april-26-18743-125)[BLACKROCK FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SERIES TRUST](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-financial-institutions-series-trust-497-2021-april-26-18743-225)[BLACKROCK EMERGING MARKETS FUND, INC.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-blackrock-emerging-markets-fund-inc-497-2021-april-26-18743-44)\n\nNow, a search for 'Kestra Blackrock' brings up some interesting articles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ti0fyqq80je71.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=af18b92335ad1127c5ce38ba47c40180ac3ee831\n\nIf you click on the last 3 articles however they don't exist. They all redirect to [this link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/HYT/?utm_source=404Redirect&utm_medium=404Redirect) .

Kestra and Fraud\n\nNow in post 1 I found [this](https://www.sec.gov/enforce/ia-5770-s)\n\nDig into it a bit more and we get this:\n\n\u201cThe SEC's orders find that the Kestra Advisers violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.\u201d\n\nDig into that a bit more and we find this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ix3qnts2je71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff9fcffb75411b994193c518ef78a4fb30b688fb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now we have confirmation that on **July 9 2021** Kestra was done for a) engaging in fraud and b) manipulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks u/tld0550 for helping me with this bit.\n\nNow with this in mind the [13F form that they submitted a few days ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830819/000183081921000003/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml) looks kinda sus. All of a sudden this *$8.8 Trillion* doesn't seem like such an innocent mistake.\n\nIf you dig through my other posts you can see that Kestra has a long history of being shifty. The main questions that I want to answer now are:\n\n**\"What has Kestra been doing in the last 6 months?\"**\n\n**\"Where did all of this money come from?\"**\n\n# 3. Recent Kestra Hire\n\nSo, [late 2020 Kestra begins to submit 13F files](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/dateRange=custom&category=form-cat1&entityName=kestra&startdt=2001-01-01&enddt=2021-07-28) in the trillions of $ out of nowhere. At the same time they go through a [massive hire](https://www.kestrafinancial.com/newsroom/news-releases/kestra-financial-closes-out-2020).\n\nIf we look into the 'Wealth Management Institutions' that these people came from they all have a similar disclaimer at the bottom of their websites:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwx4omv5dje71.png?width=2286&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba3ca6d63e69ced374104759cb58db651d348e77\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvfd4nv5dje71.png?width=1414&format=png&auto=webp&s=803074236f74f428e3e280416c2264d1a9aeea76\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9lfnmv5dje71.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&s=415936fe45cad500606049f6d6d093afcb7dd9b6\n\nAll of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I propose that this is the beginning of the** >!Kestra Hive Mind!< **and this is something I plan to revisit.**\n\nBTW, similar institutions with a similar disclaimer can be found giving lots of 'financial advice' right before November 2020 - **more detail on this in Post 1**, but you can also just look for yourself by doing a search for \"Kestra Advisory Services -month- 2020\" and go from there.\n\n**Update:** Kestra have a mutation problem and I think I just caught it. If we look at [this release](https://www.kestrafinancial.com/newsroom/news-releases/two-kestra-private-wealth-services-affiliated-firms-merge) from Kestra we can see that they combined Kestra Private wealth Services and PSM Private Wealth Management to form 'California Wealth Transitions' **August 2020.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i22fb4dlzke71.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3be5a0585900ff8197cef17fbe63eaff9240398\n\nIf we dig into [California Wealth Transitions](https://cawealth.com/keith-brandt/) we find the same disclaimer:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64u119mvzke71.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=812e377c952366b43068d420de1ba66ee7e0edd4\n\nIt is possible that Kestra has mutated in this way hundreds (if not thousands) of times. How big is this hive mind?\n\n# 4. Kestra and Fidelity\n\n[Looks like Kestra has a new President](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/07/21/kestra-taps-stephen-langlois-as-president/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ip14m7stzie71.png?width=2550&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce8fcd4cdfa149013e18df3263265be16a1c3a81\n\n[Check out where he used to work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenrlanglois)\n\nThis could be nothing, but never the less it is interesting.\n\n**Note- I didn't include this to cause panic, it's most probably nothing.

Kestra Financial (this is the actual name for the Kestra Allegiance) is purchased by Warburg Pincus in **Feburary 2019**, fast forward almost 2 years and they explode out of nowhere with a [13F for 5.3 Trillion](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830819/000183081920000001/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml).\n\nAlso, [looks like Warburg Pincus have recently been trying to purchase large storage facilities.](https://www.mingtiandi.com/real-estate/finance-real-estate/warburg-pincus-bidding-against-gaw-for-a1-73b-aussie-self-storage-reit/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f0e20vyuje71.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a4a42dfb359d10ef726bda81ef01704cf9bdb4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[They also seem to be purchasing a lot of Chinese realestate](https://www.reuters.com/business/warburg-pincus-steps-up-investment-chinas-urban-renewal-projects-2021-06-30/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qap68pqo6ke71.png?width=2006&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a9c935afba293f34507e078c95313b463d9f635\n\n[And buying things from Blackstone](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2021/06/28/exeter-bought-by-warburg-pincus.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wbyyxr77ke71.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9eaaed77f84cdc22b0949d7ae9ee25b2078a39c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, look at [this](https://warburgpincus.com/investments/newease-china/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53xyupr5hke71.png?width=3514&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa403a79f05b19a71fe90582317f50ba18a8835f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollowed by [this](https://www.mingtiandi.com/real-estate/logistics/goldman-sachs-new-ease-set-up-china-logistics-jv/):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xx4jch7dhke71.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=0607130146f587455100170ff50d327feac87280\n\nA search for Warburg Pincus on Mingtandi will reveal their [various Chinese realestate endeavours](https://www.mingtiandi.com/?s=WARBURG+PINCUS) and it's safe to say that these guys have been going pretty hard for the last 4 or 5 years.\n\nNow, what is the connection between large Chinese biotech orders, Chinese realestate and an interest in large scale storage facilities?
