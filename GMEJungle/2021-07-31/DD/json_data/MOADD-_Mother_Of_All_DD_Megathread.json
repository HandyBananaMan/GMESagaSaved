I already have a PDF master list of every DD from Superstonk that I am sifting through but it will take a while to compile it all in a useful format. So for now, let's make sure visitors see lots of good DD when they first visit the Jungle!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're new here and looking for serious research DD, be sure to visit r/DDintoGME, r/GME, as well as the many other GME subs on reddit. As always, stay vigilant with everything you read, and never stop questioning everything!
