<p><strong>Disclaimer: This is a big work in progress. The more I dig the thicker the web becomes. This post will raise more questions than it answers.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, and a quick note about the <strong>Schrödinger</strong> reference. I'm referring to the question: "have we found a massive crime syndicate with $10.5 trillion betting against GME or haven't we?" I don't know yet.</p>
<p>It's the general philosophical arch of this whole investigation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/otvabt/kestra_advisory_services_llc/">Genesis Post</a></p>
<p>Summary: Kestra Advisory Services have an 8 trillion dollar portfolio according to Fintel and 4 13F files that popped up in the last 12 months - with the first 13F being filed November 2020. Kestra Advisory Services are the No.1 holder of Blackrock Fund: <a href="https://fintel.io/so/us/iwm">IWM Institutional Ownership - iShares Russell 2000 ETF</a>. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYd9brSVoFI">video</a> will help you understand why this is important to our narrative. Upon Investigation I discovered that Kestra Advisory Services is actually part of a much larger group, the Kestra Allegiance. After examining the Kestra Allegiance in more depth I found Kestra Private Wealth Services and another 3 13F files, again all submitted since November 2020. This brings the total portfolio value of Kestra to $10.5 trillion. Kestra also have a thick history of corruption and fraud according to numerous SEC changes. - Please see original post for all the links.</p>

<p>Summary: The main argument against Kestra having a $10.5 Trillion portfolio all of a sudden is that it must be a mistake. In this post I examine exactly how such a mistake could have been made. I also highlight the fact that these mistakes have not been amended and they also seem to align with some pretty weird things that Kestra were doing around November 2020. I also dig thorough Kestra's history and find a direct connection to  <a href="https://sec.report/CIK/0001580989">NFP Holdings, LLC</a> a financial firm that has been ordering large quantities of 3-HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID SODIUM from several Chinese Biotech companies - all in the last 12 months. - Please see original post for all the links.</p>

<p>Okay, now that you are all up to date, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9geXVAOFDg">let's begin</a>.</p>
<h1>1. Kestra and Blackrock</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is definitely a connection. Just look at all the Blackrock Funds that Kestra pops up in:</p>

<p>Now, a search for 'Kestra Blackrock' brings up some interesting articles.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>If you click on the last 3 articles however they don't exist. They all redirect to <a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/HYT/?utm_source=404Redirect&amp;utm_medium=404Redirect">this link</a> . Is someone trying to coverup a Kestra/Blackrock connection?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Merlyn and a BTC Blackrock ETF huh?" src="https://preview.redd.it/1y0yz1t01je71.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5ef49b030daf39ab208c7c59a96e34ef0ce4208" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>2. Kestra and Fraud</h1>
<p>Now in post 1 I found <a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforce/ia-5770-s">this</a></p>
<p>Dig into it a bit more and we get this:</p>
<p>“The SEC's orders find that the Kestra Advisers violated Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.”</p>
<p>Dig into that a bit more and we find this:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/4ix3qnts2je71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9fcffb75411b994193c518ef78a4fb30b688fb</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So now we have confirmation that on <strong>July 9 2021</strong> Kestra was done for a) engaging in fraud and b) manipulation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thanks u/tld0550 for helping me with this bit.</p>
<p>Now with this in mind the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830819/000183081921000003/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml">13F form that they submitted a few days ago</a> looks kinda sus. All of a sudden this <em>$8.8 Trillion</em> doesn't seem like such an innocent mistake.</p>
<p>If you dig through my other posts you can see that Kestra has a long history of being shifty. The main questions that I want to answer now are:</p>
<p><strong>"What has Kestra been doing in the last 6 months?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Where did all of this money come from?"</strong></p>
<h1>3. Recent Kestra Hire</h1>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/dateRange=custom&amp;category=form-cat1&amp;entityName=kestra&amp;startdt=2001-01-01&amp;enddt=2021-07-28">late 2020 Kestra begins to submit 13F files</a> in the trillions of $ out of nowhere. At the same time they go through a <a href="https://www.kestrafinancial.com/newsroom/news-releases/kestra-financial-closes-out-2020">massive hire</a>.</p>
<p>If we look into the 'Wealth Management Institutions' that these people came from they all have a similar disclaimer at the bottom of their websites:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/vwx4omv5dje71.png?width=2286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3ca6d63e69ced374104759cb58db651d348e77</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/nvfd4nv5dje71.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803074236f74f428e3e280416c2264d1a9aeea76</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/k9lfnmv5dje71.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=415936fe45cad500606049f6d6d093afcb7dd9b6</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>I propose that this is the beginning of the</strong> &gt;!Kestra Hive Mind!&lt; <strong>and this is something I plan to revisit.</strong></p>
<p>BTW, similar institutions with a similar disclaimer can be found giving lots of 'financial advice' right before November 2020 - <strong>more detail on this in Post 1</strong>, but you can also just look for yourself by doing a search for "Kestra Advisory Services -month- 2020" and go from there.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Kestra have a mutation problem and I think I just caught it. If we look at <a href="https://www.kestrafinancial.com/newsroom/news-releases/two-kestra-private-wealth-services-affiliated-firms-merge">this release</a> from Kestra we can see that they combined Kestra Private wealth Services and PSM Private Wealth Management to form 'California Wealth Transitions' <strong>August 2020.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/i22fb4dlzke71.png?width=1334&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3be5a0585900ff8197cef17fbe63eaff9240398</p>
<p>If we dig into <a href="https://cawealth.com/keith-brandt/">California Wealth Transitions</a> we find the same disclaimer:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/64u119mvzke71.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=812e377c952366b43068d420de1ba66ee7e0edd4</p>
<p>It is possible that Kestra has mutated in this way hundreds (if not thousands) of times. How big is this hive mind?</p>

<p>This could be nothing, but never the less it is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Note- I didn't include this to cause panic, it's most probably nothing. There's a discussion going on in the comments about this point if you want some more info.</strong></p>
<h1>5. Warburg Pincus</h1>
<p>u/bowfdeez found <a href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/02/25/what-kestras-warburg-pincus-deal-means-for-its-future/">this interesting article</a>.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The timing here is just too good to ignore. Kestra Financial (this is the actual name for the Kestra Allegiance) is purchased by Warburg Pincus in <strong>Feburary 2019</strong>, fast forward almost 2 years and they explode out of nowhere with a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830819/000183081920000001/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml">13F for 5.3 Trillion</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.mingtiandi.com/real-estate/finance-real-estate/warburg-pincus-bidding-against-gaw-for-a1-73b-aussie-self-storage-reit/">looks like Warburg Pincus have recently been trying to purchase large storage facilities.</a></p>

<p>A search for Warburg Pincus on Mingtandi will reveal their <a href="https://www.mingtiandi.com/?s=WARBURG+PINCUS">various Chinese realestate endeavours</a> and it's safe to say that these guys have been going pretty hard for the last 4 or 5 years.</p>
<p>Now, what is the connection between large Chinese biotech orders, Chinese realestate and an interest in large scale storage facilities? With an 'accidental' $10.5 trillion that just popped up out of nowhere <strong>November 2020?</strong></p>
<p>This is full tinfoil hat shit, but I'm having the time of my life.</p>
