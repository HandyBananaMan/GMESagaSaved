<h1>🦍 Welcome to the Jungle 🌴</h1>
<p><em>This is a continuation of the</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/onehre/godtier_dd_megathread/">DD compilation project.</a>👩‍🔬🔬</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Please drop links to essential DD below.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, please do not drop any third party links, only links from around reddit. I already have a PDF master list of every DD from Superstonk that I am sifting through but it will take a while to compile it all in a useful format. So for now, let's make sure visitors see lots of good DD when they first visit the Jungle!!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you're new here and looking for serious research DD, be sure to visit r/DDintoGME, r/GME, as well as the many other GME subs on reddit. As always, stay vigilant with everything you read, and never stop questioning everything! Cheers! 🍻💎🙌🚀</p>
