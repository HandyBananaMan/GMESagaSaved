<p>So you might have heard that RC might be trying to send us the message "741". Then, on the 29th, when many apes expected him to confirm this or drop another hint, he tweeted a picture of him wearing googly eyes.</p>
<p>So, many took this as a call to "google" something. It seems to me, though, (and I have looked for this) that this dismisses the eyes, and therefore the task at hand is to google "eyes". So I did.</p>
<p>Searching the web for "eyes 741" led me to DND nail polish #741 with the name "Diamond Eyes".</p>
<p>And what happens when you apply that stuff? You get ~~💎💅~~, err, Diamond Hands. 💎🙌</p>
