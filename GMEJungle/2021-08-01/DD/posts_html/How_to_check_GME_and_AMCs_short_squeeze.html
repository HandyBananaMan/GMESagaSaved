<p>I am a Korean stock investor.</p>
<p>I love gme jungle.   ü¶ßü¶çüêúüíéüôåüíéüöÄüöÄüåïüåë</p>

<p>Using the accumulated difference between trading volume and trading valueLet's see if the current stock is short squeezing</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/a5na7rqdqse71.jpg?width=452&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b6ed403dc108beb2ad7924ca09335b9a5cc1201</p>
<p>First if we pull out a chart with GME‚Äôs closing price, volume, and trading value</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/75ouxyi9qse71.png?width=1475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d2566e2c4e03597d9d7d4185d6b59c44c4cf66</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>You can get these graphs.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs important here is that the amount of volume and trading value pulled out from security firm HTS are volumes and trading value which is calculated by average share prices. The closing price is the price provided due to the time limit.</p>
<p>The closed price due to time is fixed.The changeable figure is the average share price.If you compare this average share price to the fixed closing price,It will be possible to compare the numbers by dividing them into positive and negative numbers.And if you accumulate those numbers, there will be a pattern of accumulation when the stock price rises and falls in one direction.In that cumulative pattern, you can conclude that there is this pattern when the stock price goes in any direction.</p>
<p>Then let‚Äôs do some simple math.</p>
<p>Average share price*volume = trading value. However, the figures provided are the amount of volume, trading value calculated by trading at the closing price and average share price.If you divide the volume from the trading value the average stock price traded at the daily wage will come out.</p>
<p>I'll call it the divided closing price for convenience.</p>

<p>If you look at the divided close price it looks similar with the provided close price, but you can see there is a bit of difference</p>
<p>Parts that look very different</p>
<p>Feb 24TH  Feb 25TH May 5TH</p>
<p>Divided close prices are much higher</p>
<p>This also means that the average share price was traded more or there was a different route of transactions than the provided close price.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/ovo0c6j9qse71.png?width=1817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b29da3127aa0af6ddff319efdf7c8d53572c702</p>
<p>You can't simply say that the price has increased or decreased, so it has changed like this. The types and figures of transactions of average shares traded internally were different with the closed prices due to time.</p>
<p>In general, it was quite different from the average value that had been flowing.</p>
<p>It is impossible to specify what this is.It will be hard to know that. But I knew there was a difference.</p>
<p>Divide the trading value by the closed prices due to time. I'll say it's the divided volume for convenience.</p>
<p>I'll multiply the closed price due to time with the trading volume. For convenience I‚Äôll say it as multiplied trading value.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/3xj9shj9qse71.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb56fc43d738fdb7c198220770d36e6eeb806e55</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/bll8mri9qse71.png?width=1970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b66b892d97ef5ecef5a2697709201c042d5bdc60</p>
<p>The trading volume and trading value are mixed with the closing price and that makes a difference. You can make a positive and negative volume and trading value with this.</p>
<p>Now if we compare the volume provided from security firms and the divided volume. Also compare the trading value provided and the multiplied trading value. Divided volume and multiplied trading value I have explained it above what I made for convenience. If one is subtracted from each other than the average and the closed price have a difference between them so it‚Äôs comparable.</p>
<p>I'll talk about this for convenience as loss volume, loss trading value.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/5cyjrwi9qse71.png?width=1594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c654d0273bc574a018c9839932309d14782b93</p>
<p>On the daily graph of loss volume and loss trading value we accumulate these numbers. The direction of the cumulative figures is important.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/pwlk9ki9qse71.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9807362840d1a1c4d4e4abe8c8d7ecec0e73d3bf</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/zm93rwi9qse71.png?width=1756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=912ee3bf3050542b2e3b7dc4548530b25aa0c56f</p>
<p>The characteristics shown in the accumulation of loss volume and loss trading value are from the day of Jan 28TH when the buy button was removed by many brokers.</p>
<p>Loss volume is going down.</p>
<p>Loss trading value are going up.</p>
<p>If you interpret this at this time, you‚Äôll be able to know that they shorted the stock with high intensity and the direction of the short sale is trading volume goes down and trading value goes up.</p>
<p>So, we‚Äôre going to divide the accumulated amount of volume and trading value and draw out the loss average. (Here is a mix of close prices closed due to time)</p>
<p>I'll call this the squeeze line for convenience.(The squeeze line is not a cumulative one. Applies to daily figures.)</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/hjhl6mi9qse71.png?width=1945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91368dac0a296c9d3ae8d6045818b21ffb7d11bb</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/52wpf3j9qse71.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11ad99ab9558cc46966b33ec84cd10255430723b</p>
<p>If you look at the graph,</p>
<p>On January 28th, January 29th.The squeeze line has surpassed the closing price.You can see that it went up and down.So if the squeeze line is located on the positive side, not negative,It shows that there is a transaction that affects the short sale.To be more precise, the squeeze line is located higher than the closing price.But you can't just judge everything simply by the squeeze line.</p>
<p>Let me put everything togetherIf we put together all the data from GME so far</p>
<ol>
<li>Accumulation of loss volume decreases,</li>
<li>Accumulation of loss trading value increases</li>
<li>If the squeeze line is negative and is lower than the current closing price,</li>
</ol>
<p>We can conclude that there is a strong short selling going on.</p>
<p>So, if you look at the characteristics of these accumulations the other way around</p>
<ol>
<li>Accumulation of loss volume increases.</li>
<li>Accumulation of loss trading value decreases,</li>
<li>If the squeeze line is positive and higher than the current closing price</li>
</ol>
<p>It means the short sale intensity is coming down and is ready to squeeze.</p>
<p>Now let's apply this to AMC which is actually rising.It's actually going up significantly so if this is the case.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Accumulation of loss volume Increase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accumulation of the loss trading value decreases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The squeeze line must go from negative to positive and must be higher than the current closing price.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the volume and trading value method are the same, we will only look at the important accumulation and squeeze line.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>https://preview.redd.it/ql9v0oi9qse71.png?width=1784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b91a2b0e0bf6849594a8109af11f68a4e375999b</p>
<p>(amc squeeze line)</p>
<p>(The two axes are the default axes. The two axes are the same.)</p>
<p>It's not so perfect as the characteristics as I said before.But losses are now bottoming out and rising.Loss transaction amount are already falling.Squeeze line has already maintained the positive value for half a year.It is much higher than the AMC‚Äôs closing price.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/83ti8n0erse71.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c06e8704760c0ecf29fbe489cf4d085adf9ae949</p>
<p>All three things put together AMC is right before the short squeeze.If the loss volume accumulation rises a little more and the three conditions match then the perfect strong short squeeze is expected to start and there will be a sharp price increase from then on.</p>
<p>That's right.Hedge funds are bleeding from AMC.They are shorting while bleeding like hell.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So GME, AMC's conclusion is...</p>
<ol>
<li>GME's short squeeze was stopped on Jan. 28 and has yet to begin.</li>
<li>I don't know what the trigger will be when GME's short squeeze starts.Loss volume will rise, loss trading value will fall, and squeeze lines will rise to positive numbers, which will be larger than the current closing price.</li>
<li>If the gme goes up, it must be a huge increase. The GME is a really great nuclear missile.</li>
<li>AMC is just before the start of the short squeeze.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, it‚Äôs the stage for longs to whether squeeze AMC or not.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to say is</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/9d6pzo0erse71.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab95bb51002d9c098bf2a744ecc32d5fd80d202e</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt a financial advice</p>
<p>AND this I just wrote down my personal thoughts.</p>
<p>Now we're experiencing great history which will be written in textbooks in the futureI'm not going to be weighed down by the history. I want to survive this journey with everyone, and I hope we can finish it safely.</p>
<p>I reiterateThis situation and the figures may be correct or wrong.</p>
<p>And GME and AMC‚Äôs short-selling section is so clear that the cumulative amount we get around there has effect. Applying this on other stocks? We don't know the short selling period, so I think it's gonna be hard.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I like this stock.</p>
<p>I also love our Apes and the Ape community</p>
