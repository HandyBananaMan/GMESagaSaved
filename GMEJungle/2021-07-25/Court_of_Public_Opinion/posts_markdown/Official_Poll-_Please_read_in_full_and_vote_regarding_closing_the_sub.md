Based on the results of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/opi6uw/state_of_the_jungle_address_lets_talk_about_sub/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it seems the majority of the community wish to close the sub in some capacity. Today, u/BodySurfDan and I are now asking you to officially vote regarding the matter. Given that we seem to be experiencing some reddit admin level spam filtering, we feel this should be addressed now.

&#x200B;

There are different levels of privacy when you close a subreddit, and for the purpose of not appearing to have unnecessary levels of secrecy, the option to close the sub means the following:

&#x200B;

**The subreddit would become "restricted", which is the middle level of privacy settings.** This means that only approved users can post and comment, but the public can view all content (and vote accordingly. I'm honestly not sure if they can award.) Approval will be manually done by Dan and I via modmail at this time, because I'm not getting any responses on any of my attempts to reach out to admin for help. For transparency.. I made a post on requestabot the other night asking for a mass approval bot, but hit dead ends. I have also contacted reddit admin about performing a mass approval on the userbase here so we can lock it up efficiently, but I have not heard back yet. This is the smartest way it seems, because mods do not have access to a membership list. Only reddit admins have that. So for now, it's manual approval only.

&#x200B;

![clicking approve a bazillion times](https://preview.redd.it/mw0b6tsh6ed71.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=b19f9ef78e09890039d83052d9fb31abad3d7aaf)

**Please understand, there will be minimum requirements for approval- lurkers are still going to be welcome for approval.** Because of the amount of time it would take to "investigate" each member before approval, we will be working with the goal of speed in mind. Which means approving basically everyone (unless you're an obvious bad actor) and then letting the shills be sorted among the community later. *So even if you're a low karma lurker, you're in.*

**So what's the minimum requirement?**

# A 15+ day old account. That's it. Karma doesn't matter.

&#x200B;

The reason for doing this is because the vast majority of apes here have been on reddit since before the "fallout" at the other place. And some bans were put in place to keep bad actors from following us here, and it's far too easy to make another reddit account and keep spreading FUD. If you created a new account since the Jungle became inhabited in the last few weeks, I'm sorry but you will be pushed to the back of the line. This seems like the obvious first step in weeding out bad actors.

We have begun approving users that are regular posters in the community (I will also be going through the dailies and previous posts and approving those as priority). We have also started approving those contacting us via modmail. **PLEASE DO NOT DM US DIRECTLY FOR APPROVAL, IT DOESN'T GIVE US THAT OPTION EFFICIENTLY.** I also am eagerly awaiting a response from several attempts at reaching admin and I don't want it to get buried in my personal inbox in approval requests.

&#x200B;

# The only way to get approval is to contact mods via modmail, with the word "approve" in the subject line.

On mobile- modmail is found in the "about" section under moderators- the mail icon.

On Desktop- scroll to the bottom right on the sidebar, under moderators.

# You will receive a message notifying you that you are an approved member of r/GMEJungle.

Edit: shoutout to u/TheLaurenMcKenzie [for this video showing how to send your modmail request](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/orh047/quick_video_of_how_to_send_your_mod_mail_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)!!

*Also, because this will bring a great influx of messages to our modmail inbox, tagging us will be the most efficient way to get our attention to a problem, for the time being. Please keep modmail about other subjects to a minimum for the time being. We appreciate your understanding. :)*

Yes we realize this approval process will likely take several weeks or longer to manually complete the membership. That's what it's gonna take to have a safe space for MOASS and beyond. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

So friends, a vote for **no** means leaving it wide open as is. A vote for **yes** means closing the sub regardless of current member count (*taking away the 100k threshold previously proposed)* and mods manually approving users and only those users being allowed to post and comment (but the public can still view the content.) Poll will be open for 48 hours. Should this be approved by the majority of the community, a results post will be made notifying everyone of the closing. Given the timeline of the poll, you can expect the results post to be made Tuesday after hours or Wednesday, depending. Which would mean the sub effectively closing Wednesday or so, if that's what's decided.

&#x200B;

Dan and I both appreciate the vigilance of everyone in this community that has been helping fortify the walls and keep the bad shit out. Y'all are rocking on the tags and it's been so refreshing to actually get to step away from time to time and live life again because I know you apes have got it under control. I love this community. ‚ù§
