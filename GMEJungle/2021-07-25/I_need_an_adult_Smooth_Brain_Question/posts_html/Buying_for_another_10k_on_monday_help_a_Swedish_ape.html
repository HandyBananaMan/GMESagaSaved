<p>So I’m feeling way too hyped for august and with macd crossing soon I decided to add some more gme to my already 100% gme portfolio. </p>
<p>I’m buying for 10k ish.
I’ve been buying on avanza before and planning to do it again. 
But I thought maybe I should check here first, is there a way for me to make sure my shares can’t be routed through darkpool?</p>
<p>Edit: lmfao getting downvoted</p>
<p>Edit 2: Im pretty sure it’s impossible to route it through IEX when placing an order on avanza, but will definitely call them tomorrow! 
that’s why this post</p>
