I know you apes tend to get scared looking into anything with the GME coin or NFT info, but I promise it's way less scary once you dig in.

Figuring out what the EmailSignature 1337 token ID is going to do has been my burning passion for months of lurking.

This is what happens when you search Gamestop on [Opensea.io](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61a80d1792340c2a03e739202980e69467459a8b)

I present this all to you to make sure you know you can look into this stuff too. I promise. I was stuck being a lurker for months and had no one to talk to about any of this except my poor lovely gf. Look into this stuff too, so I have more apes to discuss this shit with.

TLDR: Make an account and familiarize yourself with the NFT and Eth shit because it's clearly going to be pivotal in the moves Gamestop will be making next. An informed ape is a helpful and prepared ape.
