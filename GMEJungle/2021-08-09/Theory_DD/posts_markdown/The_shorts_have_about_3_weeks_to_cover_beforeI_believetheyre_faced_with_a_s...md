# Title: The shorts have about 3 weeks to cover before—I believe—they’re faced with a surge of buying pressure funded (directly or indirectly) by low-interest, federal student loans.

As a full-time graduate student, full-time employee, and full-time ape:
- I earn $XX,XXX in salary,
- I finance my grad school with $XX,XXX in student loans, and
- I owe $XX,XXX in student-loan debt.

While my salary would be enough to cover the majority of my grad school tuition and living expenses, I still accept the maximum amount of federal student loans that I am eligible for.  Under normal circumstances, this allows me to fully fund my tuition and related living expenses with these loans, defer most of my debt payments, and direct my salary to paying off my outstanding, higher-interest debt one at a time.

But these aren’t normal circumstances; there is an opportunity at play here to 1) pay off all of my student loans, 2) never have to work again, and 3) have more money than I ever dreamed of.  All I have to do is **BUY** and **HOLD**.  That sounds like a bargain to me.

With federal student loans disbursing at the end of the month, essentially this leaves me—and, *probably*, other like-minded student apes—with the opportunity to live comfortably from the end of August through May, all the while dumping **up to** my entire $XX,XXX salary into $GME and GameStop merchandise.  **If the shorts can kick the can down the road, so can I.**

Will this increased buying pressure ignite the MOASS?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  HOWEVER, I can say with the utmost certainty: **Hedgies are SO fucked.**

**Edit 1 (4:25 PM):** “cover” in the title should actually read “close”.
 
 
**Edit 2 (6:32 PM):** Some apes appear to be misunderstanding.  I certainly don’t intend to dump my ***entire*** salary into $GME. That’s why I said I will have the ***”opportunity”*** to dump ***“up to*** *my entire … salary.”*  Emphasis on “opportunity” and “up to.”

I’m merely stating that student loan disbursements at the end of this month provide myself—and the **many** other apes that I assume came to this same conclusion—the **opportunity** to dump portions of their student loans or salaries (now that they have student loans to cover their living expenses) into $GME or GameStop merchandise.  And I believe that the aggregate will cause increased buying pressure.

Again, I’m not advocating for anyone to do anything; I’m making an observation and hypothesizing on its impact.
