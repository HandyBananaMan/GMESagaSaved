    "selftext": "Hello my beloved fellow primates.\n\nIt\u2019s weekend and we can\u2019t stare at stock charts now. Or you\u2019re as smooth brained as yours truly and do so anyway. While doing that and snorting some old red and green crayola I found under the sofa, a thought came to me: What the fuck actually is that infinity pool? How does it work? I want one in all of my mansions so I can watch the sunset while sitting in my slowly sinking lambo but I have the slight suspicion that something else is meant - so what\u2019s the deal?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nice catch!](https://preview.redd.it/vrcaudy004g71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34948516dcdb355a5a49efb9e5e70bf8c3eae468)\n\nThis is not financial advice, my cranial topography is similar to a bowling ball and about as well supplied with blood from mindlessly staring at TA in a completely artificially moving stock so don\u2019t listen to me. I buy puts on my own brain cells that which as inflated as the true share count.\n\n# So... Infinity Pool, yeah\n\nThe Infinity Pool is the number of shares an ape decides to never sell, regardless of how high or low the price goes during MOASS. So far so good, but why should anyone do that apart from for the lulz or giving them to his wife\u2019s boyfriend? Let\u2019s dive a bit deeper for that.\n\nThe point of the Infinity Pool is to leverage this once-in-forever situation for maximum effect in order to achieve real systemic change so problems like the collapse of the climate ecosystem, exploitation of  hard-working everyday citizens or war crimes like clamshell packaged donuts are forced to stop. That won\u2019t happen by saying pretty please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Actually, that was 2011](https://preview.redd.it/gguxmh7404g71.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a619ee2cf95080d2569cb65dc583d9870c51d354)\n\n# How many shares are there to buy?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s see how many shares there should be \u2013 shares that actually have been issued by GameStop Corp. According to yahoo!Finance, there should be a [float of about 56,410,000 shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME). Some apes with actual grey matter in their skulls instead of the expired ice cream that oozes out of my ears have put together some data on how big the float acktyually could be \u2013 bear in mind that definitive data on that is impossible for us to get so this really is just an estimate. Estimates range from [140% (78,974,000 shares)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndn2vt/some_of_you_may_not_be_aware_but_gme_had_ftds_all/) to [800,000% (451,280,000,000 shares)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/oyybhy/hedgies_really_do_be_fuk_doe/). In my opinion both are very unrealistic, but from all I\u2019ve read since February, I believe we can safely assume that they created enough counterfeit shares to short the float AT LEAST ten to twenty times over (564,100,000 to 1,128,200,000 shares). Let\u2019s go for the middle and say there are **846,150,000** shares held by apes. I can\u2019t find the in-depth DD on this number because Reddit search function is a joke but that number is around what apes with actual wrinkles also estimated. *If anyone has saved that DD please post a link in the comments.*\n\n# To never let it be squozen\n\nThey do not have to buy up every single share of the float, they only have to close the fake positions (naked shorts), so in this approximation 846,150,000 \u2013 56,140,000 = 789,740,000 shares to cover and the squeeze is over. The point of the infinity pool is to never let the squeeze stop in order to eject every single one of the bad actors from the market by driving them into insolvency. This is because even though we\u2019re bashing Citadel all the time, there\u2019s actually a large network of assholes out there who are all involved and who might get away with a black eye only to continue to make everyone\u2019s lives miserable afterwards. So the idea is to dismantle the rotten old system brick by brick. A bit like my wife  did to me in our divorce.\n\nIn order for the hedgies to not be able to ever close their positions, retail would ideally hold back another float worth of shares. That means 789,740,000 \u2013 56,140,000 = 733,330,000 shares that can be sold by apes  without touching the Infinity Pool.\n\nAlright, so how do I know how much of my shares I can sell? That\u2019s easy:\n\n(733,330,000 \\* 100) / 846,150,000 = **86,6667%.**\n\nSo  just roughly 13,6% of your shares = Infinity Pool in this approximation. In this scenario, if you have 7 shares and you hold one back, you\u2019re golden and still have more tendies after the floor than my ex had complaints about me. The remaining share will keep rising in value and the infinite money glitch is on. If there really are more fake shares out there than that, the infinity squeeze is even more certain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A tale that will be sung for generations](https://preview.redd.it/zoving7704g71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=141cef7e2a690faaf6214cf67d9f8add8b915d68)\n\n# Is there enough money?\n\nWe keep rising \u201cthe floor\u201d every time we catch hedgies at fuckery. Because that\u2019s essentially every fucking day they are kicking the can, there\u2019s a nice tool called [gmefloor.com](https://gmefloor.com/) that simply counts up like a clock. The floor means the price at which the first diamond handed apes feel free to START selling their first shares \u2013 mind you, it\u2019s not the peak but the BEGINNING. They would have to buy every share for at least that price. And yes, there is enough money to pay us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/freeworldeconomicreport.com\\/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization\\/](https://preview.redd.it/yqs0itw904g71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a9378cae0858d15e059279cc64424f5ab10054)\n\nThe nice effect if enough apes diamond hand to the floor is that even apes with only one share get to have a chance to escape poverty. Maybe I won\u2019t *have to* give blowies behind Wendy\u2019s then any more.\n\nThe floor is already so high that the first line of bad actors \u2013 the ones  that delay the MOASS \u2013 will go bust immediately once it begins. In the end, the Fed can also just print the money to pay us essentially. What really means a systemic threat that could break this rotten system is this concept of the Infinity Pool. If it will never be possible to close all positions the fallout will only grow and force everyone to consider  systems that are not as easily corruptible \u2013 for example blockchain based stock ledgers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[We have nothing to lose but everything to win](https://preview.redd.it/avpkilyb04g71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0ea8e3802ef38e2dd8eb6b89abb8e7c560fc5de)\n\n**TA/DR:**  The Infinity Pool makes the share price go up forever. It should work  if every ape hodls about 13,5% of the owned shares. If we follow the floor, everyone will still be rich af.",
