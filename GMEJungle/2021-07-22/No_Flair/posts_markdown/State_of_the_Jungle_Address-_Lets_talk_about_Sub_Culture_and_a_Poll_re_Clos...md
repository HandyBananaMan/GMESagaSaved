Let's get right to it. 

&#x200B;

First of all, u/BodySurfDan has moderator permissions and has been hanging out in the comments and helping keep the sub tidy and really just made a huge difference. I am so grateful to have such a respectful, present, true ape to help make this place awesome. He's quick on the tags and super responsive, definitely keeping it groovy. Thanks Dan! 🤝

For the last day or so users have been tagging us because their posts aren't showing up in New, but they show up to their profile. Some posts are straight up being removed by some sort of spam filter, as [Dan referenced here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/opdclw/reddit_implementing_a_new_spam_filter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and it seems to be affecting more than just this sub. To test and make sure it's not something internal causing this issue, **I have removed all automod filters at this time.**

This will help us to know that the content dilution and removal is not happening internally. Dan and I are keeping a close eye on this and encourage you to keep tagging us if your posts keep disappearing in this manner. **At this point, there are zero karma and age restrictions, so there should be zero automod removals for any reason at this time. Scroll cautiously while we test. It appears there may be a site wide shadow ban on certain themed subreddits, but we have no confirmation at this time.**

It's obvious there are shills and bots in our midst, we knew they would come. So all we can do right now is keep voting with our thumbs and countering FUD with facts. As you've probably seen, Dan and I are predominately only banning upon the request of apes in the comments, and like to keep the discussion to do so out in the open for everyone to see and weigh in. I would like to keep the majority of bans, to public opinion. I also encourage everyone to become familiar with the rules as they are written, and let us know if you have questions or want clarification. These are the cornerstones of our culture. You guys are doing an amazing job of popping out the shills like pimples on the butt of the sub. Way to go at keeping this place groovy yourselves, seriously!

# New Post Flairs

&#x200B;

You may have noticed, there are some shiny new post flairs for you to use when posting and sorting here in the Jungle. 

https://preview.redd.it/8mk45e3fhsc71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99559166982f4babe3f05da0a9b4ace9e9e32be3

Please use them appropriately and be advised that we mods may change post flairs if one is more appropriate for your post. This is not a disciplinary action, just a step we can take to help keep the jungle kinda organized!

# New Community Awards

&#x200B;

There are also some shiny new awards that I have no idea how to credit the original artist for. These submissions have been in a file on my computer awaiting an awards contest that never happened over on the other sub, and I like to see them put to good use. If you were the original artist of these awards, or you know who is, lmk so I can hook them up with an award for a free month of premium or something! And special thank you to u/SanchothePancho for creating the new Jungle Award. Thank you to them and everyone submitting awesome content that makes this place feel like home. 💖

# Now, Let's Talk Sub Culture

&#x200B;

Imagine WSB and Superstonk had a dirty, hairy, smooth brain lil monkey baby child that neither of them really wants to take care of and they're left in the jungle to fend for their own; that's r/GMEJungle.

&#x200B;

I don't mind sailor talk and $GME-relevant theories. This sub is meant to be a welcoming place for all apes interested in discussion about their $GME investment. Most of us miss the culture of WSB pre-January, and the spirit of Superstonk in those first few weeks. We want to keep both of those things alive here as long as we can. And censorship and silencing only piss people off. You are welcome to express yourself pretty freely here, within the rules and overall theme of the sub of course (which I strongly encourage you to become familiar with). The community decides the content on the front page of the sub with their up and down votes. Yes I realize these can be manipulated. All we can really do right now is fight the fucking FUD with facts. And use our opposable thumbs like good little evolved apes! 🦍👍👎

&#x200B;

**The purpose of this subreddit is not to become the next Superstonk or GME main sub. Quite the opposite.** There are already a few DD subs and the celebrity Superstonk sub. That's not us. I don't want media exposure or to make the member count jump, nor do I thirst for the front page, it only brings on trolls and shills. I really did create this subreddit months back as a safe place in case other subs became uncool. And I want to keep it open to the "lurkers" who have been welcome to come out of hiding and are so excited to just be able to interact with their fellow shareholders. The karma and age restrictions were at the bare minimum to help foster this. Everyone has really enjoyed the daily thread here so I'm trying to make sure that stays a fun place to hang out during the trading day. Original memes are also always welcome, just bring your A game. We have many meme connoisseurs in our midst, but we all love some good hype.

**The purpose of this subreddit is not to direct you when you buy or sell or collude in any way.**.. there is no restriction to how you handle your shares here. There is no enforcement mechanism for paper hands, no repercussions for trading in any way at any time. It's not illegal to proclaim or retain ownership of something you own, nor to declare that you wish to own the asset forever (i.e. infinity pool). We don't discuss specific number of positions here, and we don't agree to behave in sync with them in any way. **We just like the stock.** (TL;DR of that- Idgaf what you do with your shares, just don't talk about specifics. I'm HODLing til phone numbers ✌ )

&#x200B;

# Having said that, as it says in the rules.. "Us" and "we" refers to the members of this subreddit only, not a collective of traders acting in unison on a trade.

&#x200B;

I want to stress that theories and discussion of fuckery is welcome here, whether it's on a Federal stock market level or a Reddit level. This community was built by and for apes who know to think for themselves. 

# We say fuck your FUD, I do my own research and come to my own conclusion based on facts that I can source for you right now.

![lil rebel](https://preview.redd.it/24ec5nksksc71.png?width=266&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8ab688e3812f5cd63b09873568b5960d2a52533)

I feel I/we have been gaslighted for a while in this process and as the fog begins to clear, we need an open space to discuss what's happening as this $GME saga develops. **That's the purpose of this subreddit. To be an open, welcoming, safe space for apes invested in $GME to discuss freely what is happening within the stock and the subculture of the stock.** 

As I said earlier, I want to preserve the culture for us as long as we can. Having said that, I pose a question. Note this is not an official vote for action, just a gauge of temperament. 

&#x200B;

**Do we want to close the sub at 100,000 members?**

&#x200B;

We are at 75k+ right now. To close the sub would render it basically useless to unapproved members until we can approve users, and you would be perusing other subs until it gets cleared up. I'm not sure exactly how long that would take based on reddit's overall approval restrictions. But it's something we're willing to do to keep this place safe from too many trolling infiltrators, and can always be opened up again should the community decide to do so. So what would happen if we close the sub? From r/modguide:

>Private subs are just that. Only mods and those invited can see the sub. To invite someone basically means adding them to the approved submitters list.   
>  
>Users can request invites via modmail and a button to do this is shown on the sub. Uninvited users basically see a splash page informing them that the sub is private and they must message to ask for access. 

&#x200B;

So given this information, I pose the question to the community if we wish to close the sub to "Private" at any time, suggested at 100k. Please vote and discuss accordingly! 

&#x200B;

# Remember this is not a vote to action, just a gauge of temperament for discussion, to see if it's worth promoting to action.

&#x200B;

Thank you guys for being such an awesome part of this whole experience, and for loving the stock and community enough to take charge here and make a difference. 💪
