    "selftext": "I know because I asked. Their insurance is through Lloyds of London.  I asked all this a few months ago. I wanted to know for when the MOASS happened. Interesting thing I also learned is they are not a bank so it\u2019s not FDIC insured from my understanding. Remember they are private and family owned still. They said they will act as a bank though even allowing direct deposit (about the most apeish thing I can think of to do is direct deposit your paycheck into your brokerage account). They will even give you a ATM card that you can use at any ATM and they will reimburse you for any fees. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s profitable for them but that\u2019s what they told me. Blew my mind kind of. Stay fucking Zen. Buy Hold Repeat.",
