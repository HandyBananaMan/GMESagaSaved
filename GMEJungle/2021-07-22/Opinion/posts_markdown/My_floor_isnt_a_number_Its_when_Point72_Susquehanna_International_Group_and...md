These are the three major players when it comes to (naked) shorting GME.

Only then will I CONSIDER selling one share. 

Not financial advice, I am a lurking retard.


*edit: I see a few posts saying I would close my position or sell... read the inside of the post (right above)! This situation is unique and fluid and I imagine will never happen again; which is why I chose my words carefully and said I would CONSIDER selling one share at that point.
