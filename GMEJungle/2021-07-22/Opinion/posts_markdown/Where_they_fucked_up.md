Before I begin, yes this is a basically unused account. Before GME I never went on Reddit, and damn it feels good to finally be able to post somewhere. Call me a shill, suck my dick, see if I care. Lemme tell you a story about where they fucked up. 

So, being the smooth brained shit thrower that i am, I got into GME late. My first few shares were bought at around 400, but with money I was 100% willing to lose. See I was looking at putting down a deposit for a mortgage, which was real big shit for me so money was tight, but I had a bit extra to play with and thought fuck it. 

Now when I bought those shares, I was expecting to sell at 1000. If I’m honest, even 1000 was a pipe dream, but I figured making a few k would be a nice little bump into the mortgage, or at the very least buy some furniture etc. 

Then boom. 40 bucks a share. I almost just wrote the money off, a funny story to tell. But then I saw the community rallying, I read more DD, and damn, I started to believe. So, I started averaging down. 

Now as a poor fucker (not poor poor, but not dropping 10k on stocks either) I was worried about going balls deep, but the more I read the more I was convinced. At this point, the full house fund is in GME. Now for me, that only equates to high-ish XX shares (can we post positions here? I never saw the results of the vote) but damn it feels good. 

Now let me tell you why they fucked up. 

They dragged this out. 

I guarantee there are thousands of apes like me, who got in at a bad time with dumb money, just to ride the rollercoaster and have a laugh, maybe make some cash in the process. We were looking to 1000 with hope, but no real expectation. I genuinely believe that if we hit 1000 in January, enough apes would have sold to dig them out of the shitshow they are in. 

But not any more. I know that when it hits 1000, I’ll hold. 
When it hits 10000, I’ll hold. 
When it hits 1000000, I’ll hold. 
You get the idea. 

And while my XX shares might be a drop in the bucket, by dragging this out they have added SO MANY drops into that bucket that it will crush them. 

TL;DR - Came for a laugh and a quick buck, stayed for life changing money and moon parties 

Godspeed Apes; may your lambos be quick and your brains be smooth
