OK guys and gals, buckle up, I think I'm onto something here. After CosmicLightningWarrior explained how margin calls work on YouTube last evening, I had an idea of how to find a window for margin call prices, without knowing total number of shares.

&#x200B;

Taking into factor that the Federal Reserve has been doing all these unprecedented RRP's to get a hold of the coronavirus inflation, I think we can reasonably deduce what the margin call is most likely at, or at least be damn near close to it, due to the FRB last time I checked has been holding the cash and most likely won't be giving it at negative rates.

Since these big players have been RRP'ing wholetime, not to mention the floods of liquidity we see ebb in and flow out, we can reasonably state that it is safe to treat the SI's for the most major players like a loan, no frills, no extra numbers technically needed. Which means the data we are lacking to actually make a 100% unbiased, informed decision we have been lacking may be a moot point!Now that we've covered a few perifreral facts, let's get clsoer towards the numbers. And the numbers are fucking JUICY BABY!

&#x200B;

Next, let's explain what's going down and why I believe that number is the best to figure out where the call is at. Margin calls go down over time as buying pressure goes up, but it is actually based on how long one remains in SI or loaned stocks over time. That being said, we can forego that for the straight margin call number, just without those variables in place, of which every single variable is in our favor. This is usually represented by:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

MCP=IPP \* (1-IM/1-MM) 

&#x200B;

where MCP = Margin Call Price, IPP = Initial Purchase Price, IM = Initial Margin, and MM = Maintenance Margin

&#x200B;

Let's talk NYSE regulatioins for a quick second to understand what numbers we should use and why.

&#x200B;

Initial margin must be at least 150% of share value, plus an additional 25% for SI on NYSE, Maintenance margin

I'm sure it is somewhere in some rules, but I'm on a time crunch today. And yes, FINRA has less requirements, but I trade on NYSE, and so does the Sithadel, and we shall go with NYSE's more stringent requirements, because Sithadel is located in Chicago they must be making these SI positions from there.

&#x200B;

Let's assume they closed positions and immediately reopened on Jan 28th at 483.  Why? Because these greedy fucks would make a whole lot more, if they managed to FUD us into paperhanding and dropped stocks of GME to 0. Sorry, you only got Paperhands Portnoy on that one. This would also be rational, as they assumed it was a fucking joke that we like the stock and we want to save Gamestop. No joke, we want our midnight release parties back, we want our children to have this cultural, economic asset, and we want that sweet, sweet Margin Call Price.

&#x200B;

So we have our 483 initial purchase price, our initial margin of 150, and maintenence margin of 25%

&#x200B;

So Let's plug and play. NB the absolute values are because you can't have a negative value, so I presumed it was inherently obvious that IM/MM must be an absolute value.

&#x200B;

MCP = 483 \* |(1-1.50/1-.30)|

&#x200B;

MCP = 483 \* (.5/.7)

&#x200B;

MCP = 483 \* .714285

&#x200B;

MCP = 344.999655 , rounded up MCP = 345 on the dot. That's right, it's Pythagorean. One point for simulation theory! The price is wrong, but the triangles are right.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's a rough estimate, but this is pure tit-jack-ulation if I ever seen it. This figure is disregarding buying volume, amount of float available on market, and probably a lot of other variables. This also is the higher end of what the margin call can be. As in, it can in theory be much lower.

&#x200B;

Let's say, for some odd reason, like rolling over capital or having so much liquidity on the right days, that the initial margin is 125% (about the lowest you can go that I'm aware of), the maintenance margin is at the highest that we would get it at at (40%)

&#x200B;

MCP = 483 \* |(1-1.25/1-.4)|

&#x200B;

MCP = 483 \* (0.416 repeating)

&#x200B;

MCP = 201.25

&#x200B;

Let's call this the MCP hit box. The MCP could be anywhere in between these two extremities, and this is giving the SI parties their best chances statistically.

&#x200B;

AM I TELLING YOU THAT WE'VE BEEN THIS CLOSE FOR THIS LONG? YOU'RE GOD BLESSING RIGHT I AM! AM I SAYING THE DIPS HAPPEN BECAUSE WE ARE THAT CLOSE? AWE YEAH I AM! WOO BABY!

I am not a cat, I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. I pooped my pants making this, and not from excitement.
