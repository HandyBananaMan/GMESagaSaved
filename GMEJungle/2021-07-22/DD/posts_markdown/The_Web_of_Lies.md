**I'd like to preface this by saying if this post needs any more context/sources at any point shout it out and I will do my best to add it.**

**TLDR:** This is basically a "how to avoid rules for hedgies handbook" I've written up. Dark pools are just the surface and they have been washing si%, delaying orders, and much more I haven't found. They do so using system internalisers which are unreported exchanges that follow rules set by MiFID 2.

The recent uncovering of "[system internalisers"](https://www.esma.europa.eu/data-systematic-internaliser-calculations) has had my mind racing, if there are 250 of these off exchange non-reported dark pools, how hard could it be? So I decided to think like the rats these people are, and you won't believe what I've found. **Introduce, Tradingweb**, a one stop shop for all of your nefarious needs, this service allows you to trade off exchange, unreported, and has a built in short interest washing mechanism. Take a look at the brochure!

**Citadel Connect is a system internaliser.**

Let's start by looking into who Tradingweb is owned by, I want to get this information out fast so this DD will be **lacking severely on the number crunching aspect of things**. You may know a few of the large owners of this company, here's a list.

And the honorary mention goes to **Blackstone**, a fund that specializes in "Private Equity" trading. Much more research to be done there.

**Since** [**Tradingweb is an APA**](https://www.tradeweb.com/our-markets/data--reporting/trade-reporting-services-apa/) **they are the ones being reported to (conflict of interest) and go by very loose regulations under** [**MiFID 2**](https://www.afme.eu/portals/0/globalassets/downloads/publications/afme-mifidii-mifir-post-trade-reporting-requirements.pdf) **(Section 2), we cannot get accurate short data.**

**If you're still unsure of this and are asking yourself "what does any of this have to do with GME?" fear not, I have some decent evidence of a large connection between this service and gme**.

During our March run from $40, we can see volume traded take a massive spike, and then oddly cool off to around exactly what it was at the month prior.

**Yikes! That's a lot of outstanding shares!** ![**https://imgur.com/a/WitabYH**](https://imgur.com/a/WitabYH) and https://imgur.com/a/tvuwSKB (so you can see it)

**It isn't clear whether the banks involved are trying to profit from this or taking short positions, but this points to the idea that they are heavily involved.** Here is data for total volume traded under TradingWeb [https://cdn.tradeweb.com/49f717/globalassets/newsroom/monthly-activity-reports/june-2021/tw-historical-adv-and-day-count-through-june-2021.pdf](https://cdn.tradeweb.com/49f717/globalassets/newsroom/monthly-activity-reports/june-2021/tw-historical-adv-and-day-count-through-june-2021.pdf) **(See page 15)**

I have not gone deep enough to find how they wash short interest %, nor do I honestly believe I could, but the fact a service like this can be up and running for who knows how long is abhorrent. They do this right in front of our faces with no consequence, then proceed to call people insane for thinking such a thing could be possible. The evidence is overwhelming and at this point is publicly available for all to see. **The people are watching!**
