This could be something, or it could be nothing.\n\nIt seems to me that every time Steve C0hen or P0int72 are brought up, some drama takes over the entire feed.\n\nI am posting this, cause I'm curious - and I want other wrinklebrains to look at it.\n\nI may have found a connection to the whole thermostat brry tweet.\n\nHe posted his tweet on June 21st, stating that \"The fine print matters more today, even if you would rather ignore it more than ever today.\" This was his caption on top of a thermostat that reads 72.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne quick search through the SEC's supercomputer and i found this filing, posted 5 days before Brry's 72 tweet:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Form 40-6B\\/A Filed on 06-16-2021](https://preview.redd.it/jwdqsanlrqc71.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=2957c057668697ec121428b679f90f4c85054ff9)\n\nWut in exemption filing? [https://sec.report/Document/0000895345-21-000552/](https://sec.report/Document/0000895345-21-000552/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[?](https://preview.redd.it/5dfpd2sdsqc71.png?width=1639&format=png&auto=webp&s=b52a96866988693d00eebd4cb6fd39a183636421)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. This here is all way above my head. I aint fluent in legalese or math, and that might show. I am however efficient in google, and i found this quoted from [fedseclaw.com](https://fedseclaw.com), posted in 2018.\n\n**From the Federal Securities Law Source:**\n\nOne of the **worse** situations a company may face to be determined to be  an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as  amended (the act). If determined to be an investment company, the  company is subject to the full regulation under the act. In addition, a  company may inadvertently become an investment company; in such a case,  all of its contracts are potentially voidable and it cannot engage in  any other business. Generally, companies inadvertently become investment  companies by virtue of their investments in certain securities which  trigger the act\u2019s 40 percent test.\n\nMany times a number of companies fall within the definition of an  investment company because operating companies have **large amounts of  assets invested in cash management instruments, government securities  and money market funds.**\n\nThe act is draconian in its regulation and can change the entire  business of a company. If a company inadvertently becomes an investment  company, it must defend itself from SEC regulation and change its  investment policies.\n\nSection 3(a)(a)(A) of the act defines an investment company as an  issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in an  investment company business; Section 3(a)(1)(B) defines an investment  company as an issuer that is a face-amount certificate company; and  Section 3(a)(1)(C) defines an investment company as an issuer that holds  more than 40 percent of its assets (other than cash and government  securities) in investment securities.\n\nAn issuer is any person who issues or proposes to issue any security  or has outstanding any security that he or she has issued. A security is  defined in Section 2(a)(36) of the act to be any of the following: any  note, stock, treasury stock, security future, bond, debenture, evidence  of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any  profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, transferable  share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of  deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas or  other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on  any security, or any put, call, straddle, option or privilege entered  into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency or,  in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a security.\n\nInadvertent investment companies\n\n**Under Section 3(a)(1(C) of the act, an issuer may become an  investment company if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the  business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in  securities and it owns or proposes to acquire, investment securities  having a value exceeding 40 percent of the value of its total assets,  exclusive of government securities and cash items, on a consolidated  basis.**\n\nAvoidance of regulation under the act\n\nFortunately, there are exceptions to registration under the act which  issuers can fall under. In addition, there are a number of exemptions  from registration available to issuer.\n\nSection 3(c)(1) of the act excepts from the definition of investment  company \u201cany issuer whose outstanding securities (other than short-term  paper) are beneficially owned by not more than 100 person and which is  not making and does not presently propose to make a public offering of  it securities.\u201d\n\nIn order to take advantage of this exception, no more than 100  persons may beneficially own the issuer\u2019s outstanding securities, other  than short-term paper. In addition, the beneficially owned securities  may be voting or non-voting securities. A beneficial owner is generally  determined by whether such person has the ability to decide whether, or  how much, to invest in those securities. In addition, securities that  are jointly owned by spouses are considered to be owned by one  beneficial owner.\n\nThe various exceptions from the definition of an investment company include the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Any person primarily engaged in the business of underwriting and  distributing securities issued by other persons, selling securities to  customers, acting as a broker, and acting as market intermediary, or any  other or more of such activities, whose gross income normally is  derived principally from such business and related activities\n* A depository institution or a branch or agency of a foreign bank, a  member bank of the Federal Reserve System, any other banking institution  or trust company, whether incorporated or not, doing business under the  laws of any state or of the United States, and a receiver, conservator,  or other liquidating agent of any institution or firm included above\n* Any common trust fund or similar fund maintained by a bank  exclusively for the collective investment and reinvestment of moneys  contributed thereto by a bank in its capacity as a trustee, executor,  administrator or guardian, if such funds are employed by the bank solely  as an aid to the administration of trusts, estates, or other accounts  created and maintained for a fiduciary purposes; except in connection  with the ordinary advertising of the bank\u2019s fiduciary services,  interests in such fund are not advertised or offered for sale to the  general public; and fees and expenses charged by such fund are not in  contravention of fiduciary principles established under applicable  federal or state law\n* Any person substantially all of whose business is confined to making small loans, industrial banking or similar businesses\n* A company organized as an insurance company, whose primary and  predominant business activity is the writing of insurance or the  reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies, and which is  subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner or a similar  official or agency of a state, or any receiver or similar official or  any liquidating agent for such company, in his capacity as such\n* Any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable  securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic  payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more  of the following businesses: purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes,  drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations  representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance,  and services; making loans to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers  of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise, insurance  and other services; and purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and  other liens on and interests in real estate\n* Any company primarily engaged, directly or through majority-owned  subsidiaries, in one of more businesses, e.g., majority-owned  subsidiary, holding companies, or in one or more of such businesses  (from which not less than 25 percent of such company\u2019s gross income  during its last fiscal year was derived) together with an additional  business or businesses other than investing, reinvesting, owning,  holding, or trading in securities\n* Any issuer, the outstanding securities of which are owned  exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such  securities, are qualified purchasers, and which is not making and does  not at that time propose to make a public offering of such securities\n* Any person substantially all of whose business consists of owning or  holding oil, gas, or other mineral royalties or leases, or fractional  interests therein, or certificates of interest or participation in or  investment contracts relative to such royalties, leases or fractional  interests\n\n**Summary**\n\n*Companies active in investing or reinvesting in companies need to be  aware of the act in order to avoid registering as an investment company.*  ***Many companies who inadvertently become investment companies must stop  their current activities and rearrange their investment strategies.***  *However, due to the number of exceptions available to issuers, companies  need to take advantage of them and modify their practices to avoid  registration under the act.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it noteworthy? I don't know. As I've already told you, I am a smoothbrain. Hopefully someone can come in and explain wut mean. I feel like it could possibly be a tie to Crip-toe, from what I've read and actually managed to soak up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: TLDR: Essentially this is a filing for **Exemption** of the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nWhat is the Act of 1940?\n\n   \n\n* The Investment Company Act of 1940 is an act of Congress that  regulates the formation of investment companies and their activities.\n* The legislation in the Investment Company Act of 1940 is enforced and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n* Companies seeking to avoid the product obligations and requirements of the Act may be eligible for an exemption.\n* **The Act was signed into law by FDR who wanted to protect investors  after the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that  followed.**\n* The Act has gone through many changes over the decades as financial markets have evolved and become more complex.\n\nThe question then is - Why would someone want to be exempted from the regulation of the SEC?",
