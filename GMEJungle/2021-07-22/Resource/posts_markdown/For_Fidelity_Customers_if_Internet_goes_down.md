Fellow Apes...

For any reason if the internet goes down and something crazy happens where you can not trade, please use their Fidelity Fast line.

 [Fidelity's Automated Service Telephone (FAST)](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/phone-numbers/fast/overview) 

Also go ahead and download their PDF and get yourself oriented with all the helpful hints on their info page.

Good luck out there!
