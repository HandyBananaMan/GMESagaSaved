<p>I know where diamonds come from and ain't about to bling.<br />
Ain't got no fancy car. I can't afford my rent.<br />
Ain't even got my own style. Sometimes I'm 50 Cent.<br />
But I ain't got not bullets. And I ain't bullet proof.<br />
And you can take your aim, but you can't kill the truth.<br />
Ay, yo, untie that noose. Son, we ain't free, we're loose.<br />
I'm sleeping on the floor above your party's burning roof.<br />
And when that party's through, here's what you need to do.<br />
Just hold that mic right to your heart and hear the beat of you.<br />
I got a heart beat produced by God, and, boy, it sounds hard.<br />
