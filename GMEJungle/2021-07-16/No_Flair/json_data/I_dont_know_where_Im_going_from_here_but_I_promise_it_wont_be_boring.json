GMEJungle is my abandoned sub idea from before modship over there but I guess since I'm permanently banned, here I am. You asked, here's something. Please don't expect much from it.

Evolving. Adaptive. Resilient. And cunning. But they are stronger together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chbuqgrmtmb71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4365e14827e145ca3e0f3ad51f70ae5c7a9f762c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\"It takes a warrior. It takes somebody that's principled that never gives up.\"- WC***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn days when FUD is high and hope is low, every single ape has to realize that it will take the diligence and resilience of a warrior to win this battle.

Do we want to be on the side of right or wrong?\"- WC***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think we all know which side the apes are on. And history will remember. For generations they have been robbing our families, stealing our ideas and our land and resources, negotiating our time and talents for pennies on the dollar, kept us in class and race wars to distract from the fact that... they've been stealing the world's wealth for a lot longer than Gamestop has been a company. And the game stops here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jdxc747jtmb71.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2fc251c5b563cb67639d74f40d6e88bf0328531\n\n***\"How do we want to spend the talents that God gave us?\"-WC***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre we going to let the FUD stop us from using our talents to grow, nurture, and thrive within this golden think tank that is **quickly becoming bigger, mightier, and more precious than the City of Athens?** Or are we going to put our wrinkles to work and create to share, to spread knowledge among our kingdom of apes, new and OG alike, and fortify these great walls we have built from the ashes of WSB and GME. To protect the culture and the inevitable philanthropy and hope that will come from these walls post-MOASS... we are a force to be reckoned with. What we are building together within the walls of this city will stand tall and proud, long after the squeeze has squoze.\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udcaa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0r3pmaaitmb71.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ea580b11d21377d701e68cb934ca601991db0c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\"Ultimately it's going to take massive amounts of people to want to be involved in this to expose it.
