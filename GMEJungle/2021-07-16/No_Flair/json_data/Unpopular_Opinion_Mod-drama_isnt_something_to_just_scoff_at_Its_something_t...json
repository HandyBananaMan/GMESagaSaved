    "selftext": "Before downvoting, please hear me out:\n\nThe reason why GME will work is because of the ability to spread information through social media.\n\nMark Cuban said this himself that the advantage retail traders have is that we can share information at lightning speeds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was through Reddit posts that most of us found out about the stock and learned about naked shorting, DFV, Ryan Cohen, Citadel, Blackrock, NFTs, mainstream media lying, e.t.c.\n\nMods control the flow of posts, they can remove posts, and ban users.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile we might not like it, the \"mod-drama\" that so many roll their eyes at is, in fact, impactful because it often results in a shift of who holds power over the posts.\n\nI think it's important to at least consider what's going on with the people that moderate the posts on the social media platform that we use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd just like it's important to do your own DD, I believe it's at least a *tiny bit* important to decide for yourself who you trust to moderate the information in your feed.\n\nSo while we might not like it, I believe it is important to at least take a glance at the \"drama.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(If you read all this way, thank you! I hope everything will work out. And as usual BUY & HODL! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e)",
    "title": "Unpopular Opinion: \"Mod-drama\" isn't something to just scoff at. It's something that impacts who has moderative control over the flow of information on a subreddit. This exchange of information is what has allowed apes to become aware of GME, naked shorting, and everything else involved.",
