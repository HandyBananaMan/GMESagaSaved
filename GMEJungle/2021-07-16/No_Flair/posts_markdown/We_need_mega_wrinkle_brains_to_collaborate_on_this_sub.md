This shouldn't be a war of the subs. We have concerns that certain mods over on Superstonk have been compromised but 🦍still ❤️🦍. Would be great if doc T, Wes and Lucy could join us. I'd also like to call out to 
u/criand
u/dlauer
u/atobitt
u/homedepothank
And any others I have forgotten to please share their brilliant minds with us over here.
