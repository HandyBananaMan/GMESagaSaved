This was originally posted on the other sub and has been edited for the name. GMEJungle is my abandoned sub idea from before modship over there but I guess since I'm permanently banned, here I am. You asked, here's something. Please don't expect much from it. Idk wtf is happening.

Apes are strong. Evolving. Adaptive. Resilient. And cunning. But they are stronger together.

On days when FUD is high and hope is low, every single ape has to realize that it will take the diligence and resilience of a warrior to win this battle. Leroy Jenkins is within us all.

***"It's up to each of us to make a decision. Do we want to be on the side of right or wrong?"- WC***

&#x200B;

I think we all know which side the apes are on. And history will remember. For generations they have been robbing our families, stealing our ideas and our land and resources, negotiating our time and talents for pennies on the dollar, kept us in class and race wars to distract from the fact that... they've been stealing the world's wealth for a lot longer than Gamestop has been a company. And the game stops here.

***"How do we want to spend the talents that God gave us?"-WC***

&#x200B;

Are we going to let the FUD stop us from using our talents to grow, nurture, and thrive within this golden think tank that is **quickly becoming bigger, mightier, and more precious than the City of Athens?** Or are we going to put our wrinkles to work and create to share, to spread knowledge among our kingdom of apes, new and OG alike, and fortify these great walls we have built from the ashes of WSB and GME. To protect the culture and the inevitable philanthropy and hope that will come from these walls post-MOASS... we are a force to be reckoned with. What we are building together within the walls of this city will stand tall and proud, long after the squeeze has squoze.ðŸ’–ðŸ’ª

Go with your gut. If someone tells you there's a price ceiling, and especially if it's in the (low) thousands, they are ***fucking*** ***liars***\*\*.\*\* You know who tells you that the price ceiling is anything below an absurrrrd amount of money?

&#x200B;

**People that are paid to tell you that. And to sell on the way up. Especially as anything but a limit order. It's confirmed FUD. Ignore, report, correct in the comments. Call out those shill motherFUDers. Remember, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck! ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**

I.E. big lawyer speak for, if you own shares, and your ownership has been diluted (like can be proven by overvoting) because of naked short selling, then **THOSE DAMAGES GIVE SUFFICIENT REASON TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION!**
