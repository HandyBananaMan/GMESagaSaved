#Title: Unpopular Opinion: "Mod-drama" isn't something to just scoff at. It's something that impacts who has moderative control over the flow of information on a subreddit. This exchange of information is what has allowed apes to become aware of GME, naked shorting, and everything else involved.

Before downvoting, please hear me out:

The reason why GME will work is because of the ability to spread information through social media.

Mark Cuban said this himself that the advantage retail traders have is that we can share information at lightning speeds.

It was through Reddit posts that most of us found out about the stock and learned about naked shorting, DFV, Ryan Cohen, Citadel, Blackrock, NFTs, mainstream media lying, e.t.c.

Mods control the flow of posts, they can remove posts, and ban users.

While we might not like it, the "mod-drama" that so many roll their eyes at is, in fact, impactful because it often results in a shift of who holds power over the posts.

I think it's important to at least consider what's going on with the people that moderate the posts on the social media platform that we use.

&#x200B;

And just like it's important to do your own DD, I believe it's at least a *tiny bit* important to decide for yourself who you trust to moderate the information in your feed.

So while we might not like it, I believe it is important to at least take a glance at the "drama."
