<h1>Title: Unpopular Opinion: "Mod-drama" isn't something to just scoff at. It's something that impacts who has moderative control over the flow of information on a subreddit. This exchange of information is what has allowed apes to become aware of GME, naked shorting, and everything else involved.</h1>

<p>Before downvoting, please hear me out:</p>
<p>The reason why GME will work is because of the ability to spread information through social media.</p>
<p>Mark Cuban said this himself that the advantage retail traders have is that we can share information at lightning speeds.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It was through Reddit posts that most of us found out about the stock and learned about naked shorting, DFV, Ryan Cohen, Citadel, Blackrock, NFTs, mainstream media lying, e.t.c.</p>
<p>Mods control the flow of posts, they can remove posts, and ban users.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>While we might not like it, the "mod-drama" that so many roll their eyes at is, in fact, impactful because it often results in a shift of who holds power over the posts.</p>
<p>I think it's important to at least consider what's going on with the people that moderate the posts on the social media platform that we use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And just like it's important to do your own DD, I believe it's at least a <em>tiny bit</em> important to decide for yourself who you trust to moderate the information in your feed.</p>
<p>So while we might not like it, I believe it is important to at least take a glance at the "drama."</p>
