<p>What will cause a mass migration I believe is getting some of the popular users over here. Attobit, criand, banana in the ass guy, Elliot waves, just all of these people in general. Getting them to post here will quickly erode superstonk. </p>
<p>Now I know we shouldn’t hero worship but the migration of there posters will have people out of the loop wondering what’s going on. They are going to follow where the good DD is. </p>
<p>Oh and buy and hold.</p>
