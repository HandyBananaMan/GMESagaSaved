After reading a lot of GME Jungle posts I can better understand the struggle of moderating a sub like this. It's tough to know what's real and what isn't, and make sure you remove only the inaccurate posts. I assume this will get better once we add more mods, but for the time being it's open season for shills and FUD. I'm concerned about the number of completely insane conspiracy theories I've seen posted and upvoted here. On top of that all of the top comments on these conspiracy posts are supportive, and people pointing out the obvious BS are downvoted to the bottom.

Before I get into the posts themselves, I want to address why I'm making this post in the first place. I'm not trying to call anyone in particular out or complain about the mods. I just want to make sure people understand that posts like these are counter-productive to our goals and are how shills introduce FUD. Getting people to believe in wrong theories divides us and sets people up for disappointment when they're proven wrong.

No, SATORI is not owned by Citadel. Do you seriously think Citadel would come up with an AI program to use on the sub, then name it after a product made by a company they own some tiny percent stake in? Not only that, but then announce to the whole community that they're using that product? If common sense isn't enough for you, here's a post from a month ago addressing this BS.

This is a TON of conjecture presented as fact. MOONJAM is a festival being put on jointly by Gamestop and other companies. How does this relate to a catalyst for MOASS? It doesn't, other than the fact it has "moon" in the name. Gamestop advertising a sale this week does not indicate MOASS. Etherium changes don't indicate MOASS. And most importantly the user claims "THEY HAVE NO AMMO LEFT"- despite the fact that everytime this claim has been made it's been wrong.

This is the guy who started the SATORI theory, who claims 

\>   2 engineers/hackers from White Ops (human security) made accounts on reddit, provided proof of who they are, and sent me cryptic warnings and invites to off channel video chats to discuss my post... And to ask me to remove one of their names from my research. 

Given that we know the SATORI thing is BS, anything this guy claims is suspicious. Considering he's the only person who is claiming to have been offered an NDA, it's pretty clear that it's all hogwash. Do we really think that not a single other DD writer turned down the NDA and can verify his claim? But all of the top comments on the post take him at face value.

This one is claiming that Kelly Brennan, Head of ETF at Citadel, is the daughter of former CIA Director John Brennan. Why that matters is unclear, but this idea was debunked the day before [https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/om9mqk/kelly\_brennan\_head\_of\_etf\_at\_shitadel\_securities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/om9mqk/kelly_brennan_head_of_etf_at_shitadel_securities/)

When I pointed out that the post was entirely speculative with no evidence, I wasn't just downvoted to -5 but I was told I was not only wrong but 100% bullshit and that google was my friend. Googling brought me to that link up above, where it's proven that they can't be related. A lot of other apes with skeptical comments were downvoted as well, as the post got 724 upvotes.

In summary, keep a skeptical eye out for the things you read. If someone makes a bold claim, check it out before hitting the upvote arrow. I don't want to see this become the "conspiracy" sub compared to the others.
