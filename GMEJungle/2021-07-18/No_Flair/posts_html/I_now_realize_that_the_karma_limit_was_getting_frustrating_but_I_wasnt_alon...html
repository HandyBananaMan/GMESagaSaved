<p>At first I noticed the good: better posts, less shills (or so I thought at the beginning).</p>
<p>Then I noticed a shift: I wasn't getting approved, but dozens of users with less karma and age then me were actively commenting and some even spreading negative messages.</p>
<p>That's when it all started making me angry and frustrated.</p>
<p>And now I find out that I wasn't alone!</p>
<p>So to all you lurkers and silenced apes, I see you!</p>
<p>And I can finally say in all confidence BUY AND HODL!</p>
