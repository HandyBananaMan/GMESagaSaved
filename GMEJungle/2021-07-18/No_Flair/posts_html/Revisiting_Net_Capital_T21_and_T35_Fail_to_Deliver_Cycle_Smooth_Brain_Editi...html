<p>Most of you guys don‚Äôt know me, but amongst the dumpster fire of Reddit this week, I think there is something crucial we need to talk about. </p>
<p>And instead of having somebody who knows what they are doing talk about it, this is<br />
Net Capital, and Fail To Deliver cycles: Smooth üß† Edition</p>

<p>Shoutout to u/Criand for being one of the coolest MF‚Äôs on Reddit. I‚Äôm a huge fan and I hope I don‚Äôt fuck this up. If I do, please tell me and make my day. I‚Äôm serious. I want to be able to tell people that you told me I was full of shit.  Moving on</p>
<p>This is Criand‚Äôs Net Capital Cycle from a few weeks back.  What‚Äôs I find interesting is that as  June 24th passed without a rise in share price, it seemed like we‚Äôve lost excitement over this cycle. </p>
<p>Again, I hope I‚Äôm understand correctly, but the share offering that GameStop conducted most recently could have bailed the SHF out on this past T+21 cycle. That means that the theory still holds as true as ever, but that it was just pushed back due to the share offering. </p>
<p>I also think that it‚Äôs worth noting that the share offering was just a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated SI%</p>
<p>All of this leads to the fact our next T+21 day cycle happens on July 26th, or the Monday after this next week. </p>
<p>Now, I‚Äôm going to let you in on a secret, I LOVE DATES </p>
<p>Dates are the shit, and nobody can tell me otherwise. As long as mods are busy with their dumpster fire I will continue to rant about dates. </p>

<p>The only think I like more then Dates is dates that either overlap, or run together. That‚Äôs the ENTIRE reason I made this smooth brain post that has been about 99% opinionated, because I am too lazy to source facts and provide them to you. I‚Äôm very possibly full of shit, but I told you that.</p>
<p>Check this shit out.</p>

<p>Somebody has 462,852 Fail to Delivers that went on paper for June 18th. Can anybody guess what 35 calendar days from June 18th is? </p>
<p>You guessed it! Frida_</p>
<p>NO YOU SMOOTH BRAIN</p>
<p>THINK APE THINK</p>
<p>4th of July being a Sunday this year means that we observed Independence Day on July 5th, as you probably remember the markets being closed.</p>
<p>This means that if I‚Äôm not a complete idiot who has completely misinterpreted DD on this sub, and twisted it into my own crazy fan fiction, we have something to look forward to on July 26th. </p>
<p>With all of that said, if you made it this far, I can almost guarantee you are bored AF and just looking for some complimentary stock information.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend apes, turn your phone off and go get laid before you get rich and can‚Äôt trust anybody.  That‚Äôs my advice for
this weekend.  I will now conclude with a famous quote from our sub</p>
<p>‚ÄúDear SHF, </p>
<p>Fuck you, pay me.‚Äù </p>
