<h1>Preface -</h1>
<p>You know who you are. You know what you’ve done. You know what you’ve become. Better said, what you’ve always been. Yet it seems, you’ve all forgotten your place. You were given a platform to help the people, to stand by them, to bind the detractors, the liars, the manipulators, and everything in between. </p>
<p>Instead, you became everything you promised to keep at bay. In your position of <strong><em>appointed</em></strong> power, you made the greatest mistake, <strong><em>to think your power absolute</em></strong><em>.</em> Did you learn <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> <strong>from those who are about to the billions they stole from the people?</strong> </p>
<p>No..I’d argue, how could you? When truly, <strong>you and them act with a singular prerogative</strong>. You know who you are. But it seems you’re good at forgetting, so today I’ll be doing <strong>each and</strong> <strong><em>every</em></strong> <strong><em>single</em></strong> <strong>one of you the favor of reminding you of your identity, and</strong> <strong><em>your place</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Those who would dare manipulate, lie and abuse the people and their trust.</strong> <em>Do you f</em><strong><em>eel it coming?</em></strong> <em>Do you see it</em> <strong><em>forming before you?</em></strong> That’s right, take a good long look into the mirror. Look into the eyes of karma, and realize she ain't no bitch. <strong>She’s you, you’re own undoing.</strong> And in case those who are complicit <strong><em>still</em></strong> do not realize that I’m speaking <strong>directly to</strong> them. Let me make it evidently clear to all, the names of these self-proclaimed <strong>False Prophets</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>RedChessQueen. Rensole. Hey_Madie.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I've come to deliver YOUR Endgame. Priority-mail shipped directly to your front door, with a complimentary side of these fuckin hands.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<h1>Intro -</h1>
<p>For the apes who find themselves reading this post, surprised or better said, <strong><em>unaware</em></strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong><em>the corruption,</em></strong> that reigns supreme within these so-called “mods” of Superstonk. This one is for every single one of you as well. You <strong><em>deserve the</em></strong> <strong>transparency that was promised but never delivered. The truth.</strong> </p>
<p>Today is my goal to do just that. If you’ve read my previous DD regarding ‘A Castle of Glass’, you’ll know that I make one thing evidently clear. Just as I did in that, <strong>I ask you</strong> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <strong>to believe my words, but instead, the</strong> <strong><em>evidence</em></strong> <strong>which backs them. Be critical. Be focused in your assessment of</strong> <strong><em>everything you’re about to see</em></strong><strong>, and only</strong> <strong><em>then</em></strong><strong>, do ask that you decide if what you’re about to see is the</strong> <strong><em>transparency you were promised.</em></strong>  </p>
<p>You’ll find me reference many other apes, as well as <em>direct conversations between mods</em> in the past. These guys fucked over <strong>a lot of good people</strong> in their disillusioned drive for power, and many of them were <strong>very willing to come out of the dark corners in which these scumbags shoved them into.</strong> Every source will be provided for your own verification. <strong>Right for the jugular then.</strong>  </p>
<h1>Part I - The "Queen"</h1>
<p>Have you apes wondered what really caused the first migration? I assure you, it wasn’t the misguided acts of “15-year-old children”, as likely as that sounds..right? On the contrary, to understand how it occurred, you must question who created the sub, to begin with. I’ll let this person tell you themselves though,</p>
<p>Here's the link to the video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRMnqN2sHDw&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRMnqN2sHDw&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>, you are more than welcome to see it all for yourself, but honestly, if you don't want to take a fuckin arrow to the knee and sit there for over an hour pausing every few seconds, I went through it all already and highlighted what I believed to be the key findings. (Someone should do it tho just so I can share the pain of it with lol) </p>
<p><strong>RedChessQueen (left), tiptoeintown Ex-mod (Right)</strong> </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/eetsjb9e9xb71.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a8c02ddc1e60d3aaf675f2950ee9fa6bd1a97ca</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you must understand is the time frame. These messages were provided by the latter Ex-Mod, dating back to roughly a week or so before <strong>the great migration occurred.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Next, and though you may already know it, you must recognize that SS was</strong> <strong><em>created by Red herself, for what she calls “contingencies”...</em></strong>pay <em>very</em> close attention to that part..it’s going to play a <strong>critical role in all this soon..</strong></li>
<li>Lastly, <strong>something you must become aware of</strong> <strong>now before we get further into this mess.</strong> To deduce how Red <strong><em>thinks,</em></strong> you must read through the lines and see how <strong>she</strong> <strong><em>writes and conveys her thoughts through her writing.</em></strong> </li>
<li>In doing so, you’ll catch more than just statements...but words that connote a '<strong>superiority complex' thought process.</strong> I point this out now, because though it may not make itself evident yet...<strong>it will become increasingly blatant, as we go along in defining</strong> <strong><em>one of her personas.</em></strong> <strong>Yes..there are multiple..we’ll get there.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>This screenshot is to highlight key points in which she reveals her cognitive approach. Pay keen attention to <em>how</em> she <strong><em>writes</em></strong> again.  </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/xsdii32w9xb71.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=653f5416785024653a11221d4f432a6ffc2d5d1e</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong><em>Trained for this”, “make allegiances with other elite people”</em></strong><strong>.</strong> The high horse is getting higher..<strong>what</strong> <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> <strong>are you trained for, Red?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Another key point</strong>, this provides a further highlight of the time period of the convo by her mentioning ‘<strong>Alexis Goldstein’s AMA’.  Further,</strong> <strong><em>note</em></strong> <strong>how she</strong> <strong><em>alludes</em></strong> <strong>to the already unstable ‘state of the sub’</strong> during that time frame. </li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong><em>it is critical that you do your best to not hold her statements about the state of the mods until AFTER you have read everything but instead do your best to keep what she is saying in mind. She is ACTIVELY pushing her cognitive agenda in many of the messages in an attempt to manipulate Tip.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you obviously can take it as such, but in due time, you’ll soon find out what I meant. Better to catch these things now though. </li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot depicts insight into the state of the GME’s last sub before it was getting ready to blow. This is a bit difficult to see, so zoom in, the <strong>focal point is the last statement.</strong> </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/4rzme0g2axb71.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb01ee6b0b03ffec69c76a387d6d47d950098cc7</p>
<ul>
<li>The above highlights are there to further emphasize the state of the sub (remember, <em>hold</em> these thoughts), which apes were provided with near <em>minimal</em> insight into <strong>until it blew up in our faces</strong>. </li>
<li>The bottom-most highlight is <strong>key to keep in mind. This is where we begin to see her true nature. She states the following to Tip:</strong> “<strong><em>I wouldn’t let anyone slander your name without evidence”</em></strong>...let’s see how that goes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skipping forward past a lot of talks that are irrelevant to the purpose of this post (again, I have the video linked, feel free to read it all if you’d like), we get to the point <strong>where their conversation takes a</strong> <strong><em>dramatic</em></strong> <strong>turn. This is towards the end of the video.</strong>   </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/tesnr6i7axb71.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1581e86e0e123d50c8421e0e97d360c0de37b640</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Now,</strong> <strong><em>this portion</em></strong> <strong>truly raised a lot of questions.</strong> <strong><em>We are provided no insight as to WHAT caused this outburst, and WHAT exactly Tip is referring to in her words against Red.</em></strong> </li>
<li>Here, it becomes <strong>very important</strong> that you recall during which timeframe this all was occurring. <strong>Every message prior to this was building</strong> <strong><em>up</em></strong> <strong>to the events of the great migration. I had my ideas about what she may have been referring to, but to know for sure, I directly contacted Tip to see if my deduction was correct.</strong> In doing so, I’m grateful that she was willing to show us <strong>the other side which was all too easily left out.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To maintain transparency, I’ve provided my opening message to her to provide context into how this conversation began. The following also provides a good idea of the type of questions and concerns I had regarding everything that I was finding out.  </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/l3anh2mbaxb71.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa095b6f122a6a031128254a7e1b494dc4a108a7</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>As we progress forward, the insight you’ll be seeing is provided <em>directly by Ex-mods</em>. These generous apes, who had been slandered by others with ill-intent, were willing to come forward with information that would begin to show how deep the rabbit hole of fuckery truly went. </li>
<li>This is evidently clear for all of you to see in <em>just the first response Tip would give me to my first question.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>As our conversation would begin to develop further, I would ask her the following in regard to the final moments of the screenshots she had provided in her video. <strong>The following question additionally provides insight into my own thoughts as to what may have happened, and Tip’s subsequent response to them.</strong> </p>
<p>Additionally, keep in mind that I asked this <strong><em>after</em></strong> taking into consideration <strong><em>all the messages revealed by Pink</em></strong>. Seeing as how RedChessQueen’s most recent outburst had led to Pink's <strong>perma-ban</strong> through <strong>blatant misconceptions and threats, I began to note similarities in events that had occurred in the past and those of last week. Her most recent outburst felt all too similar, to the type of reaction which Tip seemed to be referring to in her final message to Red, as shown earlier.</strong> It’ll make more sense here shortly as our conversation develops. </p>
<p><strong>Initial Question about the final moments of the chat log video made public by Tip:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“If you don't mind me asking, that conversation ends with you calling out Red and putting her on blast, but the details are left out. Now, if you wouldn't mind correcting me if I'm wrong, was this revolving around Red mistakenly, through her batshit crazy-ass, targeting Plum, which would lead towards (or occur around) the migration?</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Tip’s Response:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>“Your comment asking me to clarify about red is 150% spot on”</em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional details:</strong></p>
<p><img alt=" " src="https://preview.redd.it/svf552mjaxb71.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=104737f8147aad25c953f173ad7ffa10b9a2e4ac" /></p>
<ul>
<li>I’m going to have to ask you guys to read that one more time, just so we’re all <strong><em>really on the same page here.</em></strong></li>
<li>Now had I seen this before the screenshots brought to light by Pink or the fact the mods seemed incredibly suspect in <em>not letting my DD through for two days..(yeah there’s more..)</em> <strong><em>I’d still be pretty suspicious of their shit due to the irregularities over the past weeks</em></strong><strong>. Her response, though, verified my deduction down to the bone.</strong></li>
<li>Remember, you just read corroborated material regarding events that occurred <strong><em>months ago</em></strong> <strong>from a source</strong> <strong><em>directly involved in the whole fiasco.</em></strong> When you piece it together <strong>with RCQ’s</strong> <strong><em>most recent antics:</em></strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pinkcatsonacid/comments/ok85ds/so_called_transparency_and_mod_drama_i_will_share/"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/user/pinkcatsonacid/comments/ok85ds/so_called_transparency_and_mod_drama_i_will_share/</strong></a> <strong>you’ll begin to see what I was getting at.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For those that don’t want to read all that, here’s a single snippet into how absurd some of the things stated by Red were. You can’t make this shit up..</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/1l62zp8naxb71.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca8acb469f878dc613f72d85c3c1236de99e90fe</p>
<p>These are the words of one the mod <strong>who created superstonk, and until July 17th, reigned at the highest position (she's TaKiNg a BreAk 🤡)</strong><strong><em>. The same one who we now know was behind the entire coup that would lead to the removal of other mods who were completely blindsided and betrayed. The outcome? Getting apes to move to a sub SHE created as a “contingency”, for an outcome SHE herself had allowed to develop.</em></strong></p>
<p>As my conversation with Tip went on, she would explain to me how <strong><em>multiple other mods at the time</em></strong> would be manipulated into her grand scheme, allowing these events to occur as they did.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip would provide me further insight and evidence other ex-mods had saved. Evidence backing claims such as that <strong>Red had completely used and turned on them. The inner workings of the great migration would begin to reveal themselves even further through their insight as well.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an insight by one of these Ex-mods of our last sub, Chickthief. It is in this conversation that I ask every ape out there to pay careful attention to <strong><em>how RCQ speaks, compare her tone in this conversation, to that of what you’ve seen above</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/errc1w8taxb71.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbace42ab08f8c9d8b74b456742248dbc17ecc8d</p>
<ul>
<li>Form your deduction about every single word she uses, and how she uses them very carefully because that is <strong>precisely how she chose them for this situation. Very fuckin carefully.</strong> </li>
<li>Do you <em>see it?</em> <strong><em>This is some 6 fuckin D-level manipulation right here.</em></strong> Assess <strong><em>each word, and recall what I mentioned at the VERY beginning, “to deduce how Red thinks, you must read between the lines”</em></strong>. </li>
<li><strong>You’ll notice how her persona changes dramatically when speaking to a younger mod.</strong> She <em>knows</em> that she cannot approach this person the same way she has others, <strong><em>her verbiage is calculated.</em></strong> To cause such a substantial move as the first sub migration, she moved many pieces in her game of ‘chess’.  </li>
</ul>
<p>To get an overview of this, let’s put together everything in order that we’ve seen so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>She <strong><em>lies</em></strong> <em>to one ex-mod (Tip) about delivering critical intel, which</em> <strong><em>she herself had</em></strong> <em>asked Tip to gather for her so she could bring it forth to Plumdragon.</em> </li>
<li>She <em>willingly leaves out said critical information for the sole purpose of using it</em> <strong><em>against another mod completely unaware of this intel, to begin with. Done solely to place blame on them</em></strong> <em>for what was to come.(Plumdragon)</em></li>
<li><em>At the same time, she’s having</em> <strong><em>another conversation IN PARALLEL with Chick for the sole reason of manipulating him.</em></strong></li>
<li>All of this she does with the pretense of throwing <strong>every single one of them</strong> under the bus, shortly after. <strong>Remember the fuckin story about 15 yr olds TaKiNg DoWn ThE SuB, that was fed to us about what caused the migration? Yeah..ask yourself which of the two outcomes is more plausible now..</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>My conversation proceeding with Tip would enlighten me with even more insight, and this part is truly fascinating,</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/1gfsr7pyaxb71.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46d26f389e7069cede4228ef01693acb49dcb13e</p>
<p>Damn, now I’m no rocketist, but that's <strong>some good fuckin math if I’ve ever seen it.</strong> Scroll back up if you have to, read it all once more with this newfound perspective. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>This</em></strong> <strong>is the person running a sub of 500,000+ individuals,</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Who has full control of the addition of other suspect mods (Madie)</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Narrative</em></strong> <strong><em>control she has locked into place with Rensole’s role</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Not to mention the Satori system/Stonkbot which are also compromised.</em></strong> (hold this thought, as I’m going to extrapolate on it further after the following points) </li>
</ol>
<p>One more key thing we have to discuss here, and this is going to be some DiCaprio Inception level shit. I’m edging more on the side of hypotheticals here, but it is something <strong><em>we absolutely MUST consider</em></strong><strong>.</strong> This statement is coming from an ex-mod about something RCQ herself stated, now, although everything RCQ has said and done fits perfectly into this narrative, I ask you to ponder the following:</p>
<p><strong>Doesn’t it all seem too damn convenient? Almost as if she releases</strong> <strong><em>this</em></strong> <strong>kind of information to other mods to provide an excuse for her actions</strong> <strong><em>further</em></strong> <strong>down the road, you know,</strong> <strong><em>kind of like a “contingency”</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>That’s right. You</strong> <strong><em>need to consider this depth of thought process when analyzing how a potential, expert-level infiltrator would execute their actions</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I say this because everything we’ve seen here is so damn calculated, it almost seems <strong><em>too convenient</em></strong> <strong>for her to just state she’s been diagnosed with BD.</strong> </li>
<li>Furthermore, why would you let this information out, knowing the role you hold in moderating a community of <strong>hundreds of thousands of individuals</strong>? </li>
<li>People like this go through <strong>severe episodes of hyper-mania and/or hypomania with potential cycles of depression as well,</strong> depending on the type. </li>
<li>But the way Red executes her actions, functions as a perfect guise in case shit goes south. <strong>Now I’m not counting out the possibility that this is indeed the case for her, but this does not mean I’m not willing to</strong> <strong><em>consider</em></strong> <strong>this as a potentiality given the circumstances. Even if it were, that literally does not help her case.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I say <em>this</em> because when her outbursts have occurred, <strong>they somehow line up</strong> <strong><em>perfectly during critical junctures in time in regard to events related to GME.</em></strong> For a recent reference, take into consideration the events surrounding all the hype behind July 14th and the subsequent revelations which were brought to light by Pink. Fascinating, isn’t it? </p>
<p>To further validate everything explained above, check this response out by Plumdragon, whose comments I would find on the same Pinkcatsonacid thread I would first reveal my own concerns through. The following is a comment by Plum:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/ldlubbtcbxb71.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=894ca46c3e80532732229e637d982517da196bf4</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Plum would reply to one of my statements on this thread as well in offering insight regarding <strong>a shill account that had tried to invalidate the substantially evidence-based material</strong> <strong><em>I provided for all apes to see for themselves</em></strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong><em>deduce for themselves.</em></strong> This shill literally thinks I’m Pinkcatsonacid and uses this narrative to spread FUD, like...bruh. </p>
<p>I’m providing the screenshots to what I’m referring to (and links to the subsequent threads so anyone here can verify for themselves) below. You may ask <em>why</em> tf is this important? It's in this post to highlight the fact that this person is more or less acting on the <strong>behalf of the mods, and doing so in their defense at ANYTHING stated bad about them. This guy functions awfully similar to a personal guard from how he ALWAYS targets specific comments in an attempt to invalidate them.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>But here's the fuckin kicker...the first two posts are</strong> <strong><em>just</em></strong> <strong>from the last two days. Under most circumstances, I wouldn't give two fucks about sus accounts like this,</strong> <strong><em>but the fact that Plum recognized him so quickly...now that was intriguing.</em></strong> <strong>I followed up with plum about this guy and to my surprise, he’s done this</strong> <strong><em>exact same thing for months. Specifically targeting this Ex-mod in the EXACT same manner in the past, tracking their account anytime they posted whatsoever.</em></strong>  </p>
<p>The first link will provide you the thread in which they continued their endless tirade once more. <strong>Going as far as claiming</strong> <strong><em>me and Pink as one entity solely because I called them on their bullshit.</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>First link - This scumbags comments:</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pinkcatsonacid/comments/oktgqv/for_the_record_this_includes_a_warning_from_dr_t/h5beiic?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/user/pinkcatsonacid/comments/oktgqv/for_the_record_this_includes_a_warning_from_dr_t/h5beiic?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Second link - Plum's recognition of said scumbag:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Evidence of similar acts from months ago:</strong> </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/6dr7tc7jexb71.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fa9dea052dbfd6a2c72e9d3b455d6fde21a0620</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll be damned if I think <em>this</em> is a sheer coincidence. No, <strong><em>I’d argue, this is a calculated shill attack by an individual sent out to ‘clear’ the mod's name by spreading complete nonsense in a very technical manner...dating back as far as MONTHS ago.</em></strong> </li>
<li>You may question why I even chose to include this piece of information, but in doing so I ask that you take a step back and assess <strong>the lengths these shills are willing to go to assert their control.</strong> <strong><em>They do not exert their influence in any direct manner but instead send out their shit-riddled scum to execute actions which they themselves cannot afford to risk themselves.</em></strong>  </li>
<li>I'd argue, it seems all too similar to the tactics used by Wallstreet scum. you can damn near smell their shit from a mile away.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But there are bigger fish to fry than this shit-stained coward. Better said, there are bigger shits to flush before I'm done here.</strong> </p>
<h1>Part II - The "Anchor"</h1>
<p>This time though, the evidence I bring forth comes from none other than myself. In doing so. </p>
<p>To understand this, you must first <em>see for yourself,</em> <strong>the level of suppression I had the vehement displeasure of experiencing when attempting to get my Glass Castle DD onto Superstonk.</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oklf6e/reposting_after_i_had_deleted_my_original_post/h5911ip?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oklf6e/reposting_after_i_had_deleted_my_original_post/h5911ip?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</strong></a> </p>

<p><strong>Hey bud, where was this help when someone who actually</strong> <strong><em>gives a fuck</em></strong> <strong>about this sub needed it?</strong>  </p>
<p>Upon making this post evident, I had <strong>multiple apes bring to light even more evidence dating back to months ago about how Rensole was</strong> <strong><em>abusing his powers as a mod by banning those who disagreed, DELETING his own suspect comments, and playing dumb as if he had no idea what was going on</em></strong><strong>.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Please see FuckYouRen Exhibits A-C below.</strong> </p>

<p>Here’s you’ll find a response this douchenozzle had the audacity to send me in regard to the bs about <strong>why he let anon through. For anyone who took the time to read my post, first thank you, second, read his response and</strong> <strong><em>tell me this guy isn’t spitting pure bs. Anyone who read the OG anon’s post and truly recognized it would’ve seen the shill account was fake af. But somehow Rensole didn’t? Hell Nah.</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong>The fuckin Audacity boy. The fuckin Audacity...</strong></p>
<p><strong>The thing is the level of suppression on</strong> <strong><em>such a massive scale...can ONLY be executed through the use of a system capable of regulating thousands of posts and comments simultaneously. A job no single mod can do...but a programmed system...now that is suppression, realized.</em></strong>  </p>
<h1>Part III - The "System" &amp; The Shill</h1>
<h1>Here's an excellent breakdown by an ape that explains what I'm getting at, but also leads us to the next head on the chopping block. Madie, who in the cinnamon toast fuck do you think you are?</h1>

<p>So, you're telling me that our good ole trustable, never to lie RCQ allowed this person access to moderator level control, <strong>yet almost no one knew.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, this mod <strong><em>had access to files pertaining to the 'SySteM MeAnT To PrOtEcT aPeS fRoM ShIlLs?"</em></strong> </p>
<p>This <strong>same mod who posted this steaming hot pile of FUD-riddled garbage?</strong> </p>

<p>Oh...and trust me, <strong>I sure as fuck didn't forget about this so-called 'Satori mod team'. Like hotcakes, that's how I'm flipping these stones.</strong> This is just a snippet, you seriously have to click this link and see what this fuckin certified tip-nibbling heads GrUnGGrOmP is going to refuse <strong>any valid verification that Madie or Red didn't have access to Satori. That ape below though,</strong> <strong><em>lights this fuckboy up.</em></strong> <strong>Seriously, grab some popcorn for this one.</strong> </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/2ljejpn3oxb71.png?width=408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4aa341fed9c7003f62792ad5d5212313418bb5f</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olimp5/important_and_needs_to_be_seen/h5f5c17?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olimp5/important_and_needs_to_be_seen/h5f5c17?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>But wait, you didn't think I'd leave out the <strong>ape's own</strong> <strong><em>experiences, did you?</em></strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/g683tskfnxb71.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd506c94a1fb4e4e2fd924cace2df937d9d03ce</p>
<p><strong>Holy fuck. If you made it here, Tendie Lord blesses your soul. There it is. The transparency you asked for. The truth that was promised, but never delivered. Apes, this is the reality of these people that claim to run Superstonk. Their</strong> <strong><em>true identities. Their true natures.</em></strong> <strong>But to say that I did this to</strong> <strong><em>solely</em></strong> <strong>expose these collective bag of dicks, would be dishonesty from my end.</strong> </p>
<p>Though it may have been where it all started, I never had the intention of going this deep into this shitstorm. But sometimes, you see things that you simply cannot <strong>unsee. You see things that cannot be undone.</strong> </p>
<p>And what do I see? <strong>I believe that RCQ, Rensole, and Madie were part of this plan</strong> <strong><em>all along</em></strong><strong>. I'd argue, that the question of whether RCQ</strong> <strong><em>gave Madie access to Satori, was never even discussed between them. I'd argue, that these scumbags, have had this intent ready and planned out MONTHS ahead of time. Every. Single. Fucking. Step of it.</em></strong> </p>
<p>Now you should be asking <strong><em>why?</em></strong> And to that, I <strong>encourage you apes to read even a</strong> <strong><em>part</em></strong> <strong>of the following DD dating back months ago.</strong> I purposely saved this one for the end, because <strong>biases, can lead to mistakes.</strong> But <strong>revelations were revealed</strong> <strong><em>after the fact..now those are hard to argue.</em></strong> After everything is brought to light <strong><em>how deep, do you think this rabbit hole TRULY goes?</em></strong> <strong>Click the link, and find out.</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mtyk40/superstonk_is_sus_an_investigation_into/"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mtyk40/superstonk_is_sus_an_investigation_into/</strong></a></p>
<h1>Conclusion -</h1>
<p><strong>I may have been frustrated, even mad when I discovered how far these scumbags went in suppressing my DD, but you know what</strong> <strong><em>really pushed me over the edge?</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Reading this.</strong> </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/0ioju8u3txb71.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed025909a172683089fdfd1d90ef4473a5669b0e</p>
<p><strong>These same people who once safeguarded us were thrown into the gauntlet, betrayed. Just like you and I was betrayed. Every single ape out there,</strong> <strong><em>including these individuals who once held the line with us, deserved better</em></strong><strong>.</strong> </p>
<p>I'm willing to bet my shares of GME, that there are countless apes out there reading this now, who recognize Tip's words, all too well. I may have been pissed before this conversation, but after reading these words, and seeing the pain which dwelled within them. <strong>I was out for fucking blood, and blood, I have delivered.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The rest is up to each and every single,</strong> <strong><em>individual, one of you</em></strong> <strong>to decide what you believe in. Yes, a sub is lost, but out of it I ask you the following,</strong></p>
<p><strong>What did you</strong> <strong><em>learn? How much did you deduce about how far these scum are willing to go? Their tactics, their ploys, their drives, and everything in between?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Even more than this, did</strong> <strong><em>you see it? Did you</em></strong> <strong>see</strong> <strong><em>how much do they fear the inevitable?</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong><em>To go as far as infiltrating online user forms, creating fake accounts to discredit user posts, utilizing EVERY single method of fuckery they can conceive up in the process. What did they truly accomplish?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I'd argue, that they only further strengthened every single, individual, ape's resolve to hold.</em></strong> <strong>They fucked up the moment they thought their</strong> <strong>power to be</strong> <strong><em>absolute.</em></strong> <strong>You see, these scum that riddled these subs, are no different than the scum's living in The</strong> <strong><em>Castle of Glass.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>When the tendies flow, and rest fuckin assured they</strong> <strong><em>will flow,</em></strong> <strong>each and every single one of you apes will remember one thing when it all happens.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>It was never</strong> <strong>just</strong> <strong>about the money</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>the change. It was all about what it took to get there.</strong> <strong><em>That...is the true purpose of standing for something greater than any single one of us, could ever become.</em></strong> </p>
<p>So, like my dad always says, <strong><em>buckle the fuck up kiddo, we're goin' to the moon.</em></strong>  <strong>🚀</strong></p>
