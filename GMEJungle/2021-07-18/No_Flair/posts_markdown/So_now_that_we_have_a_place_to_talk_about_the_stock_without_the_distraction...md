# Title: So now that we have a place to talk about the stock without the distractions, can we get back on track about the fact that more than the available float just expired in one single options contract?

The recent filing stated that the share withstanding equal 69,000,000-ish and that institutions hold 39,000,000-ish of those shares leaving 30,000,000-ish available, NOT ACOUNTING for those held by GameStop leaders.... So it should be even lower than 30M. 

Yet somehow a SINGLE options contract just expired on Friday that accounted for 40,000,000-ish shares...  This ALONE is all the evidence we need to know we are correct and we are winning and we own the fucking float.. 

Just Buy and Hodl. Everything else is entertainment.
