At first I noticed the good: better posts, less shills (or so I thought at the beginning).

Then I noticed a shift: I wasn't getting approved, but dozens of users with less karma and age then me were actively commenting and some even spreading negative messages.

That's when it all started making me angry and frustrated.

And now I find out that I wasn't alone!

So to all you lurkers and silenced apes, I see you!

And I can finally say in all confidence BUY AND HODL!
