Let's keep it short and sweet. 60k migrated here already, not bad at all. 

So Warden, Renshill, now Red. All of them had their loyal fanbases. Red used to refer to herself as our Queen. FOH, I don't know you and apparently you have serious mental issues so I'm glad I don't.

GME subs are a way to pool info and get relevant updates in what our favorite stock is doing, but at this point the DD is done. I'm not here to make friends with internet strangers, find a wife or become master of a forum. 

All apes are equal, so there's absolutely no reason for even "good mods" and contributors like atobitt, criand, dlauer, diamantehands guy, Hank and of course pink here to have people jerking them off every time they post something. If their content is good, say the post is good, not the person. You don't know them, they might be fucking crazy like red. Too many times you see users commenting on what a genius the writer is, how lucky we are to have them, how thankful we should be that they exist and live on this Earth to help poor dumb apes see the light, people printing and framing DD, ffs... Just be normal guys.

TLDR; I don't know any of you nor do I want to. The DD is done, buy and hodl. And please do not be cringey and worship redditors, this internet shit isn't real. Back to lurking.
