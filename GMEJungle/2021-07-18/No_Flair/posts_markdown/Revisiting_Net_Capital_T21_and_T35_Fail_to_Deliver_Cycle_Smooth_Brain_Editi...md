Most of you guys don‚Äôt know me, but amongst the dumpster fire of Reddit this week, I think there is something crucial we need to talk about. 

And instead of having somebody who knows what they are doing talk about it, this is  
Net Capital, and Fail To Deliver cycles: Smooth üß† Edition

Shoutout to u/Criand for being one of the coolest MF‚Äôs on Reddit. I‚Äôm a huge fan and I hope I don‚Äôt fuck this up. If I do, please tell me and make my day. I‚Äôm serious. I want to be able to tell people that you told me I was full of shit.  Moving on

This is Criand‚Äôs Net Capital Cycle from a few weeks back.  What‚Äôs I find interesting is that as  June 24th passed without a rise in share price, it seemed like we‚Äôve lost excitement over this cycle. 

Again, I hope I‚Äôm understand correctly, but the share offering that GameStop conducted most recently could have bailed the SHF out on this past T+21 cycle. That means that the theory still holds as true as ever, but that it was just pushed back due to the share offering. 

I also think that it‚Äôs worth noting that the share offering was just a drop in the bucket compared to the estimated SI%

All of this leads to the fact our next T+21 day cycle happens on July 26th, or the Monday after this next week. 

Now, I‚Äôm going to let you in on a secret, I LOVE DATES 

Dates are the shit, and nobody can tell me otherwise. As long as mods are busy with their dumpster fire I will continue to rant about dates.

The only think I like more then Dates is dates that either overlap, or run together. That‚Äôs the ENTIRE reason I made this smooth brain post that has been about 99% opinionated, because I am too lazy to source facts and provide them to you. I‚Äôm very possibly full of shit, but I told you that.

Check this shit out.

Somebody has 462,852 Fail to Delivers that went on paper for June 18th. Can anybody guess what 35 calendar days from June 18th is? 

You guessed it! Frida_

NO YOU SMOOTH BRAIN

THINK APE THINK

4th of July being a Sunday this year means that we observed Independence Day on July 5th, as you probably remember the markets being closed.

This means that if I‚Äôm not a complete idiot who has completely misinterpreted DD on this sub, and twisted it into my own crazy fan fiction, we have something to look forward to on July 26th. 


With all of that said, if you made it this far, I can almost guarantee you are bored AF and just looking for some complimentary stock information.

Have a good weekend apes, turn your phone off and go get laid before you get rich and can‚Äôt trust anybody.  That‚Äôs my advice for
this weekend.  I will now conclude with a famous quote from our sub


‚ÄúDear SHF, 

Fuck you, pay me.‚Äù
