First off, not financial advise. Not even regular advise. Just a guy who likes doing his own research finally being able to get broader feedback now there are less karma requirements. Anyway here's a TLDR, I like the stock, I don't like the market. The market is running out of places to park money and the government has other issues on it's mind. Everyone blindly running into each other. GME positions will show massive returns when an overall market correction inevitably takes place.

Also this was made 1 week ago, I'm working on a more current and thorough piece, will share if people care <3.

**Thesis**

The GameStop stock is representative of the market as an inverse bet. The Market is extremely overvalued with a giant speculative bubble arising out of it. The Fed, Market Makers, and Average everyday people have reached a point in which financial risk and reward needs to be honestly accounted for. The actions taken over the last 2 years have been extremely foolish and we are about to enter a period of great deleveraging. However, since the 2008 crash was never honestly accounted for, we may expect to see another bailout. This will be impossible since the Fed will be all but bankrupt coming at the end of quarter 3 and start of quarter 4.

**Introduction**

This DD has been slowly formed, in order to, privately, see potential dates on MOASS. However this information contained in this prediction may have more insights on the larger market sentiment and possibly the entire global economy. Let me start by saying this isn’t a doomsday prediction. In order for there to be a doomsday for everyone would have to lose faith in the dollar, and for that to happen each asset of America, (citizens represent assets as they can work to produce) would have to be assumed to be worthless. What is far more likely is a period of hyperinflation and great deleveraging. Obviously this is not ideal either and can be more uncomfortable the further the financial food chain you move down. The idea that gives the government comfort is that they can guarantee the riskiest assets in order to prevent big financial institutions collapsing all at once. Let’s go back and take a look at some other financial crises and pinpoint some overlapping themes that can give us insight on today.

**Background**

Anyone familiar with the financial world and its history knows bubbles aren’t rare and happen often. The first financial crisis, panic, or speculative bubble we acknowledge, is the 1637 Dutch tulip crisis. So let’s dive in and take a closer look at it.

\-1637 Dutch Tulip Bubble

Yes the idea that a single bulb of flower could buy its own weight in gold is ridiculous, but markets are prone to overvaluation and bubbles. This event however was the birth of the credit derivative of futures. The story goes that the wealthy would show off their wealth by buying rare Commodities from all over the world. The Dutch people themselves have been going through a great deal of economic boom due to their vastly expansive Trade Network. Now in this time they were trading things all over the world including sugar, spices, and slaves and these things made the Dutch wealthy, really wealthy. And what do you do when you have a lot of money? You have to spend it on things that show you have wealth and one of the main things that people really loved was a newly imported flower, the tulip. Since these flowers were very beautiful, people wanted to have a lot of them in their Gardens and Lawns to make their entire house look prettier so the prices of tulip bulbs slowly rose. This means if you were a tulip farmer, you could make a pretty good living and have a pretty stable market of buyers because tulips don't actually live that long. The average tulip lives about three years and produces about two to three offspring. Aside from this you can clone the bulbs, but that can only be done a limited amount of times before you kill them. So you can expect to get out of 1 Tulip, around 4 tulips. so the market had a way of regulating itself in which the total supply of tulips was somewhat curved based on the plant's difficulty to be bred.  However not every tulip was the same and there was one specific tulip that had a virus to it but a consequence of the virus was getting a very beautiful pattern. This virus would change the color of the Tulip to a very rare shade that couldn't be replicated by normal means. What's more, these rare tulips did not birth other rare tulips and couldn't be cloned either. So now there was a market for tulips, rare tulips, and as a consequence potential rare tulips. A single tulip Speculator could now buy a whole field of tulips, hoping to get a few of the rare tulips that would end up paying for the entire field and then some. But now we get into the tricky market of tulips. The thing is the flower only blooms in April, May, and June. The other months while the plant is still alive it is dormant. During the dormant phase is when you can actually clone the Tulip and move the tulip. If you moved the Tulip while it was blooming it would most certainly die. So with such a limited window to breed and create more of the same product, tulip Prospectors had to make sure to sell their product before it bloomed. So now a lot of people are making money off of tulips, and this really marks the first time of the creation of the middle class. But since everybody didn't want to miss out on the money to make, the price of tulips soared above what could ever be considered a real price and entered a bubble price. Now this bubble price didn't last very long, about two months before the Tulips were to blossom, in February of 1637, the 1st bad news about the Tulip future Market broke. Not one person had shown up to the Tulip contract auction for the first time ever. Which was absolutely insane considering the day before, the place was packed. It seemed that overnight the entire Market changed its mind. Prices of tulips crashed, people threw away or burned their tulip futures contracts, and in one case a famous author changed his name from Dutch word for tulip.

**Relevance**

There are many things to learn from this story and the reason I chose it was because of how simple the commodity was. The attractive thing about tulip investing was the fact that everyone was doing it. Money was pouring into the market which caused people to feel safer taking more and more speculative bets. As the market for tulips ballooned,  the price of a tulip left the realm of intrinsic value. So what does this have to do with today’s markets? Well according to many sources we are living in a period of great market overvaluation. The Buffet indicator is 2.9 standard deviations above what might be considered “normal levels.” This indicates that we are greatly overvaluing the markets. So why is no one freaking out about this? Well essentially the theory is that as long as interest rates stay low, which they are at record lows, the economy can afford any correction that happens. They believe that there is enough liquidity and lines of credit that can be offered to weather any storm. This, is utterly stupid. The Fed has artificially pushed the interest rates low so homeowners and other borrowers could afford to make payments during a serious downturn in economic activity. It’s true we are “returning to normal” but the market needs to be honest with what happened. The economy is weak, so we lowered interest rates to allow people to pretend it has strength. This is all well and good, but just because the Fed changed the interest rates, doesn’t mean the economy turned around. So now we have an odd situation where the market is strongly overvalued, and the market sentiment is strongly overvalued, but the interest rates and rest of the financial system does not reflect those beliefs. So we have a bunch of financial risk and surplus of liquidity that begs to be honestly accounted for. So if the market makers realize what’s happening, we may see a complete halting of buying, and a massive sell off.

**Overleveraged**

Historically, banks leveraged themselves about 12:1. This was an accepted practice, but when left on their own, the banks leveraged themselves to shit. Bear Stearns, who managed $18 billion in assets, were leveraged about 33:1. Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers were 28:1, with the former being bought for pennies while the latter collapsed. The big kid on the playground, Goldman Sachs, also screwed themselves at 32:1. So where is Citadel? The largest market maker and big brother to every financial institution? Well trying to find a reliable answer  is difficult and reading a financial report from a financial institution melts brain cells. We have some rough numbers from investigations made by congress. Citadel reportedly controls about $35 billion in client cash. But when asked about the valuation of the assets under management, the number was above $234 billion. This cash cow is even more lucrative than the hedge fund he manages. It raked in cash and propelled him up about 100 spots on the richest people list. Surely such a big company wouldn’t dare even approach the 12:1 limit for banking institutions. They sit at a modest 9:1. But if there was one bet that you could always win, it is the assumption that a wall street firm is hiding risk. **We know big banks and hedge funds have a thousand ways to dance around financial laws. But some loopholes are easy and legal.** Behold the mother of all bank bailouts, the Federal Reserve. Anyone who is involved with the bond market, wall street, and by extension Reddit investors, knows the Reverse Repo Market has been hitting historic highs.

**Reverse Repos :(**

&#x200B;

Why any Bank would work out this deal with the Fed is beyond me. The Banks all have reserve accounts with the Fed, in this way the Fed is the Banks’ bank. In this account currently, excess cash placed in Bank Reserve accounts are being paid 15 basis points or .15%. Relatively low in the last few years where it was around 80 basis points. What is the rate of return of reverse repos? 5 basis points...05%. **The Big Banks like Goldman, Deutsche, and our favorite Citadel, are going out of their way, to take 10 less basis points just to do reverse repos with the Fed.** The question is why? We know these financial institutions will literally do anything to make money. And here they are just letting go of .10% interest rate profits on money they are parking. **IF THE MONEY IS IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT IT IS EXCESS CASH FOR A BANK, WHY DO THEY NEED TO PARK IT FOR LESS MONEY?**

*Side note: The Fed decided to undo literally everything it did in Quantitative Easing over the last 12 months in one night.* ***That's approximately $120 billion dollars a month of QE, undone, in one week.*** *This is a big change from how the Fed had been acting in years past. Usually they draw money from the financial system by Quantitative Tightening. So why is the Fed so desperate to flood themselves with cash? The imminent debt ceiling.*

**A Political System**

The debt ceiling is a political weapon designed by congress to make congress even more politically powerful. The original theory is nice in which congress proposes a budget that includes a maximum amount of money the federal government can borrow, and the president signs it into law. However, the spending side of the budget usually far outweighs the amount of money the federal government has. Thus they basically said borrow the rest. However the debt ceiling does not have to correlate with the budget. **The Federal Government has to by law, spend the money outlined in the budget as it is outlined, but not exceed its own debt limit despite what the budget might dictate.** So what is going to happen? The debt ceiling gets hit on 7/31/2021. This comes off an average of $50 billion dollars a week to run the U.S. government. **Congress breaks for recess for the entire month of August.** And no new debt can be issued until they reach an agreement for a new budget. The earliest this vote can be called? **September 15th.** So big financial institutions are more than happy to grab up every piece of treasury bond that falls out of the fed. Why? These assets are AAA investments, basically guaranteed money. The Fed get’s cash flow to keep itself running, and the banks get to bury their risks in treasury notes. 

Now this would all be an easy answer to why the bank and the Fed are acting this way. But unfortunately this answer is much too simplistic. One look at the Fed’s data on who is doing these reverse repos.

 

https://preview.redd.it/ukmzbc6q91c71.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9118ccb8aedcd1913e6445f8f0b4ab8df92651cd

Little difficult to see but, Money Market Funds are the majority of participants in the reverse repo market.

*Side note, for some reason the media has chosen to ignore this fact and focus on the participation of big banks such as Wells Fargo*

I am not known for my deep knowledge of why MMFs’ would be using the reverse repo market. But what this does indicate, is that MMFs’ are moving their money into the safest assets possible. **Let me say that again, Money Market Funds are moving their large piles of cash from the liability portion of the balance sheet of Wall Street, to the Federal Reserve.** Now there isn’t a whole lot of explanation as to why they would do this. The first idea is that they are Re-selling these Treasury Bonds at a lower rate and pocketing the spread. But I don’t really know if it is the job of MMFs to nickel and dime interest rates on T-bonds. However the larger repo market is much bigger than the nearly 1 trillion dollars of business being done with the Fed. **The larger Reverse Repo Market runs at about 4 trillion dollars every night.** This could be the answer or things are a bit more rough.

Objectively, moving assets from riskier investments to T-bonds is seen as bearish sentiment. The fact that we are coming off a global shutdown of the way we have done business since...Capitalism, would be an understanding reason for bearish sentiment.  But bearishness isn’t clear enough to me. I’d more believe that we are going to experience massive consequences from EVERYONE’s choices. Imagine 3 baseball players, one the government, another the banks, and the third everyday people, were chasing the same pop fly and are about to run into each other. Explanation on this later.

**Too Much Money, Nowhere to Hide it**

In spring of 2020, the federal government created $3 trillion dollars worth of new debt to stimulate the bailout programs they put into place. In order to flood the market with this cash, they inversely bought another $3 trillion in various assets and securities. This didn’t really fix the problem though. The problem we are facing in our global financial system is an excess of risk not sufficiently diffused, and money tied up in speculative assets. For example the jump in purchases of cryptocurrency is a great indicator of market bubbles. The reason why so many people have crypto is solely because of the low threshold for entry. Investing has rapidly changed in the last few years, as apps like Robinhood and Coinbase have opened a lot of capital up by lowering the barrier of entry for trading. This means much more money could come into the market, and therefore more business for market makers. Obviously this has been enormously powerful. But it created one big problem, most people will invest solely out of FOMO, rather than do research. This in turn creates many tulip markets.

*Side note: I’m not saying all small investors don’t research. However I believe that everyone should invest like they could only pick 10 assets to invest in ever. This means everyone would spend enormous amounts of time researching their selections. But as the old adage goes, as soon as the shoe shine boy gives you stock advice, it’s time to leave the market.* 

But cryptocurrency is not the only space that occupies the speculation. Recently a lot of money has been coming from both retail and wall street in investing in SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies. These companies price their stock at a modest $10 to try to entice investors to spread the risk. The sole purpose of these companies is to acquire a smaller company and make investors money. Normally these are decent investments with modest risk. However with the demand for new investments, people have begun investing in SPACs that don’t even have a stated purpose or field they are looking to acquire in. A great example of this, is the Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp. II. This corporation was founded in 2020 with a cute little website that offers absolutely no information about their plans. They calmly explain that they will target businesses, and leverage themselves safely, however since its inception, it quietly ate investors' money till it out of nowhere acquired PAYSAFE, another Nevada company. This new trend of skipping IPO and using a SPAC is pretty well received. I also feel the SPAC method is cleaner than an IPO price gouge. However since it is a new market, investors flooded in and feel safe investing in companies with no cash flow or business plans. Even SoFi, the new biggest holder of student loan debt, went public after their scandal using one of Palihapitiya’s SPACs. This new publicly traded company, now decided it is safer to take on way more risk, since the risk had been passed to the shareholders rather than the original investors. They created 1.4 trillion dollars in credit card debt with their brand new demographic, fresh college graduates that need to refinance their loans. **That’s right, SoFi is handing out credit cards to their very same clients they know can’t afford to make their student loan payments.** 

*Somewhere out there someone has the data of how much SoFi student loan debt is being paid by SoFi credit cards.*

The point being that these SPACs are still a new market. I’m not saying they aren’t trustworthy, but usually Wall Street takes a good idea and turns it into a complete shit show. Mortgage Backed Securities, credit cards, value at risk models, free checking (fucking scam), Enron’s weather futures,  and countless other ideas that were either taken too far or a blatant scam. So why should SPACs start any differently? Look up any list of SPACs today and try to find a transparent one.

We have seen real estate prices soaring even though we are going through a recession. Of course real estate is a strong investment in which if interest rates rise, your mortgage, assuming a fixed rate, will actually be a better investment as you are still paying low premiums and your house value rises. House prices also do well in recessions since the cost of building goes up so already built houses sell better. But 2020 was an extremely unusual year. We saw delinquency rates on mortgage loans reach 8.82% at their worst and have been fluctuating from about 6.5-8% since. Obviously these numbers are on the low end due to stimulus checks and other government aid. The cost of this is printed money flooding the mortgage market. On top of this, in the third quarter of 2020, mortgage originations hit 4 million, the highest rates since the  Great Recession. Home Mortgage loans were at an average of $295,000 which is $10,000 higher than 2019, and they continue to rise. **Even after the tumultuous year the market had in 2020, banks had no problem creating 4.3 trillion dollars in new mortgage debt, about 2.8 trillion in refinancing, and the rest in new purchasing loans.** 

**So the Government stepped in to help people pay their mortgages so they wouldn’t go homeless. And in order to continue to keep their bottom line during the covid crisis, banks took advantage of the low interest rates and issued record amounts of debt.**

Now it is important to keep in mind that for the most part, these are fixed rate loans. The loanees know how much they are going to pay but the problem now reaches the next part of a market bubble. Inflation. Everyone has a lot of cash, but no place to keep it safely.

**Weimar Republic 2.0**

Never concerned myself with understanding the large global fluctuations that move the market. However even when looking at the base levels of our markets, we can see a lot of companies are above their intrinsic valuations. What’s worse, is that Cryptocurrency and so called “meme” stocks are the center of the conversation. In a very real way, the market is using the “meme” stocks as a way of explaining the overvaluation. Since most people who haven’t done their DD, GME seems like a wild card bet that surely should fall back down to it’s “proper” price. However GME to me, represents a bet against the very market it is a part of. People don’t like to keep their money as cash. Warren Buffet has 34% of Berkshire Hathaway’s assets as cash, and he even expressed his sadness about this. In his own words, he described how it is difficult to find a company that is not overvalued right now. The consequence is keeping his money sidelined until he finds a decent investment. He is famous for overpaying so even if he found one, a reasonable price is unrealistic. 

*Side note, I am not saying GME is overvalued, quite the opposite. You all know the important things about how well this company is placed. 2 billion in raised cash, Top tier executives angling for a rapid market expansion, and a strong foundation of investors ready to hold the stock even if it hit $0.01. In a way GME is recession proof due to its strong investor base made up of “dumb money”.*

The point being nobody in their right minds knows what is going on with the markets. It honestly seems the only thing keeping the machine going is that nobody wants to believe it. We have been printing money and shoving it into banks and money markets to prop up a system that should’ve capsized in 2008. We never paid for this, sure working class people lost their jobs and homes, but we never actually paid. We just started printing money and placing it in banks. Once we had printed enough money where the banks wouldn’t go insolvent, the Treasury stepped in and sold them ungodly amounts of debt. The banks took this freebie and ran with it. They began starting up their toxic machine with one big change. The money the federal government printed for the banks required liquidity, isn’t technically real. In fact they couldn’t touch it at all so the money never ran through the economy. It solely existed on paper and this gave investors reassurance. We picked right back up and our markets soared for a decade. So where does this come back to us. Everywhere. If this thesis proves true, we can see the price of the dollar take a dramatic hit. All types of markets with investments will take losses as people panic and sell everything. The large amount of money that is liquidity will probably push inflation even further, and we may see the closure of Wall Street and the Markets for a few days. What this would be is Asset Deflation at the same time as Cash Inflation. The Dollar would only gain power if the Supply dropped faster than the demand, in this case the supply is ungodly and no one wants it. But the market is overvalued so if it drops it will really drop.

Here’s a graph of the assets vs liabilities of the Fed over the last 10 years.

Basic math tells us that the Fed is overleveraged.

**In Summation**

In my opinion, the current financial system is being propped up by the idea that the Fed has everything under control. In the last year, we have seen every country with a currency print trillions of bills to flood their economies. We didn’t panic because it was a necessity for the system. But no businesses were open, most people did not work. The money never ran through the system so we didn’t experience any inflation. In the United States alone, we printed so much money you could compare us to the Weimar Republic or the Mongols back in the 1300s. The events correlate perfectly with the German story as well. Civil unrest met with large amounts of cash. New retail investors flooded the market and new markets had to be created to find new ways to make money. Crime rose steadily and houses began foreclosure despite prices being on the rise. Today in the U.S., we sit at about 6.65% default rates on mortgage loans. This number is sure to go up as the Federal Mortgage Forbearance ended on Jun 30, 2021. The Eviction Moratorium ends Jul 31, 2021 and over 7 million Americans owe back rent. In May, Cryptocurrency lost 47% of its total market value in 1 week.📷

*Infographic to depict an Inverse ETF against its benchmark.*

What’s more we are seeing more purchases in large volumes of Inverse ETFs such as ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ, ProShares Short Ultrashort S&P500, and the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury. These Inverse ETFs provide returns if the underlying benchmark, the things it is being measured against, declines in value. Basically “smart money” is starting to bet against the NASDAQ ( ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ), the S&P 500 (ProShares Short Ultrashort S&P500), and even the U.S. Treasury Bonds (ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury). Normally these assets are purchased as hedges against market decline. But they also serve a higher purpose. These derivatives give us more insight into market sentiment and it's not good. These ETFs are being traded at large volumes periodically. You normally don’t hold these assets for long as the price resets everyday to mirror the market. However it seems either these ETFs are being purchased at either significant or relevant dates, or large rises in call options for them. **This is bearish**. We may see a massive deleveraging in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2021. Luckily, this is good news for apes. The reason stocks that are normally good fall during a crash, is general market panic and sell offs. Apes staying unified and holding stocks will create buy pressure in the algorithm. If the stock even maintains itself during the initial drop, all short sellers will be forced to close their positions on the riskiest trades, which surely naked shorting a stock 140% is near the top. It doesn’t even have to be all, one firm panicking or even better yet, being margin called, will trigger the upward spiral and one by one everyone holding GME stock to the ground with a rope will let go and watch it propel into the outer atmosphere. GME is my inverse ETF, the chosen bet of those who seek to change the fundamentals of a system that has become an uncontrollable behemoth.
