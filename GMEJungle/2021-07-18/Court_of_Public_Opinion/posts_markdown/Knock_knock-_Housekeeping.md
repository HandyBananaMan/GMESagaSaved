Alright let's get to fuckin work. üí™

&#x200B;

**You're not here to follow me. Don't worry I have no delusions about that**. You're here to follow an ideal that everything happening is bullshit in the stock market and otherwise, and also WE LIKE THE STOCK $GME. So let's get to it.

![Welcome to the Jungle BBs](https://preview.redd.it/qw1kith7gzb71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=988292ab6d91713859a150448b5b13e29408fce4)

First things first: I will address once again that this sub was created by me in early April, before becoming a mod of Superstonk. I thought I'd give it a shot as a daily GME poster. And it was in talking to a respected DDer from the community about a removed DD post on Superstonk (later reapproved manually after some outcry but we both thought fuckery might be afoot) that made me want to start a safe sub. I actually invited him to share his fresh DD there (here... whatever) and subsequently kind of abandoned the project because I quickly realized what a fuckin feat it is to create an entire subreddit from scratch. About 2 or less weeks later I was offered the mod position over there, and the rest is history. No I did not set this sub up as some sort of trap or backup plan. I was just a shitposter thinking about making a wild GME meme sub. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's really not that deep I promise.

&#x200B;

I will say, about a month ago I think? I offered modship, equal to their current permissions on Superstonk, to everyone on the mod team on this sub as a sort of backup plan, as we were being asked to provide (outside of twitter). Only a few accepted the invite at that time (not R or R) and the idea was basically shut down. The sub remained untouched, save a few posts from some randoms who found it through my profile, I assume. When everything started happening, everyone started asking where to go and I was wondering that myself after being handed a permaban from the other place. So into the jungle I went, and all you brilliant beautiful fuckers came here too. Here we are.

&#x200B;

Also I have officially dubbed myself the Groundskeeper Willie of this here Jungle. That's all I want to be. I'm not your queen or princess or whatever. I'm not on a pedestal. I'm your half lit, rowdy groundskeeper picking up your shit flinging. ü§ó

&#x200B;

So with that out of the way, let's get to work. üî®

&#x200B;

**Halp**

I need halp, and I have been told to surround myself with people that both I and the community trust. Having said that, I am putting forth u/BodySurfDan. I know dan from around the community for months, we met at the share holder meeting after both going through our own hellish road trips to get there, and he was at that time, supposed to be announced as a mod of Superstonk. That offer was rescinded and things fell apart. The way dan handled that was something that made me respect him even more, because he took it in stride and took no offense, even though the way it was delivered was pretty offensive. Anyway, I won't bring old drama here. I just want to put it forth for discussion today, a comment period of sorts, to get the ball rolling of adding a few trusted members. I need help.

&#x200B;

~~I will sticky a comment from BSDan to this post to allow for the comment period and discussion from you apes.~~ [Dan made a vetting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/omvrjv/at_the_request_of_apes_a_little_bit_about_myself/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Please comment on it!

I look forward to implementing this new democratic process in bringing in vetted members from the community help keep the place groovy.

&#x200B;

**Bans**

The community has always been good at picking out and tagging potential shills and tagging me for action. So I would largely like to leave the picking of shills out to the apes, as I have no time to shill hunt. **I will actively be banning users who are known FUD spreaders and meltdowners according to reports I've already received, but I'm not seeking anyone out and will largely just be answering to community requests (with obvious supporting evidence) to ban. (I will be banning 3 mods from the other forum to prevent them coming here to harass- rensole, madie, and redchessqueen99.)** I hope this helps to serve the idea that I'm just the button pusher for you apes here, and I don't plan to act with a heavy hand at all, I can't right now anyway.

&#x200B;

**Automod req's**

I'm figuring out automod and right now have (attempted to) set it to 15 days, 10 comment karma as a requirement to post. This is basically the bare minimum to keep out spammers and trash. I would like to up these requirements, but only to something basic like 30 days and 50 comment karma. I don't want to exclude any lurkers as it's OBVIOUS there's been a huge part of the membership silenced by SATORI and automod req's. I don't wish to silence anyone. YOU will largely be responsible for silencing shills with your downvotes. This is how we will moderate the sub for the time being, and I feel once the craziness dies down it might actually be a really effective form of democracy until we can build what we'd like to see. Lmk in the comments if you have suggestions.

&#x200B;

**Post Removals**

I will begin removing the hate and shit talk posts this afternoon and evening. I'm going to try to get it cleaned up before the casino opens tomorrow, but I can't possibly get to them all. It's the weekend, get it out of your system. But to be clear- we are not a fucking meltdown sub. This shit isn't going to be on the page under normal circumstances but I literally cannot keep up at this point so I'm going to just let it ride and do what I can, depending heavily on your self moderation to get rid of the bad shit with downvotes. **That doesn't mean I'm not removing posts for harassment though. I'm just saying I can't keep up and we are under construction.**

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if anyone reading this feels harassed by any post enough to report it. This is to be a safe space free of harassment and abuse or power trips. I am trying to get to it as quickly as possible, but this jungle has come with plenty of disclosures and warnings that it is wild and largely self moderated. Note that this is not a reflection of future intended content on this sub, it just is what it is and I'm doing what I can to keep up while also letting the apes speak. Please stay respectful out there. I know you will. ‚úå

&#x200B;

**Post Flairs are Live!**

&#x200B;

**User Flairs**

You can now set custom user flairs! Can somebody please hookup some instructions down below for how to set them? I've seen it shared around the comments and know you guys will help each other get it sorted. Please be respectful and somewhat SFW in your flairs, otherwise have fucking fun and express yourself. Flairs are dope as fuck. And I want them to remain custom for the community, as long as certain guidelines are followed. The sub rules, obviously, apply to user flairs as well. If I see a flair blatantly breaking any rules or is generally offensive I will reset it to a default. Obviously you can just go in and change it again, but we're all adults here and I trust you won't do that. üôÉ Set forth and flair thyself!

&#x200B;

**Positions or ban?**

(not really ban)

Do we want to show positions here? Can anyone argue good reason why it shouldn't be allowed? I do not wish to silence anyone from speaking on their investment in $GME but I'm also not wanting to steer anyone wrong here and don't feel it's really my decision anyway. Is this something that is allowed in other ticker subs, or even other trading subs? Is this a common practice that Superst\*nk excluded or is it wise to ban the posting of positions? I'm inclined to think it will help us weed out shills much more effectively, especially within the mod team. As much as I appreciate my privacy, I'm not above sharing my positions with you to know I'm true. I've already shared some on my twitter to make it known. And for the record, I don't necessarily have issue with asking other apes to share their positions (current) before being voted to mod. That's almost a no-brainer at this point. It's not about being elitist, it's about bringing on real diamond handed apes who won't spread paper hand FUD when MOASS is nigh.

So please vote accordingly below. For transparency, I will be voting to show positions. And if allowed, I'll show you I'm HODLing and have been since January. Please vote!

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading, thanks for being fucking awesome and true to the spirit of the Ape, and Welcome to the Jungle. ‚úå
