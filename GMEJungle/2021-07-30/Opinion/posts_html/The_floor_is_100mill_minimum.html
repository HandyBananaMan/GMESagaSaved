<p>In order for a UK ape to make 20million a share would have to be worth just below 50million dollars (accounting for tax &amp; transferring to sterling pounds). </p>
<p>So for the sake of every UK ape and because we should be greedy the absolute floor should be 100mil. </p>
<p>BUY &amp; HODL to the MOON no less.
