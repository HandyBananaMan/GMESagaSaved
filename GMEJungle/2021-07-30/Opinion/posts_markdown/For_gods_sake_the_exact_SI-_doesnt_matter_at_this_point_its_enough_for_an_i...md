# Title: For god's sake the exact SI-% doesn't matter at this point, it's enough for an infinity squeeze whether it's 226% or 133,769,420%. Stop calling apes shills and FUD spreaders just because they used a different method for calculating a different SI-%.

An infinity squeeze can happen at 2000%, or at 900%, or at 226%. And there are different methods of calculating an estimate for the SI-%. These different methods yield different values. Some give 226%, others give 2000%. **These are all estimates**, and the truth is that **we do not know the exact SI-%.** I've seen some people call /u/Criand a shill for christ's sake. Just because he estimated an "only" 226% short interest. People call this FUD. The truth is, his method was just as accurate as any other. And 226% is more than enough for an infinity squeeze.

SI-% of 226 is the highest there has ever been that I know of. It will make the price go to literally infinity until someone steps in to stop it by different means. If you're claiming that it's FUD to say that the SI-% is only enough to give us all only infinite dollars and only destroy all the hedge funds only forever, then you're probably the shill here.

Disclaimer: I'm not saying it *is* 226%. It might be way more. I'm saying 226% is more than enough, anything else is extra, and those claiming 226% are on our side.
