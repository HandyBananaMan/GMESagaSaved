You're aware there is an announcement at 4:15 regarding us derivative positions.

You're aware of how many times numbers have been fudged in the past.

You're aware these numbers will likely be incorrect, so as to cover something up.

You are aware.
Use your awareness to come to logical conclusions.

You're aware that your emotions will not get the best of you when these people lie through their teeth.

You are aware.
Use your awareness to drown out fud, to do your own research, to come up with your own conclusions; to buy and hodl.

I like the stock. I am aware.

Repeat it. 

Edit: I believe this is where these numbers are posted. https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/

Edit 2: It's a good thing Apes were aware today, and will continue to be more aware from here on out.
The derivative position announcement is heard to take place another day, not a surprise as apes were aware something like this would happen.
Take this lesson of awareness into any and all news on a stock.

A side note, I have become aware of the eviction moratorium bill being scrapped, as well as a $1T RRP, largest in history.

When people who gave their time, blood and effort to  the very thing that gave them freedom, all too soon to be taken from the very people who gave; they too become aware.

Take time this weekend to be in the present with yourself, not the past, not the future, right now.
