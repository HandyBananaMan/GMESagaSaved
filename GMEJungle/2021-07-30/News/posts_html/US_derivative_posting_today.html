<p>You're aware there is an announcement at 4:15 regarding us derivative positions.</p>
<p>You're aware of how many times numbers have been fudged in the past.</p>
<p>You're aware these numbers will likely be incorrect, so as to cover something up.</p>
<p>You are aware.
Use your awareness to come to logical conclusions.</p>
<p>You're aware that your emotions will not get the best of you when these people lie through their teeth.</p>
<p>You are aware.
Use your awareness to drown out fud, to do your own research, to come up with your own conclusions; to buy and hodl.</p>
<p>I like the stock. I am aware.</p>
<p>Repeat it. </p>
<p>Edit: I believe this is where these numbers are posted. https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/</p>
<p>Edit 2: It's a good thing Apes were aware today, and will continue to be more aware from here on out.
The derivative position announcement is heard to take place another day, not a surprise as apes were aware something like this would happen.
Take this lesson of awareness into any and all news on a stock.</p>
<p>A side note, I have become aware of the eviction moratorium bill being scrapped, as well as a $1T RRP, largest in history.</p>
<p>When people who gave their time, blood and effort to  the very thing that gave them freedom, all too soon to be taken from the very people who gave; they too become aware.</p>
<p>Take time this weekend to be in the present with yourself, not the past, not the future, right now.</p>
