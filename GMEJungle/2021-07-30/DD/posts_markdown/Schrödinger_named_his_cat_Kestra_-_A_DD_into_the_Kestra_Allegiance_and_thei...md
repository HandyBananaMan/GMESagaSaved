EDIT: This post has kinda become a work in progress. If it's messy or unclear I apologise, I'm trying my best to make sense of all of this.

**TLDR: The Kestra Enterprise seems to be a giant web of interconnected bullshit with a total portfolio value of about** ***10.5 trillion dollars*** **according to 7 SEC 13F filings that popped up in the last 12 months. It is presumed that the SEC filings are a mistake and in this post I examine just how big of a fuckup this is. Kestra also have direct links to Citadel and Vanguard ETF funds - does this actually mean anything? I don't know yet.**

Hey Guys,

&#x200B;

Some of you may remember me from [this post I made yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/otvabt/kestra_advisory_services_llc/) talking about Kestra Advisory Services, LLC and their [$8 Trillion portfolio on Fintel](https://fintel.io/i/kestra-advisory-services-llc).

&#x200B;

*Please read the first post before continuing otherwise none of this will make any sense.*

&#x200B;

A few of you were quick to point out that the value must be fake and whoever filed the 13F reports simply just made a mistake.

&#x200B;

Rather than argue with you I decided to agree because tbh that explanation brought even more questions to the surface:

1. Who fucked up?
2. When was the first fuckup and what was going on for Kestra at the time?
3. Why has no one noticed this yet?
4. Why has it not been corrected?
5. Why is a random group of nothing companies walking around with a 'fake' portfolio value of $10.5 Trillion and why is no one doing anything? Shouldn't this be something that is, idk... regulated?
6. How big is the Kestra Allegiance really?
7. Can I find any more connections to the GME lore that would give this tinfoil hat theory some depth?

&#x200B;

Armed with my recent discovery that the 2nd page of Google actually holds some interesting information, I dove in.

&#x200B;

All I can say is [buckle up baby cause this shit is weird as fuck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yywzQbZcDL0)

Let's Begin

&#x200B;

# 

# Part 1: Who fucked up?

&#x200B;

This one is easy, [Jennette Schlinke](https://edgar.sec.report/AdviserInfo/Individuals/3231591), her name is on all the 13F forms filed by the Kestra Allegiance - [link if you want to verify](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/ciks=0001830819&entityName=Kestra%2520Advisory%2520Services%252C%2520LLC%2520(CIK%25200001830819))

If we dig into Jannette we find that she used to work for [Raymond James Financial Inc](https://sec.report/CIK/0000720005) and [NFP ADVISOR SERVICES, LLC](https://sec.report/CIK/Search/NFP)

If we look into **Raymond James Financial** we see that [they were in some hot water back in 2019](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-178)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Okay okay more corruption, no big deal, thats pretty much SOP for this whole narrative.

But then I looked into NFP Advisor Services and found something interesting:

[Click this link](https://sec.report/CIK/Search/NFP) scroll down and click on [NFP Holdings, LLC](https://sec.report/CIK/0001580989) scroll down again:

&#x200B;

![Wait, what?](https://preview.redd.it/cs81o0w7kbe71.png?width=4088&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d0cf48d0adf5253f427d088052d099d16bec858)

&#x200B;

Look at their [US Import Records](https://import.report/company/Nfp-Holdings-L-L-C):

&#x200B;

![Thats a lot of Chinese Biotech ](https://preview.redd.it/1d502t4kkbe71.png?width=2076&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d430402d912d2527fbb480f5f9667b6a4a29559)

&#x200B;

Digging into these guys a bit more, they have been ordering insane amounts of  3-HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID SODIUM from these Chinese Biotech Companies:

&#x200B;

![This is just a screenshot, see the link above for the full list](https://preview.redd.it/mli780zp4ce71.png?width=2028&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d0fc566cbbab4dc8fd1ab11a608664338d3356a)

&#x200B;

A few people have linked this to the possible production of GHB. However it could also be used for a keto supplement or to make milk chocolate.... So, drugs or candy? let's find out.

Thank you u/LordToodleton for this helpful piece of info:

>Biochemist here, this is actually pretty interesting. From the looks of it, it’s probably going to use in the synthesis of vitamins, flavorings and pheromones (aromatic compounds) or in the production of medication. It’s a common human metabolite that has a shit ton of uses in the industrial chemistry sector. Could be GHB, but honestly GHB might be cheaper to make from other building blocks. It looks like they’re purchasing massive amounts of the salt form, which of course is a dry product and more efficient for transport.  
>  
>In the import records, I did see where they’ve been importing turmeric as well. This leads me to believe it’s for some bullshit (or legitimate, probably not) supplement they’re making. Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties, which I know 3-HB has been evaluated for several times. Who knows what they’re really doing with it, but my guess is cardiovascular health / anti-inflammatory supplements. But please, take this with a grain of 3-HB salt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It also looks like these guys have been in trouble for something:

# Part 2: 13F Filings

Okay, so the main question that started all of this was "who fucks up this bad?" like, [bitch have you seen how complicated a 13F is to fill out?](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm)

These are super in depth documents with many working parts. How do you go through everything only to then just add in 3 extra zeros by mistake?

Also the SEC are pretty fucking clear about how this shit works:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tzq6l05lmbe71.png?width=2102&format=png&auto=webp&s=139766195d4e486b101e84fb5c8349258deb8988

They also don't like to be fucked with:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/atzq1bx1nbe71.png?width=2010&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1fb1aa90ca854abcc9ed0009da6f20398d3c29c

&#x200B;

I mean it's even in big bold print on the 13F form itself.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c4u0i4d3nbe71.png?width=4700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4dca56ae1f78c84837995964921afb7318da2c

Also, if you do fuck up, then they have a very strict and clear amendment procedure:

&#x200B;

And yet here we have a 13F filed 11.12.2020 with **no amendment number**  for **5.3 Trillion Dollars**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g44tf8hdobe71.png?width=2606&format=png&auto=webp&s=604d319d58d25f28cba0e7afbb34ed95056be1a2

I come back to my original question: **how does someone fuck up this bad? Multiple times, with no correction?**

# Part 3: The first file

Okay now here is something interesting.

11.9.2020

[Kestra Private wealth files a 13F for 1.5 Billion](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001649451/000164945120000002/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

1.21.2021

[Kestra Private Wealth Files 13F for 1.3 TRILLION](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001649451/000164945121000001/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

11.12.2020

[Kestra Advisory 13F for 5.3 Trillion](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830819/000183081920000001/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

1.20.2021

[Kestra Advisory 13F for 8.6 Trillion](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830819/000183081921000001/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

Interesting dates right? Especially when you consider the fact that both of these companies haven't filed a singe 13F in the last 20 years and are now making intense gains in a very short period time EVEN IF THE NUMBERS ARE INCORRECT.

Also the very first 13F for KPW is in Billions. So if it is a mistake then they got it right the first time... why follow it up with repeating unaltered fuck ups?

&#x200B;

Now, KA submitted their first 13F in November 2020. According to SEC rules this must mean that something caused them to cross the $100 million threshold in November 2020.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

![ SEC 13F FAQ](https://preview.redd.it/ewliprflfce71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9276e01ccf66e06a27ddacb78bd0b91f013e3e6)

I did a search for 'Kestra Advisory Services November 2020' and found a whole bunch of articles like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a4gb4k1ggce71.png?width=2488&format=png&auto=webp&s=3556af991e333d6c4e39b9ba5ca0cf81e3bb5c25

&#x200B;

Financial Advice from a whole load of different institutions. There are too many to list, but honestly you need to see this with your own eyes to actually get it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jtljj4zngce71.png?width=2118&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7963fc05915984a2670fbd1e672bb9e6fd3c8eb

Now here is the kicker. They ALL have the following disclaimer:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ir0h2xxtgce71.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=404e6f5448b08e73948cc3305cf03a3a8e142832

&#x200B;

The only way to really grasp the logic of this is to see it for yourself. Search for 'Kestra Advisory Services November 2020' on DuckDuck and look at all the articles. Do a search on each page for 'Kestra' and it will take you to the disclaimer.

&#x200B;

All of this financial advice from loads of different sources comes out November 2020 and is linked to Kestra by a disclaimer. In that same month they file their first ever 13F - for 5.3 trillion.

Also, looks like [Kestra recruited a whole bunch of people late 2020](https://www.kestrafinancial.com/newsroom/news-releases/kestra-financial-closes-out-2020):

More names, more digging.

# Part 4: Does this have anything to do with GME at all?

Okay, so there is this vague Citadel connection that I want to come back to:

https://preview.redd.it/0dvxz322zce71.png?width=3548&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf02a7da5c1abfe8cf0ea8464de4036f4382374f

&#x200B;

But I also found [this](https://www.sec.gov/enforce/ia-5770-s), which loops back into the issues raised in my first post.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8c0zdq84jde71.png?width=2066&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a333d40568b012318a6b09b2438f1b36f72e0f

TLDR: on July 9 2021 Kestra got in trouble for "failing to disclose compensation" and "investing client assets in certain funds for which the affiliated broker-dealer received revenue" - Paraphrase.

I don't know, this seems a bit strange. Again, lots of jargon but to me it sounds like these guys have been pretty desperate for money over the last 6 months... why?
