    "selftext": "Forgive me as I\u2019m on mobile and I already accidentally lost the whole post  draft once navigating away to look for something\u2026 this is gonna be fast and dirty (the best way, really) of doing some DD. \n\nI was cross checking some DD on my own regarding GME being placed on the \u201cchill list\u201d idk what that means but considering it\u2019s like 90+ degrees outside and humid AF, it sounds like a nice list to be on. \n\n\nAnyways I\u2019m sure most of us remember this from April [JP Morgan chase sells 13bn in bonds in largest bank deal ever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-15/jpmorgan-to-sell-13-billion-of-bonds-in-largest-bank-sale-ever)\n\nNow if you KNOW your gonna have to help some little hedge funds with all their computers that earned PhDs or whatever un-fuck themselves from the royal fuckening they gave themselves; wouldn\u2019t it be smart to have, say, 13 billion in cash on hand? \n\nSo if you\u2019re big bank and you know you\u2019re gonna have to help others cover cuz you\u2019re a member of the DTCC, wouldn\u2019t you be looking to pull out of the corporation that is making you responsible for a mess that (for fucking once) you\u2019re not responsible for ASAP? I certainly would cuz fuck that shit! \n\nSo anyways I\u2019m reading the important notices and as I\u2019m scrolling I come across [this\u2026](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/7/22/MBS1006-21.pdf)\n\nJP Morgan Chase will\nNo longer trade mortgage backed securities thru the DTCC\n\nI\u2019m sure you can tell by now my brain is smoother than a baby\u2019s ass so can someone with more wrinkles please translate? Am I interpreting this right? What\u2019s re the implications of a big bank leaving the DTCC? \nI should say it refers ONLY to mortgage back securities trading\u2026 with how fucked the housing market is right now (we all know it is, if not, go check out the real estate pages on Reddit, they\u2019re fucking bleak!)  do y\u2019all think this is actually another sign of the MOASS approach or is chase covering themselves from the potential housing market collapse?",
