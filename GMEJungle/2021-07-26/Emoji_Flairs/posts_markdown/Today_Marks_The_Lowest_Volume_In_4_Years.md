I exported GME’s volume history to Excel using Yahoo’s historical data, so there MIGHT be errors.

Today’s volume is the **24th** lowest in the past five years.

Today’s volume was the **929th** on all time lowest volume.

ONLY the volume of the years 2017 and older beat today’s volume.

So today’s volume marked THE ![LOWEST VOLUME IN 4 YEARS!](https://imgur.com/a/RSLnaSb)

Apes be hodling hodling hodling all night long!

Edit: Ape reminded me that this ape forgot to put what today’s volume was.

Yahoo Finance reports that today’s volume is **1,251,888**. Again, there can be an error with the precise number. I have seen it change multiple times.

Edit 2: Here is a [Google Sheet link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ENYhJGbiql9ocPBQZnpApaX9ocJp0d1JVysYP6IfPm0/edit?usp=sharing) where I exported the historical data, organized it, and sorted by lowest volume.
