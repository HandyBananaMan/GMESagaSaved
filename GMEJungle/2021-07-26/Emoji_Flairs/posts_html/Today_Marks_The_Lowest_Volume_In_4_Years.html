<p>I exported GME’s volume history to Excel using Yahoo’s historical data, so there MIGHT be errors.</p>
<p>Today’s volume is the <strong>24th</strong> lowest in the past five years.</p>
<p>Today’s volume was the <strong>929th</strong> on all time lowest volume.</p>
<p>ONLY the volume of the years 2017 and older beat today’s volume.</p>
<p>So today’s volume marked THE <img alt="LOWEST VOLUME IN 4 YEARS!" src="https://imgur.com/a/RSLnaSb" /></p>
<p>Apes be hodling hodling hodling all night long!</p>
<p>Edit: Ape reminded me that this ape forgot to put what today’s volume was.</p>
<p>Yahoo Finance reports that today’s volume is <strong>1,251,888</strong>. Again, there can be an error with the precise number. I have seen it change multiple times.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ENYhJGbiql9ocPBQZnpApaX9ocJp0d1JVysYP6IfPm0/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet link</a> where I exported the historical data, organized it, and sorted by lowest volume.</p>
