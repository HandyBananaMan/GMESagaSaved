<p>There is one thing you do need to know during the MOASS, you will probably be alone.</p>
<p>Now that sounds dark and all but really, I believe all these stock related subs are going down from the admins or from FOMO rushes fucking the servers up. Personally with the recent updates on our mods dealing with the admins, it doesnâ€™t sound great. Even if the jungle closes to the public I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be working during the MOASS. </p>
<p>Honestly who really knows about GME thatâ€™s close to you? Most of us havenâ€™t told anybody or were pretty much shunned or mocked for buying GME, been there, done that. I have one friend who is invested in GME and ready for MOASS and thatâ€™s gonna be my go to guy. Other than that? No one I can trust or is interested in learning. Im pretty much alone.</p>
<p>While we are all a very tight knit group here and I see names every day that Iâ€™ve grown to enjoy conversing with, you wonâ€™t be around during the MOASS. Mentally keep that in mind, itâ€™s your time to shine and make the most of this once in a lifetime opportunity. And you know what? Thatâ€™s probably best. During the MOASS I believe we will see waves of shills, every TV channel, every YouTube video suggestion, every post and headline is going to be thrown at you to make you sell, make you think itâ€™s over. You know what you know, you canâ€™t rely on any of our DD writers to help you plan to sell, or anyone for that matter. I really hope Iâ€™m wrong, I hope I can get blackout drunk in the daily every day as we watch shit burn on wall st, but I donâ€™t have high hopes for it. </p>
<p>Remember the thesis, remember what you know and letâ€™s watch history happen, Iâ€™ll see you great bunch after the dust settles ðŸ¤™</p>
