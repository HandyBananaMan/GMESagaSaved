When moass starts, the greatest multi-billion dollar fud campaign in history will go into full effect.\nGme Jungle, Gme, and Superstonk will be flooded with thousands of posts from fake accounts claiming they sold and made fortunes. You think it\u2019s bad now? They will have thousands of fake accounts upvoting bullshit gains posts. Fake gains posts will outnumber real posts 10:1, and they will downvote any posts saying \u201chodl\u201d to fucking oblivion. When this happens, just remember, moass is inevitable. There is no escaping the hole these greedy fucks dug themselves into.\nI\u2019ll see you retards on the other side, love ya",
