    "selftext": "There is one thing you do need to know during the MOASS, you will probably be alone.\n\nNow that sounds dark and all but really, I believe all these stock related subs are going down from the admins or from FOMO rushes fucking the servers up. Personally with the recent updates on our mods dealing with the admins, it doesn\u2019t sound great. Even if the jungle closes to the public I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be working during the MOASS. \n\nHonestly who really knows about GME that\u2019s close to you? Most of us haven\u2019t told anybody or were pretty much shunned or mocked for buying GME, been there, done that. I have one friend who is invested in GME and ready for MOASS and that\u2019s gonna be my go to guy. Other than that? No one I can trust or is interested in learning. Im pretty much alone.\n\nWhile we are all a very tight knit group here and I see names every day that I\u2019ve grown to enjoy conversing with, you won\u2019t be around during the MOASS. Mentally keep that in mind, it\u2019s your time to shine and make the most of this once in a lifetime opportunity. And you know what? That\u2019s probably best. During the MOASS I believe we will see waves of shills, every TV channel, every YouTube video suggestion, every post and headline is going to be thrown at you to make you sell, make you think it\u2019s over. You know what you know, you can\u2019t rely on any of our DD writers to help you plan to sell, or anyone for that matter. I really hope I\u2019m wrong, I hope I can get blackout drunk in the daily every day as we watch shit burn on wall st, but I don\u2019t have high hopes for it. \n\nRemember the thesis, remember what you know and let\u2019s watch history happen, I\u2019ll see you great bunch after the dust settles \ud83e\udd19",
