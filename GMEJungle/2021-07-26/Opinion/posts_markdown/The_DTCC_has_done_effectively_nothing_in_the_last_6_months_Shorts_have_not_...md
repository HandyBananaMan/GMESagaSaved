When it is obvious that Margins should have been called - and have NOT ....

When the ONLY thing the DTCC does is pass new rule to CYA ...

When the SEC does NOTHING for 6 months ...


The only conclusion is - that they have discovered that the GME short position is untenable, and threatens to take down the entire financial system.  If this is the case, the ONLY insurance policy a prudent investor can take - is to go LONG GME - buy and HOLD.
