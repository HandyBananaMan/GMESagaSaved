<p>Why? I like the company and it's Hump Day so fuck it. I will be giving away a $50 GameStop gift card to whoever can guess the closest to today's volume.</p>

<p>Edit 2: This might have been a mistake. I've tried posting something the past few days and it never showed up. Nevertheless, I'm a man of my word and really hope that reddit allows the use of Ctrl + F.</p>
