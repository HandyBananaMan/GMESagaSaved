<p>MSM are pumping these articles out close to the launch of the IPO, because they want people to short the stock, it's a bear trap, it will ruin you.</p>
<p>Don't touch this garbage stock, let it die through irrelevance and a dwindling user base, or short it AFTER MOASS if that's your thing?</p>
<p>Not financial advice.</p>
