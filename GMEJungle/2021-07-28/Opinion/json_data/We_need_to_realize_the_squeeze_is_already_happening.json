    "selftext": "Every major hedge fund is working round the clock and panic hiring anyone and everyone they can to figure a way out of this, psychologists and social media influencers even to get inside your head and induce fear. They are spending billions to push the price back down and nothing is working. \n\nRegulators and the clearing house are trying to minimize damage as this is happening, it isn\u2019t when\u2026 it is already happening. \n\nAs soon as a stock is shorted more than 100% over the available float, the normal behavior of its price is gone. Even more so if over 2/3rds of the trading is in a dark pool setting and are printing fake shares and selling off to keep the price \u201cnormal\u201d \n\nWe have already won, it\u2019s just this simple question\u2026.how long do you want to hold to see how high the price can go? \n\nThis is not financial advice.",
