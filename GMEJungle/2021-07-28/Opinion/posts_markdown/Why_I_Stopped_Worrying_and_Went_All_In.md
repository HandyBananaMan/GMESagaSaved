There are **two** outcomes to this whole GME MOASS saga. 

#1. The DD is correct.

#2. The DD is incorrect. 


**That's the only two possibilities.** Now let's look at the outcome of both...


#1. The DD is correct, and sometime in the future we're all going to be awarded handsomely for our patience. 


#2. Every bit of DD is incorrect. Somehow thousands upon thousands of very bright apes misunderstood the entire situation and the whole MOASS thing won't come to fruition. So let's look at that. We've got a company that's got $2B cash, growing like a weed, and is headed by some of the most brilliant minds in the business world today. Once the NFT system is launched, they're going to be making money hand over fist. The stock is going to be worth hundreds of dollars per share over the next couple years as the company grows and steals market share from big electronics names like Amazon, Best Buy, etc. 


**Now we have reached our conclusion.** If #1 happens, we all get paid more money than any of us have ever had in our lives. If #2 happens, we **STILL MAKE MONEY** by holding shares in a company that we love. 


TL;DR: The stock is a no-brainer. Regardless of what happens, you'll either make SOME money, or an absolute mountain of cash. This is why I have no hesitations about going all-in.
