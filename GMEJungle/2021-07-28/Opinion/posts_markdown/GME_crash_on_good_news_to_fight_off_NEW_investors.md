Im not sure, but I got a feeling the price drops on good news is to try and hold new investors from investing, not to make us paperhand (as if we would ever do that).

Imagine having a few millions invested in gamestop, we don't buy a lot of stocks anymore and we don't sell them.

Now imagine if a few hundred thousand peoples joined in, they would most likely have a lot more capital ready to invest, and could buy a lot more volume in one go, than us long hodlers can.

Now imagine such a crazy buy pressure on a stock with this little liquidity.

In the end, it's not important tho, as my task is to buy and hodl.
