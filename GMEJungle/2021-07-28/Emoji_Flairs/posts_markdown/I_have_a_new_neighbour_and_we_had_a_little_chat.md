He is a single guy in his late sixties who is the chief accountant for a large estate agency in my county. The property he has moved into is rented and managed by the estate agency. On our second meeting I asked him why he was renting. His reply was...
"I've have just sold my own house at the top of this housing bubble as 'we' (the company) are expecting a substantial property and financial collapse within the coming months. I'll be able to buy a much nicer place to retire to within six to nine months!"
Confirmation bias locked in and Norks Jacked!
