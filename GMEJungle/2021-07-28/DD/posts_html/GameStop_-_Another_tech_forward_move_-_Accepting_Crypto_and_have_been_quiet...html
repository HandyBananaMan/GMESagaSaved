<p>Something many people do not know, GameStop currently (and for a while now) is accepting cryptocurrency for payment in stores. That's right - if you want to buy a PS5 (when in stock) with BTC or D0G3 or a number of other cryptos, you can do it - today. Right now. I believe this puts GameStop at the leading edge of payment processing and is a great sign of their tech pivot.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>GameStop partnered with the Flexa Network. For those unfamiliar, Flexa is a payment rail system that allows vendors to accept supported crypto currencies, instantly in real-time (no waiting for 30 minutes for the BTC to settle) while the vendor can chose to receive their payment in crypto or in fiat. GameStop chose wisely BC (Before Cohen) to participate in their initial launch and I think this is going to end up being one of the few brilliant things that the guard took on.  One HUGE benefit to Flexa is that their fees are a fraction of what the credit card processors charge, leading to more profit for GameStop.</p>

<p>This is a delicate line to walk to avoid appearing to shill, I am separating off the remainder of the post explaining how the tech works. If you care for the backend details, feel free to continue. My goal is to explain how the rail works and what happens to your crypto when you spend it at GamesStop. If you don't care about how it works you can stop reading here and just have your tits jacked that GameStop is leading the charge of the next generation of accepting payments!</p>

<p>Disclosure: I have a decent position in AMP (you'll learn a bit about it below)</p>
<p>Flexa is the payment network that is allowing GameStop to accept payments. It is its own payment rail and in no way utilizes traditional payment processing network. They have managed to create an environment that is fast, flexible, fraud-proof, and cheap. I will touch on each of these in a moment. </p>
<p>You might be thinking, "but how do I actually spend crypto at GameStop?" </p>
<p>Flexa is currently partnered with two wallets, SPEDN and Gemini Wallet. Downloading either of these apps and transferring crypto to the wallet will let you buy with Crypto. There are a handful of wallet support that is coming soon (BRD, CoinList, Coinme, Dharma, ShapeShift, Valora and ZenGo). They are also partnered with Shopify for online purchases. When you go to check out you open the wallet app, select a vendor, and select the crypto you'd like to pay in and it generates a one-time use barcode that GameStop currently scans as a gift card (this was to be able to get into stores quickly, but will eventually be a dedicated payment type in PoS systems just like Cash and Credit are today. GameStop scans your barcode, asks you for the pin displayed on your screen and the payment is done. Instantly. That simple. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the background, here is whats happening. </p>
<p>(FAST) Flexa utilizes a collateral token called AMP. When a payment is processed, an equal value of AMP is pulled from the staking pool and set aside to collateralize that transaction. As far as the vendor is concerned, at that point, they are getting paid no matter what happens from here. You take your goods and go. Lets say you are paying in BTC, traditionally if you wanted to pay someone in BTC you would have to get their wallet ID, send the BTC and wait upwards of 30 minutes for the transaction to settle before you could leave with your goods - not very plausible in a retail environment. With Flexa, the AMP that was set aside will remain until the transaction settles and then be returned to the staking pool. If for some reason the BTC transfer were to fail (unlikely), the AMP will be liquidated to pay the vendor and the loss would be spread amongst the wallets in the staking pool, which may not even be felt by anyone since its spread so thin. To my knowledge, to date there have been no instances of AMP being burned to cover a transaction. </p>
<p>(FLEXIBLE) GameStop has the choice of receiving the crypto that was paid, USD or CAD on their end. Crypto payments are immediately available and fiat funds are available the next day - much faster than traditional payment networks. </p>
<p>(FRAUD-PROOF)  Flexa eliminates chargebacks and unexpected reversals. Some scammers will come in and buy a shiny new console, go home and attempt to chargeback the transaction or claim that it wasn't them who made the purchase. Best case, GameStop wastes time and money fighting the chargeback, worst case they lose and are out their inventory. With chargebacks totaling $150 billion per year, often times on electronics, GameStop is protecting its gainz. </p>
<p>(CHEAP) Flexa charges on average 0.5% in processing fees. Compare this to the 2.53-3.45% (and set to increase in 2022) and its easy to see that the additional revenue they get to keep from payment processing costs alone will be huge.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wanted this to be less of an infomercial and more of an informative hype post and I hope it came across that way!</p>
<p>Tits jacked.</p>
