<p>ðŸ‘‰ <strong>Restricted status means that only approved members of this community can post.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>ðŸ‘‰ <strong>All other members of the community and the public can still comment and interact with posts (upvote/downvote, award, etc.)</strong></p>

<h1>Approvals</h1>
<p>Ok so I went over this in a previous post (that I ended up deleting honestly-we got hit with 5k approval requests in a couple hours so I had to take it down before we crashed servers or something idk)... I had referenced how to send modmail (shortcut in the sub menu) with the subject "approve". <strong>This is the only way to become an approved member.</strong> Modmail&gt;subject line "approve"&gt;body can say whatever you want&gt;approval asap.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>You will receive a message notifying you that you're an approved user when you're approved. About 5k of you probably received those today!</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you send more than one message, you will get automatically disapproved, or muted, because of the way I'm approving (using a macro to speed it up a bit, still supervised clicks though). Just one message with the word "approve" in the subject is all you need. Imagine if every 10th request was a duplicate- that creates a lot of unnecessary clicks! Thank y'all for understanding :)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="click \&quot;approve>click \&quot;approve>click \&quot;approve\&quot;>click \&quot;approve>click \&quot;approve\&quot;= AMAZING COMMUNITY" src="https://preview.redd.it/mlkz8hjg80e71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29b8a6c802866b6f80be91e3df9f3614febb8181" /></p>
<p><em>Also- although I can't respond to them all, I see all the lovely messages of support coming through with the approval requests- some funny, some heartwarming, all of them 100% the reason we are doing what we're doing. To protect the culture of the apes.</em> ðŸ’–</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, I have hit the rate limit and am on a timeout for approvals. I have made it through about 5.5k in the last 24 hours. (I think 6k-7k total, I'm not sure where to find an exact number of approved users atm). ^(I'm so glad I haven't broken reddit so far I'm impressed tbh and they said it couldn't be done :P)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I was trying to make it through those first 6-7k requests before making this post because I'm sure we will get a wave of messages again, which is totally welcome :) I just appreciate y'all understanding that I'm clicking as fast as I can.</p>

<p><em>Also as far as I know, the way I'm doing the approvals has rendered it basically impossible for</em> u/bodysurfdan <em>to do any approvals, just fyi. It's all happening through modmail.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>So I will say this, if you aren't big on posting, if you don't mind waiting a few days or a week or better before seeking approval, that would be dope.</strong> You will still be able to comment, but I want to make sure the regular posters are getting approved first. Having said that, I'm not curating content or members, as I've said the only requirement is to have an account older than July 10th, so anyone is welcome to seek approval really. Just a suggestion to help continue the flow of solid content as we transition to restricted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For reference, here is the settings page that shows the difference when you go from public to restricted.</p>

<p>It has been discussed if/when we should go totally private. This means the public could not view the content here. Please know this is a possible option in the future, especially around MOASS. This would, of course, only happen with a vote of the community via poll.</p>

<h1>Spam Filters, Collapsing Comments, and Removed Posts</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are so many reports lately of posts and comments being removed, posts not showing up in the feed, comments auto-collapsing, and more content filtering happening lately. To address this and make sure it wasn't something on our end, I removed all automod code last week and therefore no removals have been made by auto mod in 7 days.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But there are posts still getting removed, and it doesn't show up in mod log under mine or Dan's or automod or even admin's activity, so I'm not sure how it's happening. It has to be something outside our settings.</p>
<p>Here are the spam filter/crowd control settings for the sub currently:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/h0gql4ba5zd71.png?width=1510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91a8226366eeba1c018f83c672d0bc7a5cde1626</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/bb55zali5zd71.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f0e05aa88a3e50761e5bf7bb6d9848b140792ff</p>
<p>So there shouldn't be much spam filtering going on at all on our end, except on things that are highly negatively downvoted in the community. I'm not sure the cause nor the solution for these issues. Maybe closing the sub to a restricted level will help address these issues.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So once again u/bodysurfdan and I would like to thank you for taking care of this community with us and helping to keep it clean and safe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Love you always,</p>
<p>your local, litty ðŸ¤™ groundskeeper kitty ðŸ’–</p>
