    "selftext": "Many major writers of DD this past year have slipped off. Disappeared. The quality of dd, while still high, has fallen to less and less of. Why is this?\n\nI wrote Ragnarok. Shortly after I was approached to join a secret discord chat featuring prominent researchers, analysts, etc..., basically anyone who wrote a popular front page DD. The purpose? To effectively build a predictive algorithm for gme stock movement. \n\nIf you wanted to participate, you must sign the NDA. You cannot share your work, your research, or any part of the project. Your dd writing and posting gets shut down. Mama didn't raise no fool, and I aint sign shit. Even if you entice potential members with the presence of DFV in the discord. I don't buy it. \n\nThe last I saw before being kicked from the group is the prediction for the flash from from 300 to (edit: got my numbers wrong) 160. This is fundamentally wrong, to withhold such information.\n\nRelease the NDAs.\n\nEdit - \n\n/u/Sufficient-bowler741\n\nYou invited me. Why do you love buttfarms so much all of sudden lately",
