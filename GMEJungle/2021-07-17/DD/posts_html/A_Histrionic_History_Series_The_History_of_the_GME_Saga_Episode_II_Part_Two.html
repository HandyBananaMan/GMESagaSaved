<p>Part II <strong>"That's not the hard part. It's letting go."</strong>; Part Two &lt;---------- You are here</p>
<h1>Preface (Skip if you read Ep's I &amp; II)</h1>
<p>Smooth-brained dipshit here. If you are like me (retarded), you probably don't have the full picture on exactly where we have come from, where we are, &amp; where we are heading (hint: MOON). Fortunately for you, someone else smarter than me explained it to me (actually lots of people). Here is my best attempt to give you a digestible segment of GME history. To do so, we have to understand <strong>how</strong> the world we live in came to be.</p>
<p>What follows is an imperfect attempt to explain the FTDs, tactics of SHFs, and a heavy dose of macro event analysis and speculation as to their future current. What has happened, who we are up against, <strong>and what should be, IMHO, the true meaning and purpose of our movement will be treated on</strong>. I am not an FA. You would not be in this sub if you believed that people could easily be trusted.</p>
<p>Let me say this, trust <strong>NO ONE</strong>, not even dear OP to tell you where the bear shits in the woods. I am just one dumbass . No one owns this movement. No single person speaks for it. I understand history and econ <em>decently</em>. (Also, fuck Trotsky and Ken Griffin.)</p>
<p>This is a history summary. Not a soapbox where I tell you my beliefs (except as they relate to GME or scumbag government shit).</p>
<p>However, History, the story of those who change the world, is being written this very moment, by the very readers of these words. Just by removing GME shares from circulation, you have joined, whether you know it or not, the last shot left in the barrel against a <strong>highly</strong> imbalanced society. Don't fuck this up.</p>
<p>Before I make myself an ass by proving how little I understand, I would like to implore every reader to keep something in mind as you read this, as it had a massive impression on me recently when I encountered it. I will link the sauce in the comments, as I don't want this post removed for "anarchist shenanigans (I identify with my own philosophy, not anarchism or any other ideology mentioned in this post (if you are curious about my beliefs, listen to <em>Written In Uncertainty's</em> video "What happened to the Dwemer", the BEST lorecast on TES, I deny reality as real, don't take shit I say seriously)</p>

<p>In PM Bergman's introduction to <em>The Anarchist Cookbook</em>, he mentioned this while explaining anarchism as a philosophical postulate:</p>
<p>" as recently expressed more simply in a note left in a bank burned by Anarchists in West Berlin: “Make kaputt what makes you kaputt.”</p>
<p>The bank robbers from the heist in question did not rob that bank to get money.</p>
<p><em>They robbed the system of the means which it robs them (the people) of and by.</em></p>
<p>In case any of you apes have not realized this yet, the system does not value you. It does not want you to succeed. Want to have the American Dream? Want a car? Debt. House? Debt. Money to pay for debt? College. Debt. It is even worse for non-US citizens, since their governments have effectively tied their ships to the US, even if Bretton Woods is dead.</p>
<p>“Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion . . . and they’re now worth more than $4 trillion.”</p>

<p>"After it was a sure thing that America could wipe out a city with just one bomb, a scientist turned to Father and said, 'Science has now known sin.' And do you know what Father said? He said,</p>
<h1>'What is sin?”</h1>
<p>-<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1621115">Kurt Vonnegut</a></p>
<p>At this point in my wider explanation and argument, I would like to take a step back from our story so that I may relay a <strong>primary thesis and motive behind the creation of these essays to begin with.</strong></p>
<p>It was not until <strong>after</strong> they had detonated an atomic bomb, that scientists learned something pretty important.</p>
<p>From an article by RealClearScience,</p>
<p><em>"In 1942, Hungarian-American physicist</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller"><em>Edward Teller</em></a><em>, known now as "the father of the hydrogen bomb," entertained a devastating nightmare scenario: that an atomic bomb could ignite the atmosphere and the oceans. He reasoned that a nuclear fission bomb might create temperatures so extreme that it would cause the hydrogen atoms in the air and water to fuse together into helium, just like in our sun, generating a runaway reaction that would eventually engulf the globe, extinguishing all life and turning the Earth into a miniature star."</em></p>
<p>From the same source:</p>
<p><em>"</em> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Times-Brief-Guide-World/dp/031644961X"><em>according to author Pearl Buck</em></a><em>, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur Compton was so concerned that he told</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer"><em>Robert Oppenheimer</em></a> <em>that if there were even the slightest chance of this "ultimate catastrophe" playing out, all work on the bomb should stop."</em></p>
<p>While the Project (Manhattan) duly appointed a commission to investigate and study the matter, and although that commission argued that igniting the globe was "probably not very likely," the important point to come away with is that some of the world's leading physicists, including Einstein (who <a href="https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Resources/einstein_letter_photograph.htm">overlooked</a> his concerns), were <em>highly</em> uncertain as to whether or not the detonation of an atomic device would immolate the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The point, as I pray to God you might see, to come away with is that <em>despite their concerns, they did it anyway</em>. At this juncture, I would like to show this picture:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/34t8ztrlovb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb7df54be99dee0cf2c7cf49fbd592753926c8ff</p>
<p>For those of you who don't follow science, let me tell you: <strong>This is CERN</strong>. A fancy supercollider in Europe. Here, the world's leading experts test what "matter" really is and is not.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't follow Hinduism or Comparative Religion (I love you Michael Kirkbride, thank you for this gift), let me explain: <strong>This is Lord Shiva</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who can't bust a move, let me illumine: <strong>The dance Lord Shiva is doing is called "the dance of death."</strong></p>
<p>In Hindi lore, Lord Shiva, greatest of the mystical Gods, will perform this dance to herald in the destruction of existence, in accordance with his role within the wider Trinity of Deities (Brahma to create, Vishnu to maintain and redeem, and Shiva to destroy).</p>
<p>Yes. The people responsible for potentially generating antimatter (ohmigod) literally paid for and had installed a statue of a God "playing with the metaphysical Fire of God."</p>
<p>Are you starting to see what point underpins everything I've said thus far?</p>
<p>Do you <em>really</em> think that these people, these institutions, have humanity's best interest at heart? Do you <em>really</em> believe banks and financial institutions have the best concerns of the average person in mind? Do you <strong><em>really</em></strong> think that a man won't take power when it is there for the taking, even if doing so raises not only ethical questions, but questions about mankind's lack of responsibility to himself and every else in existence (we rape Mother Earth harder in every way, every year)?</p>
<p>Do me a favor. I will give you a whole host of choices of cool shit to look into. Take your pick, my treat.</p>
<p>The primary thesis expressed across all installments, with consistency, behind the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel">Brotherhood of Steel</a> (BOS) in the <em>Fallout</em> series as a faction is that mankind proved that he was unable to wield this "metaphysical fire." The legendary founder of the BOS, <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Roger_Maxson">Roger Maxson</a> was the living incarnation of this thesis (or argument or postulate, etc.) The BOS will preserve the knowledge of the "fire," but will actively withhold it from other takers, since only <em>it</em> can be trusted to not abuse this power. Despite their ideological aspirations, this is completely bullshit.</p>
<p>I mention the above item, as well as the succeeding one for the purpose of recommending good sources of media (we are gamers invested in a gaming company for Christ's sake). The primary inspiration behind the BOS comes from a faction in a book written by one-hit-wonder author, Walter M. Miller, known as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canticle-Leibowitz-Walter-Miller-Jr/dp/0553273817">A Canticle for Leibowitz</a>. Read it. It is worth it, and happens to be not only my favorite fiction book, but in fact my favorite book of all time.</p>
<p>I hope that the statements and expositions from above will, by hint, express what I don't have the balls to admit in plain English, but I will leave you with one more item:</p>
<p>"If you could, would you?"</p>
<p>"Once you do, then what?"</p>
<p>With those find two words, I would recommend going all the way back and re-reading the Kurt Vonnegut quote. You know what? Fuck it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nvqm_pPD-aQ">Listen until 00:22</a>.</p>
<p>With that, let's return to the story we all know and love.</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>EDIT: posting to this point so far as I continue the essay immediately. Just got bored.</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>LTCM ballooned its assets under management (AUM),  drawing over $1 billion of investor capital, and eventually maintaining positions (including those loaned to them [the majority of all positions, for the sake of increasing volume with leverage]) worth <strong>over 1 trillion USD</strong> (by '98).</p>
<p>As real estate markets in Asia collapsed, the crisis <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/crs-asia2.htm">expanded</a> into other markets, causing severe strain on the global economy, as the Russian government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis">repudiated its debts</a>, LTCM had been all the while employing arbitrage strategies to make money off of the previously explained price inefficiencies. This invariably exposed the firm to markets connected to the two above mentioned problems. When you happen to specialize in making prices efficient during a weird ass period (lol) of market behavior called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/contango_backwardation.asp">backwardation</a>, you get fucked.</p>
<p>Imagine that suddenly, <em>the whole bond market</em> starts to display pricings that don't make logical sense. This is basically what we will watch destroy LTCM. The prices were not doing as they expected, by converging, and instead <em>diverged further</em>. At this point, I feel I can no longer withhold the primary point behind even explaining the history of LTCM, but not only, as we will see, the firm entered this saga well-and-truly on its own right.</p>
<p>The <em>main point</em> of LTCM is that sometimes important and "smart" people get fucked because the world is a complicated place and its hard to capture something as complex as a global economy in a bunch of formulas that compose your trading strategy. Hmmm. Why is u/LaissezFaireMan mentioning this bullshit?</p>
<p>I briefly made an allusion to the established historical facts that <strong>whenever the Fed thinks it has the market figured out</strong> (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softlanding.asp">example Greenspan 1</a> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp">result Greenspan 1</a>; <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/financial-crisis-review.asp">result Greenspan 2</a> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke">Bernanke</a> may well have literally had Greenspan on speed-dial, if his actions are an indication]; <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/1970s-great-inflation.asp">Everything Arthur Burns</a> ever believed about Keynesianism [in which study it seems he omitted <a href="https://www.richardcorbett.org.uk/austerity-keynes-and-debt/">the following</a>]; <strong>a crash happens.</strong> The best argument for this mas made by the <a href="https://www.wnd.com/2008/03/59405/">Fed itself</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>They aren't</em> alone. Famous founder (and therefore philosophical rival to Keynes) of the Freidman school of economics, Milton Friedman, according to the immediately preceding source,</p>
<p><em>"In 'A Monetary History of the United States,' Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman along with coauthor Anna J. Schwartz lay the mega-catastrophe of the Great Depression squarely at the feet of the Federal Reserve."</em></p>
<p>From Milton himself:</p>
<p>" <em>Well, we have to distinguish between the recession of 1929, the early stages, and the conversion of that recession into a major catastrophe.</em></p>
<p><em>The recession was an ordinary business cycle. We had repeated recessions over hundreds of years, but what converted [this one] into a major depression was bad monetary policy.</em></p>
<p><em>The Federal Reserve System had been established to prevent what actually happened. It was set up to avoid a situation in which you would have to close down banks, in which you would have a banking crisis. And yet, under the Federal Reserve System, you had the worst banking crisis in the history of the United States. There's no other example I can think of, of a government measure which produced so clearly the opposite of the results that were intended.</em></p>
<p><em>And what happened is that [the Federal Reserve] followed policies which led to a decline in the quantity of money by a third. For every $100 in paper money, in deposits, in cash, in currency, in existence in 1929, by the time you got to 1933 there was only about $65, $66 left. And that extraordinary collapse in the banking system, with about a third of the banks failing from beginning to end, with millions of people having their savings essentially washed out, that decline was utterly unnecessary.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>At all times, the Federal Reserve had the power and the knowledge to have stopped that. And there were people at the time who were all the time urging them to do that.</em></strong> <em>So it was, in my opinion, clearly a mistake of policy that led to the Great Depression."</em></p>
<p>Why don't you go ahead and reread that last paragraph.</p>
<p>Let's return to LTCM. So, now that Asian economies, and Russia, are dying on their ass, what is the Fed going to do to prevent all of America's largest <a href="https://www.bauer.uh.edu/rsusmel/7386/ltcm-2.htm">banks</a> from dissolving because they both <em>loaned money</em> and <em>loaned asset to bet with</em> to LTCM.</p>
<p>The year is 1998. Look at this</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/l46teydozvb71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3001ce305d3a5015e3c995e10bdb4aec7c20b7a5</p>
<p>Pretend you are Alan Greenspan (we do lots of pretending here, listen to the fucking lorecast I recommended in the preface).</p>
<p>What is today the equivalent of 1.67 trillion dollars is about to just evaporate before your very eyes if you don't act. <strong>1.67 trillion.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>1.67 TRILLION DOLLARS</em></strong></p>
<p>That is what you are <strong>guaranteed</strong> to lose if you do nothing. Imagine, as no doubt Greenspan did at the time, "what will happen if these banks and really 'safe' investors who invest hundreds of millions of dollars every year in LTCM go belly-up? I wonder if that might just trigger the weird recessions happening elsewhere to come here..... SHIT! I have to act <em>quickly</em> if I don't want the entire US economy to die on its ass."</p>
<p>So you, Greenspan, with these august ruminations in mind, act <strong>quickly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In case you can't tell,</strong> what I am about to quote below is what a <strong>government bailout</strong> used to look like.</p>
<p>"...in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months due to a combination of high leverage and exposure to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis">1997 Asian financial crisis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis">1998 Russian financial crisis</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management#cite_note-Ferguson-3">[3]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master-feeder">master</a> hedge fund, <strong>Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P.</strong>, collapsed soon thereafter, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998, among 14 financial institutions<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management#cite_note-4">[4]</a> for a $3.6 billion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recapitalization">recapitalization</a> under the supervision of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System">Federal Reserve</a>. The fund was liquidated and dissolved in early 2000.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management#cite_note-5">[5]</a>"</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">Sauce</a></p>
<p>In essence, Greenspan promised that he would <strong>make more money</strong> if the <em>private institutions</em> (<strong><em>banks</em></strong>) who agree to inject capital into failing LTCM positions (ya know, to prevent them from just evaporating and failing) need money if the LTCM positions <strong>keep</strong> incurring <strong>truly tremendous losses</strong>.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Well, I guessed they stopped the bleeding right? Aside from the money, what was the <strong>actual real cost</strong> of the collapse of LTCM?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I am going to leave my last sentence unanswered (in accordance with so far doing the same), and just leave <strong>you</strong> with the <strong>story</strong> and let you figure out the really hard answer to what I just asked you. Let's hope the pic below really drives this home.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/uihfemfh1wb71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2754a227f86a8a139418f851a1ffc20dd6c409e8</p>
<p>Guess who gets to pay this price? (1 <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp">Classic</a>; 2 <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp">Millennial Version</a>)</p>
<p>At this point, we are going to fast-forward to 2006. Here is what interest rates <em>from the beginning of 1995 to this point</em> look like.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/56feug2t2wb71.png?width=888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ebc8f2062883290b246514c581e1661b551e6b1</p>
<p>As you can see, coming out of the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, rates were cut. They would never again reach the pre-dotcom bubble levels.</p>
<p>However, after 9/11 faded into the rear-view mirror, rates began to increase beginning in 2004. Bernanke maintained them at this plateaued level for quite a while.</p>
<p>At this point, rates have been low (relatively) for a decade and a half. Asset prices during the 90's experienced considerable YOY (year over year) increases, stuff like stocks, houses, etc.) Although the dot com bubble bursting in 2000 would take the wind out of the stock markets sails until 2005, there was no such outflow of capital from real estate markets.</p>
<p>Cue the Hard Times (<strong>HARD</strong>)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/sw2ye6gr3wb71.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=405c5d718691a0865fca1c0f950f0989f8e2e929</p>
<p>See this guy? This be Ben Bernanke. He led the Fed. He got left holding Greenspan's bag, as you will see.</p>
<p>During the period of time when real estate prices enjoyed considerable YOY increases, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp">a shadow</a> had emerged on the all-too familiar real estate market.</p>
<p>Pretend I am a really big bank. Pretend you are just a small-time state bank. You specialize in taking deposits, using those deposits to invest in safe money markets (t-bills often). You also make a majority of your returns from lending to ordinary people so they can buy a house.</p>
<p>During the late 90's and early 2000's, the US government increasingly adopted policies aimed at expanding the gross percentage of US citizens as homeowners. As time progressed, the private sector ran (full steam ahead) with this notion. Soon, most people get a house with a historically low rate. Pretty soon, all the people with good credit start to run out. But you're a bank. You <strong>have</strong> to loan to people (LITERALLY in the fuckin job description). So what do you do?</p>
<p>Easy, just expand the pool of people you loan to; said another way since there is nobody with good credit left, <strong>let's loan to people with un-good</strong> (read: catastrophic) <strong>credit</strong>.</p>
<p>"Okay, that will work. All we need to worry about is doing what Uncle Sam tells us (make more US citizens homeowners). They have a proven track record that they will foot the bill if shit gets out of hand. This is their mess, obviously the world's largest government is paying attention to what we as a collective industry are doing in exposing our economy to such an obvious risk," they no doubt thought. Take a step back here. Who is more to blame? A sixteen year old crashing a car, or <strong>your dumbass for giving it to him</strong>?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again, I will leave it to you to answer this question. Moving on. Greenspan, during his entire career as Fed Chair, argued that markets self-correct, and therefore, certain government oversights and regulations are unnecessary. So what were the two solutions the private sector came up with to manage the massive risks obviously present in loaning to people with no credit history or assets whatsoever?</p>
<p>Let's pretend for a moment that we are all really smart. Let's pretend also that I am still that really big bank and you are still that really small one.</p>
<p>When you give those shitty loans to those perfectly normal people with really shitty credit, you see that there is a clever solution to the increased risks of your new types of products: raise the price. It stands to reason, that within a market, the biggest "risks" typically offer promises of higher pay out. So what is the solution?</p>
<p>What if we give people with no fucking credit at all the following loan:</p>
<p>We get you that house, you agree to let the interest rate of <strong>30 year debt obligation</strong> float with rates. What does this mean? If the Fed increases rates, the people <strong>most at risk</strong> of not being able to pay their loan <strong>will end up paying more when rates go up</strong>. I wonder if anyone actually wrote this retarded idea out in a sentence like I just did for you. I wonder if any of these people stopped and asked themselves," Just because <strong>I can do this, or am being told to</strong> (by Uncle Sam directly as a result of fiscal policy [lack thereof])<strong>, should I?</strong></p>
<p>The poignancy of that question has weighed on my heart for many years. It is reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">something we've seen before</a>.</p>
<p>What was that second solution I mentioned?</p>
<p>As an industry leader, I buy off mortgages from you. I can obviously see that there are some risks associated with buying these subprime mortgages (loans to people with bad credit) from your dumbass. I am super smart, and create a clever way to profit from this increased risk.</p>
<p>Imagine you are me (the big bank). Imagine yfw when you see you have a bunch of shitty mortgages in your portfolio. What will you do? Easy, dice these mortgages up into massive "baskets." If we put 3 percent of loans that are likely to fail <em>in a fund</em> that you can trade with 97 percent <em>likely</em> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>to default/file bankruptcy</em>, it effectively eliminates risk from the products entirely.</p>
<p>Damn. That is a really interesting and thoughtful solution. They call it <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp">Collateralized Debt Obligations</a>. "Collateralized" because even if people file bankruptcy, <em>we still have a house to sell</em> <em>to someone else with shitty credit</em>. I wonder if there were shortcomings with this.</p>
<p>By 2006 rates had peaked. Many people could not afford to pay their mortgages. Slowly, like an almost invisible wave moving through the market, cracks started to appear all over the world.</p>

<p>But as those who know this story know <strong>well</strong>, it does not have a happy ending. In fact, I would say that every person capable of reading this is not capable of imagining what will happen "if the music stops." But fear-mongering over the inevitable consequences of how we as a society exist, function, and allow ourselves to be ruled are not the focus of this Episode. This is history.</p>
<p>Which nobody ever bothered learning from.</p>
<p>I will just end this presentation by mentioning one final piece, for all those who have heretofore missed it. I will just directly quote Wiki</p>
