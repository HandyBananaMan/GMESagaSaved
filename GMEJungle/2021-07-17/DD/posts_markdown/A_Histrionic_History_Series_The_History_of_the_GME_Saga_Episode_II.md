Welcome back. If you're reading this and haven't read part [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/olzh0x/a_histrionic_history_series_the_history_of_the/), I would recommend it. It will give a clearer picture of what you should and should not expect from these posts. It is meant to be funny, and to offer up as many relevant banalities as I find interesting.

Part II "Maestro" <---------- You are here

# Preface (Skip if you read Part I)

Smooth-brained dipshit here. If you are like me (retarded), you probably don't have the full picture on exactly where we have come from, where we are, & where we are heading (hint: MOON). Fortunately for you, someone else smarter than me explained it to me (actually lots of people). Here is my best attempt to give you a digestible segment of GME history. To do so, we have to understand **how** the world we live in came to be.

What follows is an imperfect attempt to explain the FTDs, tactics of SHFs, and a heavy dose of macro event analysis and speculation as to their future current. What has happened, who we are up against, **and what should be, IMHO, the true meaning and purpose of our movement will be treated on**. I am not an FA. You would not be in this sub if you believed that people could easily be trusted.

Let me say this, trust **NO ONE**, not even dear OP to tell you where the bear shits in the woods. I am just one dumbass . No one owns this movement. No single person speaks for it. I understand history and econ *decently*. (Also, fuck Trotsky and Ken Griffin.)

This is a history summary. Not a soapbox where I tell you my beliefs (except as they relate to GME or scumbag government shit).

However, History, the story of those who change the world, is being written this very moment, by the very readers of these words. Just by removing GME shares from circulation, you have joined, whether you know it or not, the last shot left in the barrel against a **highly** imbalanced society. Don't fuck this up.

Before I make myself an ass by proving how little I understand, I would like to implore every reader to keep something in mind as you read this, as it had a massive impression on me recently when I encountered it. I will link the sauce in the comments, as I don't want this post removed for "anarchist shenanigans (I identify with my own philosophy, not anarchism or any other ideology mentioned in this post (if you are curious about my beliefs, listen to *Written In Uncertainty's* video "What happened to the Dwemer", the BEST lorecast on TES, I deny reality as real, don't take shit I say seriously)

In PM Bergman's introduction to *The Anarchist Cookbook*, he mentioned this while explaining anarchism as a philosophical postulate:

" as recently expressed more simply in a note left in a bank burned by Anarchists in West Berlin: “Make kaputt what makes you kaputt.”

The bank robbers from the heist in question did not rob that bank to get money.

*They robbed the system of the means which it robs them (the people) of and by.*

In case any of you apes have not realized this yet, the system does not value you. It does not want you to succeed. Want to have the American Dream? Want a car? Debt. House? Debt. Money to pay for debt? College. Debt. It is even worse for non-US citizens, since their governments have effectively tied their ships to the US, even if Bretton Woods is dead.

“Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion . . . and they’re now worth more than $4 trillion.”

We have seen some amazing DD. In fact, it is *so* numerous, that I am not going to link all the great DD I think you need to see in order to get an understanding, at a surface level, of the complicated events we have been witness to. I will, however, link the best DD delivers' profiles ([Criand, who did excellent research on options](https://www.reddit.com/user/Criand/posts/), [peruvian bull who does an excellent explanation of the Dollar and its status as a the WRC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o4vzau/hyperinflation_is_coming_the_dollar_endgame_part/), and [atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm83eb/a_house_of_cards_parts_i_ii_iii_in_pdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an all-round badass at everything he touches.

To say that the 1990's witnessed a belief and suspicion in a "New Economy," that would end up blinding its adherents to the cost of their acts is an understatement. To properly contextualize the 90's, I have previously labored to give some understanding of how things have developed up to now, relative the US adopting and then defending its geopolitical role as global hegemon. The associated "imperialism" this involves is more the infuriating when you realize it is not just the third-world economies being exploited. Rather, I hope to display how **you** are just as fucked by Uncle Sam as they.

&#x200B;

I hope that in postulating this view of events, fellow common men and women will see just how bad this system is, and realize what **we should be doing when we buy and hodl GME**. I will cover this after Part III, which will be less history, and more of a focus on the present material situation. Part IV will cover my speculations as to the likely flow of events based on an imperfect understanding of the wider components simultaneously acting.

Back to the story...

In 1987, with Volcker still chair, after America had spent almost a decade battling inflation tooth and nail, people felt hopeful and optimistic again. They were ready to emerge from hard times and make a difference in the world again. Entrepreneurs, highly sophisticated traders and quants, new options pricing methods (big one here), and capital flooded into the financial system. New businesses were being started again as the Fed began to decrease interest rates from all-time highs.

As the minutes from the Policy actions undertaken by the Fed (Volcker) from the [first meeting of the FOMC of 1987 put it](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcropa19870331.pdf):

*"Data on employment and production suggested a sizable advance in output in early 1987. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose more than 300,000 per month over the first two months of the year, appreciably faster than in 1986; large gains were reported in construction, trade, and services. In addition, the average workweek has lengthened, and total hours worked by production and nonsupervisory personnel have risen sharply from the fourth quarter. The civilian unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in February for the third consecutive month as increases in the labor force matched the strong expansion in employment."*

Things were rolling right along. They were clearly contemplating rate hikes from as early as Feb of 87. From the same report:

*"...continuing weakness in the dollar would suggest the possibility that some limited adjustment in policy implementation in a firming direction would be appropriate."*

For context,  the current federal funds rate as of July 15, 2021 is **0.10%**. The Fed funds rate peaked at 7.67% in April of '87. Rates declined and then were raised significantly from a low of 6.54% back up to 8.38% in Sept, setting a new peak. This is often considered part of a cause of the 87 crash... raising rates a little quick and spooking people. At this point, Volcker is still Chairman. Greenspan then takes the reins of the Fed in June of '87.

**And then, it hit.**

In October of 1987, the single worst day market crash, across several money markets, **in human history** occurred. The developments in the computer industry making its way onto Wallstreet are often cited as a *major* accelerant for this event: computers began to replace human traders; computers are programmed by the traders to sell off if assets declining past a certain price threshold (stop loss orders, the trademark play of a fucking faithless loser); when every big boy on the block is selling at the same time (because a sell-off triggers the computers to **liquidate**) it makes prices DOA because supply is exceeding demand (opposite of a short-squeeze).

The new Chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, issued the following statement that day:

*"The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation’s central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system."*

This single statement, along with the action the Fed put behind it, began to calm the excessive fear and volatility that had developed in the market. And as time would prove, the Fed **did act** to prevent the crisis from deepening. Remember, no one knew at the time the crash would not just keep going. Having lived through the dark days of the stagflation and resultant interest rate hike, most American were **very** wary to deal with high inflation again. The hawkish sentiment that the Volcker chairmanship over the Fed had created had bled into the economy as a whole. When the crash hit, many felt certain that this was part of a larger correction, as asset prices rose *considerably* coming out of the latter Volcker term.

By the time the crash had hit, there were serious exposures present throughout the traditional (and usually small, relative to investment banks today) Savings and Loans (S&L) institutions. Despite successfully reassuring the confidence in the Fed to act against instability in the economy, it would develop that concrete measures would be needed to confront the S&L problem, which by the early 90's would expand in scope to be a full-blown financial crisis unto itself.

As equity markets calmed and resumed course, the public was dazzled by the man, who with a few words, had saved the day. Never in American history did people feel that Fed was now run by people smart enough to just "skip" a crisis. The cult of personality that ubiquitously, though discretely, surrounded Greenspan (until 2008) had been born.

During the later years of the 80's, Greenspan and Fed would change the Fed's policy of releasing information of rate changes a month after the fact to **in real-time**. FOMC minutes would be public after processing, i.d. "immediately." The argument for this (and a fair one at that, taken solely in the individual context of this case specifically) was that markets would reprice to the news about rate changes, allowing the markets themselves to correct course in accordance with the Fed.

A popular saying, invoked to the day, aptly captures the relationship Greenspan fostered between the equity markets and the Fed," Don't fight the Fed." This is evidence of Greenspan's faith in the markets to inherently act in a self-corrective manner (as it stands to reason that doing what is best for business long-term would be something executives gave a shit about... obviously, as Greenspan would get to learn, kids (the market) do what they want if you let them.

The year is 1995. A recession during the Bush Sr. presidency (89-93) and an S&L crisis has seen 1,043 out of the 3,234 US S&L institutions fail.

I want you to read this. It is from Wiki. **Pay particular attention to the final sentence**, it will become important as the posts continue. Links left for your pleasure

" *In 1979, the* [*Federal Reserve*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve) *of the United States raised the* [*discount rate*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_window) *that it charged its member banks from 9.5 percent to 12 percent in an effort to reduce inflation. The building of S&Ls had issued long-term loans at fixed interest rates that were lower than the interest rate at which they could borrow. In addition, the S&Ls had the liability of the deposits which paid higher interest rates than the rate at which they could borrow. When interest rates at which they could borrow increased, the S&Ls could not attract adequate capital, from deposits to savings accounts of members for instance, and they became insolvent. Rather than admit to insolvency, some S&Ls took advantage of lax regulatory oversight to pursue highly speculative investment strategies. This had the effect of extending the period where S&Ls were likely technically insolvent. These adverse actions also substantially increased the economic losses for the S&Ls than would otherwise have been realized had their insolvency been discovered earlier.*[*\[4\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis#cite_note-4) *One extreme example was that of financier* [*Charles Keating*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Keating)*, who paid $51 million financed through* [***Michael Milken***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Milken)\*\*\*'\**s "*[*junk bond*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_bond)*" operation, for his* [*Lincoln Savings and Loan Association*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Savings_and_Loan_Association) *which at the time had a negative net worth exceeding $100 million."*

[Sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis)

Basically, S&L's were dying left and right.  To belatedly deal with and prevent this from happening again (which it would, in different institutions and industries) Congress later passed the [Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Institutions_Reform,_Recovery_and_Enforcement_Act_of_1989). In the meantime, the Fed (Greenspan) cut rates to about 5 and half percent (5.67%), and kept rates off their pre-crash '87 (Volcker) peak, until June of 88, when rates would surpass that peak. In 1990, Greenspan will maintain his highest rate (9.90%). It will never reach this point ever again.

From this point onward, Greenspan, whether in thinking or whatever but **certainly in practice**, would adopt an easy-money policy. The actions undertaken by the US government, across many agencies and instruments, effectively saw Uncle Sam subsidize and pay for the whole affair. Cue [the "Greenspan Put.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspan_put)"

By encouraging government subsidization of the S&L Crisis, markets felt *implicitly guaranteed* that if losses were severe enough to an institution vital to the economy, the Fed would not sit idly by as the financial world collapsed.

Unfortunately, the course of events only reinforces this [tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard). The theoretical doctrine of "[too big to fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)" had finally become a reality as state policy of world's largest, most significant actor.

As George W. Bush Sr. lost his reelection bid, a new, younger man with new ideas became president. This man, to the surprise of even Greenspan himself, **listened** to Greenspan and the Fed. This was effectively unheard of. Most political regimes that the Fed had had the displeasure of dealing with usually attempted to politically pressure the Fed (almost universally wanting to cut rates to "stimulate the economy." During his tenure as Fed chairman, relations with the White House under Reagan were strained. Reagan's Treasury Secretary [Nick Brady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_F._Brady) (88-93) constantly attempted to push the White House's desire for lower interest rates on the Fed (sound familiar?).

Clinton seemed inclined to refrain from this tendency. He, via two no names as Treasury Sec, worked *with the Fed*. In effect, Clinton was offering the US governments help *in reducing deficits*. THIS IS CALLED FISCAL POLICY. They (the gov) technically is **always** supposed to mind the shop of fiscal policy to make the Fed's job easier (so that the dollar is not wholly dependent on the Fed to raise rates). In theory, this hadn't happened before. Not since the 50's did America produce trade balances in her favor. Deficits predominated. (Note how back then the Fed realized it was doing all the work of protecting the Dollar. Deficits only continue to go up at increasing rates anymore. If neither the gov or the Fed attend their [fiscal](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/senate-democrats-3-5-trillion-budget-plan-goes-big-finally-n1274013) and [monetary](https://marketnews.com/mni-fed-s-powell-xxx) policy behaviors, who will protect the Dollar?)

Other secretaries came and went, mostly unremarkably. However, [Robert Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rubin) took over the reins as Treasury Sec in 1995. Greenspan (Sundance) had found his Butch Cassidy. Under the direction of these two men working closely in tandem (towards the same ends), the federal government under Clinton began to decrease at a rate unseen since Reagan (except to the military, that is, which Reagan *unaffordably expanded* during his terms, increasing deficits by a wide margin \[especially after trickle-down economics succeeded in lowering taxes\]).

As the recession of the early 90's abated, the Fed raised rates (FFR) from a low of 2.6% in Dec of '92 to 6.3% in Mar of '95. Lower lows and lower highs continued to shape the Greenspan era over the Fed. Businesses began to experience heightened productivity. After scouring all the data at his disposal, Greenspan developed the working assumption that the cause for this was likely increased anxiety in workers about their expendability, causing them to work harder for the same amount of compensation (making the economy more efficient). At the time he released this theory to the public, it was received as a joke. I mention it here because as history has progressed (for all the faults of Greenspan), let us issue credit where it is due. Greenspan's theory is the only one to date that has offered anything resembling a satisfactory answer to this question. He appears to have gotten this one square on the head.

Aside from the remarkable deference shown the Fed during this period, the most interesting story to mention at this stage in time is [Long Term Capital Management.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTCM)

[When genius is put in charge!](https://preview.redd.it/0dixfwdvxub71.png?width=240&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58dca60ffe2ffc3555ffd26b9ad4947d49d30f6)

In 1994, [a former trader from the arbitrage desk of Solomon Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Meriwether), founded a hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM). LTCM made money through something called (government) bond [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp). What this basically entails is akin to the following:

Imagine I (lemonade stand) sell you a glass of lemonade. We agree to you paying me for the glass in 30 years. Imagine you come back the next day and the same thing happens. When you make that second promise to me, for just a second, there is a discrepancy in the "value" of the promises you made me. It doesn't matter to the observer (the guy making money off the spreads of your promises to me \[arbitrage speculator\]) which is more expensive. Technically, as you are giving me more of an existing product, the old product (the debt promise you owe me) is worth less because you are inflating the supply of the same product. When arbitrage traders step it, it closes the price discrepancies in the market, making it more efficient and accurate in pricing. All arbitrage is just making money of the spreads in price inefficiencies. Given the low spread, usually, volume is needed to make serious money.

So if you are LTCM, what do you do? You just convince everyone you are smarter than they are ([by hiring the guy who literally invented options pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Scholes), and [a literal rocket scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Merton) to your trading and risk-eval desks, both of whom are Nobel Prize Laureates), these fuckers will give you money. Then, through your really smart formulas, the next year, you return **21%** to your investors. Suddenly, all the banks and people who did not take LTCM seriously when they came looking for funding at first go full on [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out).

Left and right, the world's biggest investors and banks fought for the privilege of investing in LTCM. Banks competed just for the right to lend LTCM their assets. By the second year of operation, LTCM posted a **43%** return to investors. Most (read:all) took this money and put it right back into the fund. (Myron Scholes, the living-half of the duo who invented the options pricing formula we use nowadays, kept the cash award from his Nobel Prize, so he did not lose everything \[lol, it was like 100 grand or something, he was a milli0naire who put all of the rest of his money \[like everyone else involved\] back into the fund so he still lost big)

By the third year of operation, LTCM posted a return of **41%** (compare that to your shitty 401k or pension fund). However, this year, the firm's fourth, would spell disaster for the entire world.

Remember in Part One when I mentioned how if a central bank of a country does not have enough USD to go out and buy its own currency of the market, then speculators and other treasuries will destroy your currency? Remember how I mentioned this happening to Asia, [Thailand,](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27912162) in particular, in 1998-99?

Cue the fuckin Good Times.

&#x200B;

[DJI average 91-99](https://preview.redd.it/v6ccubbb3vb71.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=60403ef5c52338102ffbae4fe18a04fb2a1def92)

Because of increased worker productivity, reducing deficits and balance of payment, and a massive concentration of the world's capital into money markets like stock, real estate, and commodities, the US is having the most protracted expansion in its history. Rates are higher, but get cut from highs around 6% to around 5% for the median part of the decade.

Even though you can't tell from the picture above, a significant portion of the real economies of the world essentially failed in this period. Runs on currencies were disastrous and rampant. They would only worsen in time.

While things were looking good for most, the latter years of the 90's brought crisis. But just as before, the Fed, and Greenspan **directly** by extension, would not let a crisis come to the shores of America. What follows is a tragic story about how the Greenspan Put was taken from an implicit guarantee to a concrete fact reflective of US policy. As stated, it is incumbent on the expectations people have for the roles of central banks that these institutions correlate with (exactly as mentioned in Part I) *with less frequent crashes*. It is a sneaking suspicion of many that the price for this is *worse and deeper crashes.* But don't take my word for it, watch the rest of the story unfold. You will see just how this system came to be, and ultimately, how it will die.

There is **so** much history I am trying to ELI5 for you. Things get skipped, oversimplified, and sometimes forgotten. It is quite an imposing notion to keep the remaining past events in a single post. Therefore, a second part to this section will be released *soon.* DM or post for my typos to get fixed. Tell me if I have something wrong.
