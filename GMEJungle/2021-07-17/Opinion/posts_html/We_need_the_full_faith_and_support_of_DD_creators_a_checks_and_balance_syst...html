<p>There's a lot of talk about having DD content creators as Mods and I absolutely agree.</p>
<p>You can be a Mod and not actually do any Mod duties. Let that sink in. DD mods can just be given a flair to provide credibility to the sub.</p>
<p>This would serve well for the sub because names like criand, atobitt, and others carry weight. Their reputation provides credibility because of their commitment to the movement from intensive, peer reviewed research.</p>
<p>I do not think I am alone for wanting this because their support in a subreddit would act as a seal of approval.</p>
<p>Should they ever leave, it would signal the sub has been compromised. Think of DD Mods as a checks and balances to the system for sub, admins, and mods. I believe this would create a safer place for all apes.</p>
<p>Now, its more important than ever as we approach the endgame. Who thinks this is good or bad?</p>
