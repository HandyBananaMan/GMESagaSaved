    "selftext": "I can tell you having some experience in \u201cpsychological operations\u201d that it is often used to force your opponent into making bad decisions based on their anger/frustration that results from their embarrassment/shame from the constant ridicule. \n\nFor those that say \u201che\u2019ll never see them\u201d you underestimate how narcissistic most people are. Even people we consider humble have no problem looking at photos of themselves, hearing stories about themselves, etc. \n\nPowerful people tend to be even more narcissistic than the average joe. So I don\u2019t doubt KG has seen some of these photoshops of himself. And the constant ridicule has a more powerful effect than you realize.  \n\nAlso, I get a chuckle out of them. Carry on.",
