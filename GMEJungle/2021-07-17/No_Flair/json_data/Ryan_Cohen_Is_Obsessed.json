He be watchin everything.\n\n\"In December 2012, desperately needing money to expand Chewy, his year-old pet-supply startup, Ryan Cohen traveled from Fort Lauderdale to Palo Alto and **walked into a half-dozen venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road unannounced.** He didn't get past the receptionists. **Three months later he tried the same tactic again.\"**\n\n\"Cohen, 31, is **compulsive about executing**, and about other things, too. **\"I have OCD,\"** he says--though he's never been diagnosed--while digging into a lunch of steamed salmon and vegetables at Chewy HQ. His diet is primarily two meals: steamed vegetables with fish or chicken. **He sleeps three hours a night, reading feedback on Chewy's Facebook page into the wee hours. Positive reviews, he says, \"give me goose bumps.\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: some old Forbes (they crusty) article",
