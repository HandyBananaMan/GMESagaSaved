Anytime atobitt is on That moMoney show I watch because I want to hear his DD. I\u2019ve become a huge fan and supporter of Criand. Fuck ELLIOT WAVES have me hyped up. I love watching Gherkin in the mornings as well. That is what I will follow. So if that comes here than great. If DD continues to be posted to SS then I\u2019ll read it there. You should too.",
