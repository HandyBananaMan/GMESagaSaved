    "selftext": "I originally posted this as a comment but it wasn\u2019t gaining any traction. Anyways:\n\nI have a suggestion for mods that people aren\u2019t seeming to understand me on superstonk.\n\nI believe all the mods should be given generic usernames on a new account once they become a mod. For example: x726dh and 2y273d. They will still have the mod badge so that users cannot pretend to be a mod in the comments.\n\nMy reasoning is that I don\u2019t like how mods have recognizable identifiable names. They serve a purpose they\u2019re not supposed to be friends with the sub.\n\nWhen mods have names like pinkcatsonacid (no offence pink) they begin to have a personality and an expectation of who they are and what they\u2019re like when you see the username.\n\nIf criand ever becomes mod I don\u2019t want him to be criand. I want him to be xh3hs62. I like his dd and see him as a trusted source, so I am bias towards him. If there\u2019s ever a disagreement amongst mods I may be bias in favour of criand and less objective (subconsciously).\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, and don\u2019t just say \u2018that doesn\u2019t make sense\u2019. I\u2019m saying give mods a serial number that\u2019s not easily memorized not let them pick cute and quirky memorable usernames",
