    "selftext": "At first Satori was quite succesful and I was surprised by the complexity of the requirements \n\nI had an old account u/MostLikelyHasADHD and I was active in GME and superstonk since January.  I deleted it for security reasons, was allowed back in GME obviously, but even after sending a message and meeting the karma requirements, new karma requirements were placed in and shills etc were still somehow beating this bot (especially recently ahem mod drama) \n\n\nI was never much use to the sub except for I can say moral, my smooth brain only knows how to sing, dance and act like an ape, but it sure does get the people going. \n\nI'm not even trying to play the victim like \"waaaa I didn't get in superstonk and I deserve to be in the sub\" \n\n\nIm just saying that Satori was good at first but eventually a failure due to sophisticated paid shills and infiltrators, and it also blocked all the real apes out. \n\n\nI understand karma requirements work well etc, but superstonk was too experimental.\n\n\n(Addition) I think it all went downhill with the trading 212 agreement, that's when I first noticed the signs, we need more security for this sub \nI mean that lego thing? Sure it was artistic and creative but literally our WHOLE feed was covered in them, how is that moderated lmao \n\n\nI'm not taking sides with any of the mods though I will say with candor that Pink seemed to act in the most professional way \n\n\n\nYa don't dip ya pen in the company ink\n\n\n\nEdit: I don't know why but my posts always seem to go well with the community, what the fuck is wrong with you apes im literally a fucking retard.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: while I believe Satori was not made with malicious intent, I like other users do question the transparency of said bot, can u/PinkCatsOnAcid maybe open up on this topic?",
