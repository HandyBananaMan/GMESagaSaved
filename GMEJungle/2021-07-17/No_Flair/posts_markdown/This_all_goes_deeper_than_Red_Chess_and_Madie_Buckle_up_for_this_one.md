TL,DR: There has been a coordinated infiltration attempt of the reddit communities surrounding retail trading and GME from Day 1. Madie was always sus but infiltrators rarely work alone. Redchessqueen99 clearly in on it. But the KING PIN seems to have been RENSOLE from DAY 1. A heavy accusation, yeah, but the evidence is mounting and with todays mod statement from Superstonk it continues to grow. And their plan almost worked if it hadn’t been for genuine actors like Pink.



I’ve been holding since late January, bought in the day before the false squeeze. And like many of you since then, I’ve been through a constant rollercoaster of emotions surrounding GME. I’ve read the DD and I’ve done my own research into how the financial system is all “supposed” to work. I’ve seen all the movies and documentaries that have become almost required reading. All of this in order to quell my anxieties surrounding what I know has to happen. Shorts must close. But while in the long run I feel comfortable believing this, the day to day isn’t always easy. And that’s why for me having place to go to read more and see memes and in general just know that I’m not a crazy conspirator on a desert island has been so important.  To have so much validation in the form of award winning journalists and people who have been writing about and fighting against HFT and Naked shorting their entire careers has been amazing. But it’s coming to light now that Superstonk and certain mods were compromised from day 1. And I hope this isn’t the only post you see today regarding this. 

I’ve been doing a lot of reading and digging yesterday and today because I’ve been awaiting anything from the mods in regards to the most recent blow up at Superstonk. And it’s come to my attention that almost 5 months ago there was a post in r/GME that goes pretty in depth about how infiltration happens and then questions the veracity of Rensole in a very logical manner with proof. And how he has been involved with Red from the beginning and they have always been covering for each other. 

Entire 3 part post is worth a read but part 2 is where it becomes less theory and more application:  [Superstonk is Sus Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mtyk40/superstonk_is_sus_an_investigation_into/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Now the post never gained much traction. And at the time it was in the midst of the second ape migration. But it shows through post histories and comments that you can see yourself that Rensole and Red have always been connected. Now this by itself is nothing. Many of us became involved in GME around the same time and thus started posting at the same time. But the post provides a fair line of questioning towards Rensole potentially being a fabricated//bought account. And reminds us that infiltration in reality, rarely occurs by a lone actor. If you’ve ever played a social deduction game you know that it’s always easier to be deceptive when you know there are other bad actors with you who can cover for you and deflect for you. Or simply take the heat for you in order to further and end goal. 

Rensole account coming out of hibernation suddenly. Explicit karma farming and establishing presence. Moderating Diamondtitties with Red. Leaving r/GME with Red. Screenshots of Red orchestrating an intentional migration in order to seize power. Rensole being instantly defensive about one comment about not being a real person, on livestream. And for me, the realization that maybe we shouldn’t have left r/GME. 

I thought we weren’t supposed to have celebrities. But for some reason no matter how un-excellent Rensole has behaved towards people as I’ve now combed through the comments and screenshots, he never seemed to get any heat that sticks. I looked forward to his Daily Stonks so much but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t been behaving nefariously on the sidelines.

And reading today’s mod statement only confirms for me what the Superstonk is Sus theory lays out. 

[Buckle the fuck up, new changes…](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omdh53/buckle_the_fuck_up_new_changes_in_the_moderating/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Red not being removed as a mod, Madie being given an essays worth of fluff to say “we’re not removing her or doing anything to her” and of course, no mention of Rensole or how he behaved during all of this. Along with promoting buttfarm69 to a mod which feels tone deaf considering the issue stems from too many mods too quickly. I believe buttfarm to be innocent in this but it seriously reads as a rushed populist election in order to quell discontent rather than address the real issues. And not to mention the continued downplaying of Red and mischaracterization of Pink.

I genuinely think their long play was to infiltrate reddit and then slowly pull the wool over our eyes. But they had to make it look legit and so needed to hire real mods alongside their team of plants. Yet they constantly tried to gaslight and undermine them all. They just never expected a Pink cat to take screenshots, document, and be a genuine actor who refused to back down.

Edit: Here’s another in depth look at this theory and all the evidence coming to light. Highly recommend reading it and seeing for yourself
