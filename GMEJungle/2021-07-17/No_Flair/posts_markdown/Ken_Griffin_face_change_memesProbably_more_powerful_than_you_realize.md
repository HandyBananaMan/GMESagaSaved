I can tell you having some experience in “psychological operations” that it is often used to force your opponent into making bad decisions based on their anger/frustration that results from their embarrassment/shame from the constant ridicule. 

For those that say “he’ll never see them” you underestimate how narcissistic most people are. Even people we consider humble have no problem looking at photos of themselves, hearing stories about themselves, etc. 

Powerful people tend to be even more narcissistic than the average joe. So I don’t doubt KG has seen some of these photoshops of himself. And the constant ridicule has a more powerful effect than you realize.  

Also, I get a chuckle out of them. Carry on.
