In fact, I could really care less about it. No offense Pink. The reason I came over, and maybe this is gonna be true for a few others too, is that I've had a nagging sensation that something hasn't been quite right over at SuperStonk for a few weeks now. 

I get it's important to keep shills out and at first Satori and the basic karma requirements worked as expected. Unfortunately, as was to be expected, the shills got more sophisticated and some shillery started coming through. 

Instead of working with the Satori team to improve it's filter the mods suddenly "decided" (were manipulated I think) to preemptively increase sub karma requirements "temporarily", leaving a bunch of us apes unable to post and many more unable to even comment. 

Now I may not have 8k karma, but I'm a January ape that boarded the ship back with air WSB, have been through all the previous migrations and plan to hold some of my beloved shares forever. 

Just because I don't post often doesn't mean I don't have something to say sometimes. These new karma restrictions on SuperStonk effectively silenced all us mostly lurker apes that like to periodically contribute to the GameStop conversation. And Satori took no notice of me, even with !apeprove!

Soon after the modified karma reqs, one of the top mods, I honestly don't remember who, posted an absolute ban on talking about the infinity pool. This is really when my üö®üö® started going off. This was the most sus thing in my mind and I never expected a SuperStonk mod to propose it, much less to so nonchalantly implement it. No heads up, no conversation. Straight up authoritarian.

The sub has honestly felt kinda dull since then, and I think that was part of the purpose of this whole psy-ops campaign that we just saw unwind.

1. Silence Apes
2. Bury mention of Infinity Pool (as close as they can get to destroying an idea)
3. Create serious mod drama through a well placed honeypot saboteur (one of many perhaps?)

The full purpose of all of this??

IMO to keep apes too distracted this weekend to question why the "temporary" karma requirements are now effectively permanent and why are our ideas being censored.

But who knows for sure how deep any of this goes. 

This is why I'm here. Because I needed to warn you all I think SuperStonk is more compromised than we think. It's not just the mod drama. Who knows how many mod decisions (many of which happen in the dark apparently) were influenced by Maddie and her tendrils. SuperStonk really needs a Bastille Day of it's own.

Don't get me wrong. I love SuperStonk and am ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π about its current state. I truly believe that as a sub, r/SuperStonk is a city on a hill. For a brief moment in time it was a beautiful utopia and I would really like to go back to that. But like all great cities it's being corrupted from within by cunning enemies through intrigue and deceit.

I can't wait to feel excited to pull up SuperStonk again, but until there's a place for all apes, until there's  transparency and until all apes can freely swim in the infinity pool as each individually decides to...

Until those things happen I'll be hanging here in the Jungle with all my fellow apes. 

Put out your dumpster fires r/SuperStonk and clean our your streets for the real ape festival: MOASS. 

Btw, have you apes heard of this thing called democracy? It's pretty neat and I think we should figure out how to implement it here.

In the meantime, Buy, Hold & Buckle Up! ü¶ßüöÄüåï
