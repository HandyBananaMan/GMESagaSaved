Will the real Apes please stand up.

  

Look  
 If you had  
 One shot at a MOASS  
 Or one opportunity  
 To seize everything from the billys  
 In one moment  
 Would you hold it  
 Or just paper hand it away?

Yo  
 Apes tits are sweaty, knees weak, diamond hands are heavy  
 There's Kennys on their sweaters already, DFV’s not a kitty.

Shorts nervous, but Apes are calm and ready  
 to drop DD bombs, but they keep forgettin

what they shorted down, the whole Reddit goes so loud

Kenny opens his mouth, and the shorts just keep on coming out

He's chokin', how, Reddit's jokin' on him now

The money’s about to run out, times up, it’s over, blaow.  
   
 

DTC needs to snap back to reality, ope there goes GME  
 Ope, there goes RC, Kenny choked  
 He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No  
 He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to the world now

It don't matter, he's a dope, he knows that, and he’s about broke

Market so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mansion home.

Now back to the Citadel again, yo, Hedge Funds being so flanigan

Better try to capture this moment and hope the Apes paper hand

You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment  
 Apes you own it, you better never let it go  
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit  
 This opportunity comes only once 

You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment  
 Apes own it, you better never let it go  
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit  
 This opportunity comes only once   
 You better hodl.

Apes souls are aching, through this red market that is gaping  
 This world is ours for the taking  
 Make us equal, as we move toward a Free Market in the making

A life without u/JTH1 Elliot Waves Guy is borin', r/SuperStonk is close to  post mortem 500k deep shill infiltrating with a titty pic. On to r/GMEjungle It only grows easier, diamond hands keep formin  
 Apes grow, it's all over, MSM thinks they onto them  
 Coast to coast shows, Reddits right and Ryan Cohen now known as the Apefather

Untraveled roads, u/Criand only knows, we’ve grown farther from January  
 We work and go home and never faulter.

But hold your shares cause the MOASS is near

Keith Gill opened our eyes and led the way here with a magic 8 ball and drinking some beer

These other hedge funds don't want retail no mo', u/Buttfarm69 with dank memes maken fear

They bankrupted moms and pops stores, moved onto the next without a care

So the soap opera of GameStop is told and u/HomeDepotHank DD unfolds,  
 Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da

You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment  
 Apes you own it, you better never let it go  
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit  
 This opportunity comes only once 

You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment  
 Apes own it, you better never let it go  
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit  
 This opportunity comes only once   
 Buckle up and light the rocket.

No more games, Butt Banana Guy making bets for days

We about to tear the motherfuckin’ roof off this cage

At first we was playin’ but now the mood is changing

Retail been chewed up as they tried to throw us off stage

But we keep on buyin and keep stepping into the next FTD cycle

Best believe u/rick_of_spades paid the piper

All the pain inside from Harambre and Geoffry amplified inside

Fact that some Apes cant get by with their nine to five and cant

Provide the right type of life for their ape family despite they try.

Its no movie yet, but when there is we won’t forget u/DerGurkenraspler

The Diamantenhande Guy, this is our life and these times can be hard.

Some days it feels even harder tryna feed and water this Reddit community seed, plus

Teeter totter, caught up with between Knights of New and being just a hodlr.  
 Shill drama, weekend 3AM lights on, screaming FUD on us
Mod drama got us moving to another sub.    
 Gotten us to the point, ticker moving like a snail we’ve got

gmefloor.com to formulate a moon shot

Success is our only motherfuckin option, paper handing is not.

Apes, I love you, and we’re not going anywhere. We CAN grow old and wait in Kenny’s Parking lot.

So here We go, this is our shot

Diamond hands, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity we got.  
 

You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment  
 Apes you own it, you better never let it go  
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit  
 This opportunity comes only once

You can do anything you set your mind to, Apes.




Its good to be here with you all, hope this makes someone laugh, it was a good way to buy some time today.
