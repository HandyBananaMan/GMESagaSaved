I've been seeing this more and more in the last few weeks... mods tagged ALL THE TIME.  Someone (Criand or Atobitt I believe) said the other day that they had 9,000 unopened messages.  Think about that.

"NEED AN ADULT" =/= NEED A MOD

We need DD and TA and financial smart people who research stuff on the regular to analyze DD,  not the mod team.   The mod team should be people who spend their time trying to make the sub streamlined, organized, safe, and accessible.  Content should be up to the apes.

Also... DD could have different types of secondary flair.  "Hypothetical" "inconclusive" "plausible" "confirmation bias" "TA" "debunked" "needs evidence" etc.
