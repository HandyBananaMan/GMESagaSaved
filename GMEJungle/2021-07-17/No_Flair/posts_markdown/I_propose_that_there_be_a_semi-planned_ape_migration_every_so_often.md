I think while this sub is still early in its lifespan, we should discuss this idea. 

I have followed this saga since early January and got skin in the game in late January. I had lurked W$B for years, but had taken about a year off trading when I caught onto GME. My other qualifications do not matter. I'm retarded, and I'm not even discussing financial advice.

I have noticed a trend, during and after sub splits. There was a period of a week or two between the W$B meltdown and when GME became the dominant sub for the hardcore apes. During this time, shills pretty much solely focused on W$B and we were left to freely explore ideas and memes in a collection of subs. This is when much of our DD foundation was laid (beyond DFV's value play and early MOASS theory). We then grew our numbers of apes significantly during the GME early days. Then we experienced a growth of shills there over a number of weeks and eventually succumbed to the pressure. 

Then we moved to superstork. The ape migration to superstork was one of the most impressive feats I have ever seen. A general consensus built over a few days that GME was compromised, we had a trigger event, and all followed Red and Rensole to superstork. The migration of a vast majority of OG, hardcore apes happened in about 48 hours. We were then granted the same kind of grace period we had during the migration from W$B. There were 2-4 weeks before shills arrived in earnest and needed to be combatted, as they were primarily focused on the bigger subs of W$B and now, GME. This allowed time for DD, memes, and discussion to flourish, and we did the migration much more efficiently. Then over the next couple of months, mods had to be added, automod had to go wild. We were sitting ducks for relentless siege. The pressure cooker intensified as more and more shills put their focus on superstork. We had a number of trigger events that *could* have taken us down, but didn't. Finally, a trigger event happens that can't be ignored, a consensus builds over a week or so that we need to do something, and then another trigger happens that gets us to follow pink here.

We are rapidly growing here, and my perception is that we are getting a similar grace period here. We may not be getting heavy DD yet, but rumor is is that criand is around, and I'm sure other DDers and new apes that followed superstork but couldn't post will now be able to contribute here (along with older subs if they still choose). We can cross-post to older subs and still multi publish DD and stellar memes. This gets the word out about the new sub to younger apes, who then follow the OGs. It's like the gallows "first time?" meme. We gotta show em how a migration is done, but we all figured it out, they can too. Our ability to quickly audible and communicate at lightning speeds is our greatest weapon. And for all the retard talk, we're all brilliant as fuck. You *have to be smart* to understand MOASS, so you can figure out where to go next. I believe in you. 

Therefore, I propose semi-planned ape migrations at certain intervals. This would be a way to shed our skin and keep growing productively. If we migrate every 4-5 weeks, we should be able to absolutely *THRIVE* in the "shillery grace period". I'm open to debate on this, but I believe MOASS *will* happen before FEB2022 when most shares become long term capital gains, so we don't want things to fester too long like we did with superstork, but my timeframe might be a little short as well, I dunno. We also want to give a certain amount of time for the shills to relocate en masse before pulling the swap. Then...if we keep reposting the best shit to old subs for younger and slower apes, they find the new location, can tell the quality of DD and memes are better (the OGs and new OGs are there, after all), and relocate themselves. Then the young apes become old apes and are able to transition much quicker on the next migration, making each successive migration easier.

Ideas for discussion:

-Timeframe for how often to migrate.

-Should there be any permanent rules between here and future main subs? (My opinion is no)

-Should there be any permanent mods/founders? (I see many pros and cons to each)

-If yes to the above, who?

-Anything else y'all want to discuss, bring it up, I've been typing too long on a cell phone.
