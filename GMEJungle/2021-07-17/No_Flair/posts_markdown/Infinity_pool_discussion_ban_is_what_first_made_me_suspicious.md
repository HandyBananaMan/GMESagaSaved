Not only did it come out of nowhere, the reasoning just straight-up didn't make any sense. We've been discussing it for months; if it actually, legally counted as "market manipulation", we'd have heard of impending lawsuits already. We didn't, because that's not how law anywhere works. You cannot sue hundreds of thousands of strangers for discussing one idea, at random times, in one forum.

Furthermore, if merely *discussing the possibility* of $infinity/share is market manipulation, why doesn't $35M/share (or whatever arbitrary number [gmefloor.com](https://gmefloor.com) is at now) count as market manipulation? Maybe the idea was capitalized on because someone in the mods noticed that price floors weren't being discussed as much as they used to be, so removing the idea of infinity from the conversation would make it easier to slowly build FUD and lower the average mental price target.

Either way, I couldn't understand it, and there was no mod follow-up to the many questions about it. And then Runic Glory woman refused to go to horny jail, so that was that.
