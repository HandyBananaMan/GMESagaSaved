#Title: I’m here for the community, not the mods. And honestly, I’m still slightly skeptical of pink just like I am all the other mods. But no amount of skepticism or drama will ever change the GME investment thesis.

So I never trusted any of the Superstonk mods to begin with. 

I don’t like to advertise it, but I’m pretty well versed with the market. Im previously series 6, and series 63 qualified but they have both long since expired. So anytime I read anyone’s post or comments, it’s easy for me to see just how much they actually understand and where they get lost. (Example. The TA from warden was trash and I could tell he misunderstood many things. That’s why I never kept up with him after reading his very first post. I was actually surprised when they started gaining popularity). 

Point is - like many of you - I have an excellent bullshit detector, and my background has helped me confirm many sketchy things here that initially only began as hunches. 

So let’s start with wallstreetbets. 

The exodus from wallstreetbets made sense. 

Shills came advertising AMC, RKT, SLV, and weed stocks as the next squeeze and posts about GME were slowly being removed. We slowly leaked over to /r/GME and found our new home. 


The move to Superstonk however, was sus af - felt out of nowhere and due to “mod drama”. Not to mention it was built by a team of mods with accounts less than 100 days old at the time. But it eventually was home again. 

Now I’m going to go into details and transparency on some of my suspicions. 


Pink: 

I went through post and comment history of all the mods months back and honestly pink was the least sus to me. The only concerns I had was why she wanted so much publicity from being a self proclaimed diamond whistleblower?  Did she have a motive and was she seeking the attention or genuinely trying to help spread awareness? She became a mod soon after and I remained intrigued towards her prerogative.

While she was a mod she debunked a post that wasn’t actually debunked - and when I posted a response with a counter point - she neglected to consider that or even respond to it and left the post marked as debunked, even though the community backed me and also wanted a response. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o6lcde/did_she_just_say_hedge_funds_short_stocks_through/h2uem4b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)

That was when I first got sus of her - but I considered maybe she just had a hard on for Lauer (who I’m also sus of for the record. I provided counter DD to a point he made later on regarding the same subject and he also refused to acknowledge it - while only answering the easy and non relevant comments / questions on his post). https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o70lid/dark_pools_price_discovery_and_short/h2x9ngr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3


Then, this drama happens and Pink was not transparent at all. I feel extremely bad for her for being threatened, but she was intentionally extremely vague which only added more drama to the sub than the truth would have. Why be so vague and not come out and clear everything right away? That’s suspicious as hell to me. It’s not evidence - but it’s suspicious and she has yet to explain why she chose to only half reveal things. 

Rensole:

For the record - While i always stay skeptical of everybody, rensole originally slowly grew on me at /GME. He would copy and paste all the posts I agreed with in his news posts and would omit the same ones I mentally ruled out. This led me to believe he had a pretty good bullshit detector. But the minute he posted that low floor post, that’s when my suspicions began. I was suspicious because even if that’s how he truly felt, he knew what kind of discourse and havoc that would bring to the sub - yet he still chose to do so. 
Not only that, but he responded to the criticism  in anger and bashed the community for their reaction. 

Later on after moving to Superstonk, he began shilling AMC on Twitter and even during the GME annual shareholders live stream - and that’s what sealed it for me on him. 

Red:

She came out of nowhere with a 70 day old account and seeking attention - so of course suspicious of her. When she got added as mod at GME there were posts like “yay red” like literally worshiping her and it’s like; where the fuck did this worshiping come from? Same when she got removed as mod. All I thought was why is this new ass account garnering this attention and acting like this? Fake it till you make it mantra in action?



I could go on but my point is…
The community is what this is all about. Each other. All of us and our peer to peer reviews and conversations being able to sort out the FUD together. . I don’t need to tell you guys not to trust anybody because we all already know. That’s how we found each other and that’s how we will always stay together through this. 


As always. Buy and hold. It’s really that easy. We all know that no matter what happens.
