I am back again asking someone with a wrinkle to fucking help me. I first stumbled across this two weeks ago. It was right before July fourth the post got some traction, but I never really found the answer I was looking for. Its been to weeks and we’ve got some more info so here we go.

\^first post 

***Trigger warning:*** First I am a crayon snorting pirate and I have fucking potatoes for brains. 2nd there will be other tickers mentioned so we can make a bigger comparison to try and figure out what the fuck is going on. 3rd Knights of new please do not kill this, please someone kill this with reason it has been bothering me for two weeks. 4th Yes, I am bringing dates and I know what just happened on 7-14 you better be ready to get hurt again. (If any of this is not for you leave now)

Let’s begin we are talking options **max strike prices**! Now the reason this has my attention is because if you are buying a max strike options, you are basically gambling on the most unlikely outcome to happen. For market makers that would be easy money. Like why not just take “Dumb Money” money? Just cash that moon bet and keep moving. 

When I made the first post 8-13 options existed but 8-27 did not. I noticed on 8-13 that the max strike prices just plummet. They are noticeably less, but why? Why not just take the money and run? Well, the best answer I found the first time was from an options mod who PM’d me to tell me 1- that I couldn’t post because of karma requirements. 2- that he believed the reason 8-13 was lower is because it was the most recent option mentioned. 

So, I waited two weeks to find out more, two weeks because 8-20 already existed cause it is a monthly option. So, when you see the (M) next to the below date those are monthly options and set out way earlier then weekly options. 

**1st GME –** We like this Stonk! (I noted when the max strike changed from original post. If not noted did not change. The \* are dates we are focusing on) 

**Original post was trading at about $200. Today closed at $169.04**

7-23- $680

7-30- $570

8-6 $440

8-13\* $217.50

8-20 (M) $680 

8-27\*\* $250 *(was not listed 7-2 original post, so why is the max strike higher then 8-13? Its not been out as long)* 

9-17 (M) $680

10-15(M) $680 

11-19 (M) $800

12-17(M) – *This existed when I wrote the original post. But this has disappeared according to both my Brooker and barchart. If anyone can find what this is currently go for it. Previously it was listed at $950*

1-21 (M) $950- *Now this has changed when I originally posted it was listed @ $680 now the max strike is $950*

This time I took it one step further. I started looking at the volume or each week. Idk how accurate stonk o tracker is, I’ve seen it referenced in this sub a few times, so I figured why not. Looking at the volume for both 8-13 and 8-27 the volume is just all together gone. Weirder part the volume for 8-13 is lower then 8-27 and 8-13 has been listed longer.

**2nd Motion picture**  **Stonk**

**Original post trading about $50, today closed @ $34.96**

7-23- $145

7-30- $125

8-6 $125 *(this did go up $5)* 

8-13\* $70 *(this went up $8.50)*

8-20 (M) $145

8-27\*\* $70 (wasn’t listed 7-2 original post)

9-17 (M) $145

**No Oct or Nov options listed, weren’t listed first post ether.** 

12-17 (M) $145

1-21 (M) $145

Again adding stonk O to see what’s going on with the volume. For Movie unlike game there is more of a balance with 8-13 having higher volume. But still the volume for both is still very low compared to some of the others.

For my first post it looked like the entire market was taking a dump on 8-13 with the max strike prices. Now it looks like things are shaping back up to normal except for meme stonks. Some things we have learned since the first post. 

1- Amzn was originally not listed at all on 8-13. Now its listed and has a normal max strike price. 

2- Tesla was brought up in first post. It had a major drop on the 13th originally but now the max price is up to $1000 on 8-13. The rest of the max strikes are $1375 currently trading @ $644.22

3- Its not a holiday week or end of the quarter. 

So now I started to specifically dig on shorted stonks. Cause it looked like mainstream ones were balancing out. What if there was like a vortex just sucking down the max strikes for shorted ones on 8-13. So I hoped on Ortex and looked at there last tweet and who they highlighted. 

**RKT** was mentioned didn’t find much here all max strikes go to $30. Also there best day was 3-2. 

**NOK** – nothing here, all strikes go to $9/$10 they did have a good day on 1-27 like game

**BBBY**\- Small change here it was going for $50 it takes a small dip at 8-13 to $45

But then I found some other interesting ones. 

**PLTR-** takes a dip from $40 to $33.50 on 8-13 then another dip on 8-27 to $30. They also had a good day 1-27. 

**BBerry** (trying to beat filter) gets interesting too and yes they had a good day on 1-27. 

7-23- $40

7-30- $32

8-6 $26

8-13\* $20

8-20 (M) $27

8-27\*\* $20

**Cl0V Leaf** ( trying to beat the filters) also interesting but there best day was June 8th. 

7-23- $43

7-30- $43

8-6 $29

8-13\* $19

8-20 (M) $43

8-27\*\* $15

***These other tickers are not FUD, I am simple trying to paint a bigger picture. I truly don’t understand what’s going on and I am hoping another ape sees this and can explain.*** 

**Summary:**

My original thoughts from the first post was that the entire market was showing a warning sign on 8-13 because of the max strike disappearing everywhere or it was some kind of glitch and everything would balance itself out. Now I think its even fucking weird that the “mainstream stonk” get back to normal but there is for sure something going on with both game and movie stonk on 8/13. It doesn’t make sense why those strikes wouldn’t be hire just to take dumb money from retail, right? Even weird that the next weekly behind it 8/27 has a higher max strike and hasn’t existed as long. Seems like someone really doesn’t want to get caught holding the bag on some moon bets that week. I also think some of the other “meme stonks” showing a “carter” (this is just what I’m calling it for the moment) in the 8/13 8/27 window is also weird. 

But I am high AF on crayons I snorted several boxes to the dome to make this post. So take it apart, tell me why I am wrong or what the fuck is going on or add on it. Just someone give me an answer as to why these max strikes just disappears and the volume is also gone for 8-13.
