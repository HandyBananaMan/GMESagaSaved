I originally posted this as a comment but it wasn’t gaining any traction. Anyways:

I have a suggestion for mods that people aren’t seeming to understand me on superstonk.

I believe all the mods should be given generic usernames on a new account once they become a mod. For example: x726dh and 2y273d. They will still have the mod badge so that users cannot pretend to be a mod in the comments.

My reasoning is that I don’t like how mods have recognizable identifiable names. They serve a purpose they’re not supposed to be friends with the sub.

When mods have names like pinkcatsonacid (no offence pink) they begin to have a personality and an expectation of who they are and what they’re like when you see the username.

If criand ever becomes mod I don’t want him to be criand. I want him to be xh3hs62. I like his dd and see him as a trusted source, so I am bias towards him. If there’s ever a disagreement amongst mods I may be bias in favour of criand and less objective (subconsciously).

Please let me know your thoughts, and don’t just say ‘that doesn’t make sense’. I’m saying give mods a serial number that’s not easily memorized not let them pick cute and quirky memorable usernames
