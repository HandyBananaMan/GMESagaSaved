I love you guys. It has nothing to do with the drama, its simple. We decided to vote them out, they ignored us and gave us bullshit excuses. Thats no community I want to be part of. I shall settle here. 

And bc I like my flair here :)

Edit: someone pointed out the no bashing from old sub thing, I agree. Just showing love for this new sub.
