Haven't read this before...I knew RC was tenacious but his sleeping three hours per night to read Chewy reviews gets me jacked. He be watchin everything.

"In December 2012, desperately needing money to expand Chewy, his year-old pet-supply startup, Ryan Cohen traveled from Fort Lauderdale to Palo Alto and **walked into a half-dozen venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road unannounced.** He didn't get past the receptionists. **Three months later he tried the same tactic again."**

"Cohen, 31, is **compulsive about executing**, and about other things, too. **"I have OCD,"** he says--though he's never been diagnosed--while digging into a lunch of steamed salmon and vegetables at Chewy HQ. His diet is primarily two meals: steamed vegetables with fish or chicken. **He sleeps three hours a night, reading feedback on Chewy's Facebook page into the wee hours. Positive reviews, he says, "give me goose bumps."**
