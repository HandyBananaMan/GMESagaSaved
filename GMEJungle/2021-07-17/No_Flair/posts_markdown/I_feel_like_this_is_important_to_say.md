What’s going on over at SuperStonk feels more like a combination of stress, shills, and egos. I’m here but I follow the DD. Anytime atobitt is on That moMoney show I watch because I want to hear his DD. I’ve become a huge fan and supporter of Criand. Fuck ELLIOT WAVES have me hyped up. I love watching Gherkin in the mornings as well. That is what I will follow. So if that comes here than great. If DD continues to be posted to SS then I’ll read it there. You should too.
