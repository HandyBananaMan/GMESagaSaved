<p>Yeah, it's easy to put trust in someone whose name we already recognize.  At first I thought Criand and Atobitt should be mods here.</p>
<p>But logically the proportion of bad  actors in that small population will be higher than the general population of early migrates who will have been trending towards the most active observers of the previous sub.  Shills have had months to develop credibility and it'd be foolish to believe there aren't at least a few sleepers who've been held back for an opportunity like this.  Probably at least 1 among those we respect the most.</p>
<p>Additionally, if we accept that there is always a chance of a bad actor slipping into a mod role, it will be easier to cope with and respond to the sketchy behavior of a relative unknown than someone we may want to implicitly give the benefit of the doubt just because we want to believe that we weren't wrong about them.</p>
