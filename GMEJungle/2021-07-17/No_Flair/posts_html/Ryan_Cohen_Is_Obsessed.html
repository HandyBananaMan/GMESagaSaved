<p>Haven't read this before...I knew RC was tenacious but his sleeping three hours per night to read Chewy reviews gets me jacked. He be watchin everything.</p>
<p>"In December 2012, desperately needing money to expand Chewy, his year-old pet-supply startup, Ryan Cohen traveled from Fort Lauderdale to Palo Alto and <strong>walked into a half-dozen venture capital firms on Sand Hill Road unannounced.</strong> He didn't get past the receptionists. <strong>Three months later he tried the same tactic again."</strong></p>
<p>"Cohen, 31, is <strong>compulsive about executing</strong>, and about other things, too. <strong>"I have OCD,"</strong> he says--though he's never been diagnosed--while digging into a lunch of steamed salmon and vegetables at Chewy HQ. His diet is primarily two meals: steamed vegetables with fish or chicken. <strong>He sleeps three hours a night, reading feedback on Chewy's Facebook page into the wee hours. Positive reviews, he says, "give me goose bumps."</strong></p>
