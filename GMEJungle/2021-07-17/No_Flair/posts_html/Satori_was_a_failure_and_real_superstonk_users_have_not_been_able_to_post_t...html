<h1>Title: Satori was a failure and real superstonk users have not been able to post there for ages while shills and terrible memes took up all the space instead of DD and positive energy.</h1>

<p>At first Satori was quite succesful and I was surprised by the complexity of the requirements </p>
<p>I had an old account u/MostLikelyHasADHD and I was active in GME and superstonk since January.  I deleted it for security reasons, was allowed back in GME obviously, but even after sending a message and meeting the karma requirements, new karma requirements were placed in and shills etc were still somehow beating this bot (especially recently ahem mod drama) </p>
<p>I was never much use to the sub except for I can say moral, my smooth brain only knows how to sing, dance and act like an ape, but it sure does get the people going. </p>
<p>I'm not even trying to play the victim like "waaaa I didn't get in superstonk and I deserve to be in the sub" </p>
<p>Im just saying that Satori was good at first but eventually a failure due to sophisticated paid shills and infiltrators, and it also blocked all the real apes out. </p>
<p>I understand karma requirements work well etc, but superstonk was too experimental.</p>
<p>(Addition) I think it all went downhill with the trading 212 agreement, that's when I first noticed the signs, we need more security for this sub 
I mean that lego thing? Sure it was artistic and creative but literally our WHOLE feed was covered in them, how is that moderated lmao </p>
<p>I'm not taking sides with any of the mods though I will say with candor that Pink seemed to act in the most professional way </p>
<p>Ya don't dip ya pen in the company ink</p>
<p>Edit: I don't know why but my posts always seem to go well with the community, what the fuck is wrong with you apes im literally a fucking retard.</p>
<p>Edit 2: while I believe Satori was not made with malicious intent, I like other users do question the transparency of said bot, can u/PinkCatsOnAcid maybe open up on this topic?</p>
