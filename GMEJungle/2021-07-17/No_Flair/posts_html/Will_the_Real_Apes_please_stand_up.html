<p>Will the real Apes please stand up.</p>
<p>Look<br />
 If you had<br />
 One shot at a MOASS<br />
 Or one opportunity<br />
 To seize everything from the billys<br />
 In one moment<br />
 Would you hold it<br />
 Or just paper hand it away?</p>
<p>Yo<br />
 Apes tits are sweaty, knees weak, diamond hands are heavy<br />
 There's Kennys on their sweaters already, DFV’s not a kitty.</p>
<p>Shorts nervous, but Apes are calm and ready<br />
 to drop DD bombs, but they keep forgettin</p>
<p>what they shorted down, the whole Reddit goes so loud</p>
<p>Kenny opens his mouth, and the shorts just keep on coming out</p>
<p>He's chokin', how, Reddit's jokin' on him now</p>
<p>The money’s about to run out, times up, it’s over, blaow.  </p>
<p>DTC needs to snap back to reality, ope there goes GME<br />
 Ope, there goes RC, Kenny choked<br />
 He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No<br />
 He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to the world now</p>
<p>It don't matter, he's a dope, he knows that, and he’s about broke</p>
<p>Market so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mansion home.</p>
<p>Now back to the Citadel again, yo, Hedge Funds being so flanigan</p>
<p>Better try to capture this moment and hope the Apes paper hand</p>
<p>You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment<br />
 Apes you own it, you better never let it go<br />
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit<br />
 This opportunity comes only once </p>
<p>You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment<br />
 Apes own it, you better never let it go<br />
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit<br />
 This opportunity comes only once <br />
 You better hodl.</p>
<p>Apes souls are aching, through this red market that is gaping<br />
 This world is ours for the taking<br />
 Make us equal, as we move toward a Free Market in the making</p>
<p>A life without u/JTH1 Elliot Waves Guy is borin', r/SuperStonk is close to  post mortem 500k deep shill infiltrating with a titty pic. On to r/GMEjungle It only grows easier, diamond hands keep formin<br />
 Apes grow, it's all over, MSM thinks they onto them<br />
 Coast to coast shows, Reddits right and Ryan Cohen now known as the Apefather</p>
<p>Untraveled roads, u/Criand only knows, we’ve grown farther from January<br />
 We work and go home and never faulter.</p>
<p>But hold your shares cause the MOASS is near</p>
<p>Keith Gill opened our eyes and led the way here with a magic 8 ball and drinking some beer</p>
<p>These other hedge funds don't want retail no mo', u/Buttfarm69 with dank memes maken fear</p>
<p>They bankrupted moms and pops stores, moved onto the next without a care</p>
<p>So the soap opera of GameStop is told and u/HomeDepotHank DD unfolds,<br />
 Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da</p>
<p>You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment<br />
 Apes you own it, you better never let it go<br />
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit<br />
 This opportunity comes only once </p>

 Buckle up and light the rocket.</p>
<p>No more games, Butt Banana Guy making bets for days</p>
<p>We about to tear the motherfuckin’ roof off this cage</p>
<p>At first we was playin’ but now the mood is changing</p>
<p>Retail been chewed up as they tried to throw us off stage</p>
<p>But we keep on buyin and keep stepping into the next FTD cycle</p>
<p>Best believe u/rick_of_spades paid the piper</p>
<p>All the pain inside from Harambre and Geoffry amplified inside</p>
<p>Fact that some Apes cant get by with their nine to five and cant</p>
<p>Provide the right type of life for their ape family despite they try.</p>
<p>Its no movie yet, but when there is we won’t forget u/DerGurkenraspler</p>
<p>The Diamantenhande Guy, this is our life and these times can be hard.</p>
<p>Some days it feels even harder tryna feed and water this Reddit community seed, plus</p>
<p>Teeter totter, caught up with between Knights of New and being just a hodlr.<br />
 Shill drama, weekend 3AM lights on, screaming FUD on us
Mod drama got us moving to another sub.  <br />
 Gotten us to the point, ticker moving like a snail we’ve got</p>
<p>gmefloor.com to formulate a moon shot</p>
<p>Success is our only motherfuckin option, paper handing is not.</p>
<p>Apes, I love you, and we’re not going anywhere. We CAN grow old and wait in Kenny’s Parking lot.</p>
<p>So here We go, this is our shot</p>
<p>Diamond hands, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity we got.  </p>
<p>You better yolo yourself in the market, the moment<br />
 Apes you own it, you better never let it go<br />
 You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to orbit<br />
 This opportunity comes only once </p>
