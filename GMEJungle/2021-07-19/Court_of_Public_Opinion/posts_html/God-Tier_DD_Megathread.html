<p>Happy new trading week, Apes! </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am working today on compiling a list of all the essential God-Tier DDs to keep stickied to the top of the sub. Please drop a comment below with a link to any DD that you feel should be included on this list! </p>

<p>Remember the purpose of this, first and foremost, is to educate new visitors to our subreddit with an easily accessible sticky note full of DD. (I will compile the final list from this suggestion thread.)</p>

<p>Thanks for your help in making educ-ape-tion a priority! ü¶çü§ùüí™</p>
