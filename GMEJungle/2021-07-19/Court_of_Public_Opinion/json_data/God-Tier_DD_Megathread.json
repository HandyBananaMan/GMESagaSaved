Please drop a comment below with a link to any DD that you feel should be included on this list! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpxqo2sdc6c71.jpg?width=538&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8529c9a4ae1600f549543ea05c5acb6d4f380bc\n\nRemember the purpose of this, first and foremost, is to educate new visitors to our subreddit with an easily accessible sticky note full of DD. (I will compile the final list from this suggestion thread.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help in making educ-ape-tion a priority! \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udcaa",
