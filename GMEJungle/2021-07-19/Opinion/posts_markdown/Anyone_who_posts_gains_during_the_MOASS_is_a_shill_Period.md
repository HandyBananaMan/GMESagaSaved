I think us individual investors need to make it clear to not post gains during MOASS. We’re ALL going to have insane percentages popping up on our account, so guess what? No one gives a shit about your percentages. Posting gains will entice others to think “you know what, maybe I should sell some of my shares just to be safe”. This thing will not work unless we HODL. 

ALSO, be prepared for crazy dips (e.g., $10,000 to $5,000, $500,000 to $250,000). After these dips, it’s obvious gains will start popping up saying, “lOok hOW MuCH mOnEY I mAdE HEHE”. Shills. Every single one of them. We know the heights this thing can go, don’t settle for less than we deserve (felt like Allstate right there).

If you think last week was bad, wait till this thing starts. 

Diamond hands fuckers.
