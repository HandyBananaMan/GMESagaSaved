    "selftext": "I think us individual investors need to make it clear to not post gains during MOASS. We\u2019re ALL going to have insane percentages popping up on our account, so guess what? No one gives a shit about your percentages. Posting gains will entice others to think \u201cyou know what, maybe I should sell some of my shares just to be safe\u201d. This thing will not work unless we HODL. \n\nALSO, be prepared for crazy dips (e.g., $10,000 to $5,000, $500,000 to $250,000). After these dips, it\u2019s obvious gains will start popping up saying, \u201clOok hOW MuCH mOnEY I mAdE HEHE\u201d. Shills. Every single one of them. We know the heights this thing can go, don\u2019t settle for less than we deserve (felt like Allstate right there).\n\nIf you think last week was bad, wait till this thing starts. \n\nDiamond hands fuckers.",
