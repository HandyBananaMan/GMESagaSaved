<p>So expecting a sweet dip last week i had transfered money to my schwab account. On that I have both an individual trading account and a roth ira account. I transferred the money to the roth to have those sweet tax free gains on gme. Well the roth is technically the secondary account on the settings when buying shares</p>
<p>You can guess what happened.. I accidentally bought the shares on my individual account and realized it after the purchase. So I had positive net cash with both accounts but a negative in the individual trading account. I refuse to be on margin in any capacity so I had to make a decision. </p>
<p>My options.
A: transfer money from roth to individual
B: send more money to individual account
C: sell gme on individual and buy it back on roth</p>
<p>I didn't want A cause taking money out of a roth can cause issues and it's best to just not do that.</p>
<p>B would've taken atleast a day and that just wasnt acceptable.</p>
<p>So i started looking at the gme shares in the individual account (note I already had shares in that account). I typed in the amount I purchased looked at the dreaded sell button but I just couldn't do it. These were my shares now. Why would I give them back... My precious..</p>
<p>So I went with option D:</p>
<p>I looked at everything else i owned on the individual account and just started selling until I was positive again. Liquidated every other stock I had on that account. I had some fond memories with them. Years of gains. Companies I grew up on...but it had to be done. Another day after the moass i may see them again but not till.</p>
<p>So yeah I can't even sell shares I accidentally bought and only owned for one minute. I guess I really am buckled up.</p>
