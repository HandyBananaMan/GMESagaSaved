<p>I didnâ€™t have the time nor want to spend my time figuring out what happened with the mods at SS but I did notice something interesting. </p>
<p>About the same number of people (50-60k) joined this sub in the first 24 hours as the move from WSB to GME and then again from GME to SS. </p>
<p>Is it the same 50-60k people that have followed the DD since then? Maybe not entirely but I think a large portion of it very well could be. </p>
<p>Holding since January and will continue to hold until I pass out from jubilation at my E*TRADE and Webull account balancesâ€”and then Iâ€™ll hold longer once I gain composure again during the MOASS. ðŸ’Ž ðŸ™Œ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸ’Ž ðŸ™Œ</p>
