Yeaa I\u2019m so lucky I read 100\u2019s of pages of DD, learnt all about a financial institute I never had a clue about 7 months ago. \nHeld through countless FUD and shill attacks, on numerous different subs! \nHad to convince loved ones I shouldn\u2019t paperhand through the lows and the highs for months on end. \nThen when MOASS finally came I had the diamond coated bollocks to hold all the way up to 40+mil per share so all shareholders no matter how small could be free for life. \nLuck doesn\u2019t come into it.",
