i’ve been a longtime lurker on r/superstonk and have diamond handed since january and   40x’ed my position in may. 

you don’t to need to know my whole fucking life story like some idiot dipshit mod, but just know i’m a director at a very large tech company, still type in all lowercase, get frustrated at smoothbrains and their lack of intelligence, but still like the stock.

the double downs are sound and my tits are jacked. for all the x apes out there, i gotchu.

let’s fucking go.

edit: you know which mod i’m referring to, love you u/pinkcatsonacid
