This comment is going to drive me bananas after MOASS. Yeaa I’m so lucky I read 100’s of pages of DD, learnt all about a financial institute I never had a clue about 7 months ago. 
Held through countless FUD and shill attacks, on numerous different subs! 
Had to convince loved ones I shouldn’t paperhand through the lows and the highs for months on end. 
Then when MOASS finally came I had the diamond coated bollocks to hold all the way up to 40+mil per share so all shareholders no matter how small could be free for life. 
Luck doesn’t come into it.
