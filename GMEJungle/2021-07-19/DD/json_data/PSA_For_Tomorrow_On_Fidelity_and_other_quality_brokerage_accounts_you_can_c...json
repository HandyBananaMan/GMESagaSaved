    "selftext": "For myself I personally know that Fidelitie's desktop app allows you to choose which market to place your stock purchases through. As it's been shown by a Redditor with a Bloomberg terminal access and another user they showed from the order number of the purchase it went right into the darkpool for trading, not affecting the price at all.\n\nThis is one of the top tricks Citadel has been using to keep the price down. Buys (that bring up the price up) go through DP's which don't affect the price, while sells go through regular markets. Last friday there was a 7:1 Buy/Sell ratio on Fidelity for GME. Imagine how much accurate amount of sales shown would affect the actual price.\n\nTheir guide for Directed Trading is here: [https://www.fidelity.com/products/atbt/help/ActiveTraderTools\\_Trade\\_Help.html#availableroutes](https://www.fidelity.com/products/atbt/help/ActiveTraderTools_Trade_Help.html#availableroutes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe sure to spread the word. This should be mentioned as much if not more than shorts must cover, MOASS is inevitable, mayo jokes, anything that happened to you is a bullish sign, Buy and HODL mantra and other regular thread filler comments.\n\nKnowing how to actively fight against strategies will put a lot more pressure as the value will be harder and harder to supress when so much buy volume is just hidden away in t+21 & t+35 blocks where they wait to buy the purchased stock at a lower price from when it was place. **Your order may actually negatively affect the price to move downwards with this fuckery.**\n\nLet's not just wait for MOASS, let's make it happen",
