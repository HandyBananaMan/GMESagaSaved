    "selftext": "I had a comment about dtc 009, effecting the t21 cycle, that got some attention. So I wanted to make a post, since I can here, about the obvious connection most people seemed to miss. \n\nIt all seemed so great of a fit with Ryan Cohen tweeting on a schedule. Everyone was convinced. So they did a rug pull. I believe the rule passing allowed them to disprove and discredit this angle of our dangle. But the shills made it seem like we were just wrong about the cycles.\n\nI disagree. \n\nIt is no coincidence to me that when dtc 009 went into effect on 6/23 then the very next t21 flopped on 6/24. With the verbiage of allowing themselves to do whatever they want. Regardless of 3rd party input.\n\nMaybe someone with more wrinkles could verify.\n\nLink to 009: shorturl.at/uwxCG\n\nHow I read it: \"DTCC can extend any deadline, for anything, at any time.\" \nSeems like that should obviously include any kind of delivery date.",
