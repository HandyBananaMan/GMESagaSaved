I had a comment about dtc 009, effecting the t21 cycle, that got some attention. So I wanted to make a post, since I can here, about the obvious connection most people seemed to miss. 

It all seemed so great of a fit with Ryan Cohen tweeting on a schedule. Everyone was convinced. So they did a rug pull. I believe the rule passing allowed them to disprove and discredit this angle of our dangle. But the shills made it seem like we were just wrong about the cycles.

I disagree. 

It is no coincidence to me that when dtc 009 went into effect on 6/23 then the very next t21 flopped on 6/24. With the verbiage of allowing themselves to do whatever they want. Regardless of 3rd party input.

Maybe someone with more wrinkles could verify.

How I read it: "DTCC can extend any deadline, for anything, at any time." 
Seems like that should obviously include any kind of delivery date.
