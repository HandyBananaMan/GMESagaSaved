<p>They're dropping like a stone.  Down 10% since fri close.  I just watched it drop another 3.2% in 45 min...</p>
<p>I could have sworn I read a comment last week that said if it drops under 1.2 we're gonna really see some fireworks...</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>UPDATE : as of 7/20/21 9:05am, continuing to slide...<br />
It's at $1.156 (down -2.12 since close)</p>
