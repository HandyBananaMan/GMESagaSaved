They're dropping like a stone.  Down 10% since fri close.  I just watched it drop another 3.2% in 45 min...

I could have sworn I read a comment last week that said if it drops under 1.2 we're gonna really see some fireworks...

Any thoughts?

UPDATE : as of 7/20/21 9:05am, continuing to slide...  
It's at $1.156 (down -2.12 since close)
