<h1>0. TLDR</h1>
<p>I created a <a href="https://verymeticulous.github.io/wikAPEdia/">website</a> for <a href="https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia">wikAPEdia</a> - an archive of GME DD, relevant information, resources, and more. <strong>The website is currently in beta and I am looking for feedback and suggestions on how to improve this resource.</strong></p>
<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>I have been compiling, organizing, and archiving relevant GME content in Github since early 2021.</p>
<p>Thanks to you brilliant apes, I have been able to start creating common themes and compilations of due diligence for easier accessibility like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/oo4lxz/deep_fucking_due_diligence_compilation_of/">Deep Fucking Due Diligence</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/oeu3gi/deep_fucking_resources_compilation_of_tools/">Resources</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/occ8j7/wealth_management_dd_compilation/">Wealth Management</a>, and now this website.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For new and curious apes that stumble upon wikAPEdia</em>, I encourage you to read the content from the linked source at the top of each file. <em>This resource would not have been able to be created if it weren't for the many intelligent apes who have worked tirelessly to create and share their learnings.</em> <strong><em>They deserve your upvote!</em></strong></p>
