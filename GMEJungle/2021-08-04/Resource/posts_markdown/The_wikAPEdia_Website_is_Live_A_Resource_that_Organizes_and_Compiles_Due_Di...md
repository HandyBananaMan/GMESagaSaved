# 0. TLDR

I created a [website](https://verymeticulous.github.io/wikAPEdia/) for [wikAPEdia](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia) \- an archive of GME DD, relevant information, resources, and more. **The website is currently in beta and I am looking for feedback and suggestions on how to improve this resource.**

# 1. Overview

I have been compiling, organizing, and archiving relevant GME content in Github since early 2021.

Thanks to you brilliant apes, I have been able to start creating common themes and compilations of due diligence for easier accessibility like [Deep Fucking Due Diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/comments/oo4lxz/deep_fucking_due_diligence_compilation_of/), [Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/oeu3gi/deep_fucking_resources_compilation_of_tools/), [Wealth Management](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/occ8j7/wealth_management_dd_compilation/), and now this website.

**Note**

>*For new and curious apes that stumble upon wikAPEdia*, I encourage you to read the content from the linked source at the top of each file. *This resource would not have been able to be created if it weren't for the many intelligent apes who have worked tirelessly to create and share their learnings.* ***They deserve your upvote!***
