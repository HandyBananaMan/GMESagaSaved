<p>You may think your one share buy dosen't make a difference, but if everybody thinks like that, well.. Your buys probably won't contribute to the price discovery. I know many apes before me have suggested it, but I feel like most people seem to forget to do it, mainly due to their broker's interface.</p>
<p>If you broker dosent allow routing your buys through IEX, I would urge you to call them. Most of the time they are able to do it over the phone.</p>
<p>Many people are raging at the darkpool activity, and are still not doing everything they can to avoid it as much as possible on their own side. Call your broker, dont give up. Remember how apes all over the world forced brokers to give them the chance to vote? Well, there's your motivation.</p>
<p>Be the change you wish to see. </p>
<p>If anybody could comment with their own broker and experience with routing through IEX, I will gladly update this post to spread more information about it.</p>

<p>Edit: 
Saxo Bank offers IEX routing, However you probably have to call them. I believe Saxo Bank is available to most of the World.</p>
<p>Fidelity: u/digi-transformation suggested routing through ARCX. Should be the way to go if you ask him. Waiting for more wrinkle brains to chip in. Sources: http://help.tradestation.com/09_05/eng/tradestationhelp/routes/arcx_exchange.htm
You can also comment on this thread to encourage them to allow IEX routing https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/oxyxe2/this_morning_gary_gensler_admitted_retail_buying/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</p>
<p>As u/Datachire said, you can download their Active Trader Pro app and route your buys through NYSE. This (Words from u/Datachire should be almost as reliable as IEX.</p>
<p>Edit: Interactive Brokers (IB) should allow you to route through IEX. Call them if you are in doubt on how to.
Please someone confirm in comments on how to.</p>
<p>Edit: TD Ameritrade should offer routing through IEX. Guide is found here: You may think your one share buy dosen't make a difference, but if everybody thinks like that, well..
