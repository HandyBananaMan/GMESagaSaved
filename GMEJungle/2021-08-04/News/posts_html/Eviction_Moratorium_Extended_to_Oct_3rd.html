<p>So the CDC has passed an extension to the eviction moratorium that will last until October 3rd. They're using the spread of the Covid Delta variant as the reason for the extension. Apparently, the Biden administration expects it to be contested in court, but they thought it was worth a try.</p>
<p>Also, there's more than $46 billion that's been already approved by Congress for emergency rental assistance. Does anyone know if this will be coming out of the $555B left over in the Federal checkbook?</p>
<p>While this is expected to help renters, it doesn't seem like it's going to do very much for homeowners, so we may still see a massive increase in mortgage defaults and foreclosures.</p>
