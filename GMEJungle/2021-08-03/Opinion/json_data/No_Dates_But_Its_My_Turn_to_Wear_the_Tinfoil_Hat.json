Over the past week, his Twitter (@eviljordan) has shown lots of photos from a vacation, and he tweeted that he just got home from the airport. (@Cyberhorsey is a software engineer at GameStop)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the theory:\n\nJordan completed the NFT project with the original 7/14 timeline in mind, then the launch date got pushed to 8/4 with the Ethereum fork delay. Since Jordan's team was already done, this was his chance to take a break from work, returning on 8/4 for the launch. (Though now I'm seeing that it was possibly delayed until 8/5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know if this has any implications or if it's even true, but it was my turn to wear the tinfoil hat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee you on the moon!\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. I know very little about how NFTs work. Just a smoothie here trying to put some pieces together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: thank you for the undeserved awards!\n\nEdit 2: I had to fix some formatting issues with the image. Hopefully everything is fine.",
