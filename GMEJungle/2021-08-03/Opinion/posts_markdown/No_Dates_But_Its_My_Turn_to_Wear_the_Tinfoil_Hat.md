Jordan Holberg is the principal engineer at GameStop. Over the past week, his Twitter (@eviljordan) has shown lots of photos from a vacation, and he tweeted that he just got home from the airport. (@Cyberhorsey is a software engineer at GameStop)

Here's the theory:

Jordan completed the NFT project with the original 7/14 timeline in mind, then the launch date got pushed to 8/4 with the Ethereum fork delay. Since Jordan's team was already done, this was his chance to take a break from work, returning on 8/4 for the launch. (Though now I'm seeing that it was possibly delayed until 8/5)

I don't know if this has any implications or if it's even true, but it was my turn to wear the tinfoil hat.

See you on the moon!

p.s. I know very little about how NFTs work. Just a smoothie here trying to put some pieces together.

Edit: thank you for the undeserved awards!

Edit 2: I had to fix some formatting issues with the image. Hopefully everything is fine.
