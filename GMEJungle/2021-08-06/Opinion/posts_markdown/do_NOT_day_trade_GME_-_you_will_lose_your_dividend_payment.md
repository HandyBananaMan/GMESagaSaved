I believe the GameStop NFT dividend will be the endgame.  If you sell shares after the dividend is announced, you might NOT be eligible to receive the GameStop NFT.  On the dividend announcement date, they will also announce the record date.  The record date is the day which your shares will be accounted for, for the dividend payment.

After the dividend is announced, chances are GME will go up.  If you sell before the record date, you WILL lose the dividend payment.

When you sell XX shares from your pool of XXX shares, you don't choose which shares you are selling.  They could automatically sell your oldest shares instead of the newly purchased one. This could render you ineligible for the GameStop dividend.

Edit: Depending on your broker, your stocks could be FIFO (First in First out) or LIFO (Last in First out).  Either way, BUY AND HODL ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Final Edit: Wow, this blew up a little.  This is NOT financial advice. ook ook.

I am working on a short DD, which points to a GameStop NFT dividend.
