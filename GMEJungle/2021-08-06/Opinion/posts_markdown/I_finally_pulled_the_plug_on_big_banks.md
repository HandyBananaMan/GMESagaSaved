I've been thinking about it for months, but today was finally the day. Good bye Wells Fargo, I'm now a proud member of a credit union.

It'll take some time to transfer and close everything but it's well worth it.

I also applied for their credit card. It's the first step in ditching my Amazon rewards card that pushes me to buy everything on Amazon for the high rewards. GameStop well be getting more of my future purchases.

Fuck big banks and big finance. I may not be rich (yet), but I can still do my part by refusing to do business with shitty companies.
