Yes, it comes off to be aggressive and sarcastically insulting, but I did this deliberately in hopes to get the public to start a real discussion on a logical approach to the situation. I never made it through college as I\u2019m a alternative learner in nature but my approach apparently is a thing called LOGOS (thank you internet) see below,\n\nLOGOS is a rhetorical or persuasive appeal to the audience's logic and rationality. Examples of logos can be found in argumentative writing and persuasive arguments, in addition to literature and poetry (blah blah blah big words and stuff)\n\nAlso: I want to thank everyone for the kind awards and all comments no matter if we agree or disagree. Let\u2019s just try to keep this discussion going. Sometimes it\u2019s best to look for the easiest solution to solving a problem first. This is where my Keep It Simple Stupid approach to using DRS as a solution to get the shorts to start covering comes in to play here. Thanks in advance for reading my post.\n\n\nHELLO MY FELLOW RETARDS** AND ***FUCK OFF TO YOU FLOATING FUDDERS AND SHILLS!!!***\n\nHERE'S A SIMPLE, EASY TO READ POST WITH THE INFORMATION COMING DIRECTLY FROM COMPUTERSHARE ABOUT ***GAMESTOP'S DIRECT STOCK PURCHASE PLAN***.\n\nIN MY OWN OPINION, ANYONE WHO ISN'T BUYING STOCK DIRECTLY FROM ***GAMESTOP'S DIRECT STOCK PURCHASE PLAN*** TRULY IS A FUCKING MORON AND I WILL PRAY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOUR IQ ISN'T GOING ANY HIGHER ANYTIME SOON.\n\n**HERE'S SOME EASY Q&A SO BUCKLE THE FUCK UP.**\n\n**Q:** CAN INTERNATIONAL APES PARTICIPATE?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[HEY LOOK \ud83d\udc40 INTERNATIONAL APES CAN BUY GAMESTOP STONKS DIRECTLY!!!](https://preview.redd.it/81brtv61irf71.jpg?width=2906&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddb0a3e34dec22b004a44a102c7cef7091d968a3)\n\n**A:** YES!!!

THEY HAVE NO SOUL AND ARE TOO GREEDY.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** NOTHING IN THIS POST IS FINANCIAL ADVICE AND SHOULDN'T BE CONSTRUED AS SO. I'M MOSTLY HIGH AND HAVE A VERIFIABLE IQ OF 40 THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. I ALSO TAKE LOT'S OF CALCULATED RISKY DECISIONS SO I'VE WON SOME AND LOST SOME. THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FUCKING EDUCATION ABOUT SOME FACTS AND THE REST IS MY OWN, INDIVIDUAL, PERSONAL OPINION. ***EVERYONE SHOULD DECIDE ON THEIR OWN WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THEM.*** I'M NOT SAYING PULL ALL OF YOUR SHIT OUT OF YOUR BROKERS EITHER. I'M PERSONALLY HEAVILY DIVERSIFIED WITH MANY DIFFERENT BROKERS BUT ***MY HEAVIEST POSITION IS HELD WITH DRS SHARES AT COMPUTERSHARE (BECAUSE I'M EITHER FUCKING RIGHT OR MOSTLY NOT WRONG).*** I ALSO PLAN ON KEEPING SOME OF MY SHARES ALL THROUGHOUT THE MOASS FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS.
