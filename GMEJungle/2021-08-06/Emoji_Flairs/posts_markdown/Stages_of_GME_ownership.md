Stage 1: “GameStop is great and as a bonus, fuck you HFs

Stage 2: “holy shit, I knew the system was corrupt but this is ridiculous”

Stage 3: “oh ok, you pieces of shit aren’t even bothering to hide it anymore!?  Good thing GME is the most solid investment on the market right now”

Step 4: “FUCK. YOU.  Not only am I not selling at xx,xxx,xxx, I’m not selling period. I will buy more of the stock I like at every opportunity and keep it until there ISN’T a stock market anymore”
