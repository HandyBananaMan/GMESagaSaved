Hey guys,

So Charlie recently posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFi-gWysLlg)

The whole thing seems weird so I dug into Kestra Advisory services a bit more and found [this](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/ia-5770.pdf)

&#x200B;

Also, their portfolio value on Fintel is insane:

I don't know much about SEC filings, but this seems like a red flag when you combine it with the info from Charlieâ€™s video.

IDK, could be nothing, could be something, just thought I would share.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

Okay so digging into their portfolio value a bit more I found this:

a 3 TRILLION $ gain in the last 12 months? huh?

Further, if you do a general google search for these guys they are reported to have a holding of only $34 Billion. What is going on?

Their Fintel portfolio value seems legit, they have a lot of big holdings: [look here](https://fintel.io/i/kestra-advisory-services-llc)

Who the fuck are these guys??

Also thanks u/_writ for finding [this](https://wallmine.com/fund/4tt/kestra-advisory-services-llc)

More evidence that they have a portfolio of 8 trilli

&#x200B;

**ANOTHER EDIT:**

Okay so the CEO of Kestra Advisory Services, LLC is **JAMES LYNN POER** [LINK](https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/1983357)

If we follow his records we see that he used to work for something called KESTRA **INVESTMENT** SERVICES, LLC - Nice

A quick search for 'Kestra Investment Services LLC' and I find [this](https://www.investorlawyers.com/kestra-investment-services.html)

&#x200B;

These guys are shady as fuck.

&#x200B;

lol

&#x200B;

Remember, this was all under the name Kestra **Investment** Services, not Kestra **Advisory** Services.

So they did a whole bunch of illegal shit and then just changed their name a lil.

&#x200B;

[Here is even more shady shit done under the KIS name.](https://www.sonnlaw.com/investigations/kestra-investment-history-regulatory-sanctions/)

&#x200B;

**ANOTHER EDIT:**

**Kestra Advisory Services** have only filed 4 13F forms since 2013

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g50qaa5eu5e71.png?width=3748&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a256daf3d05320faf4cbbe75f7a1bcbe5faa1d

There are several mutations of the Kestra name on the SEC site

After looking through them all **Kestra Private Wealth Services** is the only other one with 13F filings.

Again we are looking at some pretty big numbers for these 13F files

&#x200B;

All the Kestra mutations have only filed 7 13F forms in the last 20 years. All of them in 2020 and 2021. All of them in the trillions of $.
