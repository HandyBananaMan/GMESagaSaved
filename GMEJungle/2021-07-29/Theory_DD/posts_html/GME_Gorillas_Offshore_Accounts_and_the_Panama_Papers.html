<p>Saw the SS post with the Bloomberg terminal showing 1.1m puts held by 2 companies in Brazil and started looking into them.</p>

<p>Constancia Investimentos (constantCIA investments? …huh?)</p>

<p>Anyway I looked up the companies and found this on Twitter:</p>
<p>https://mobile.twitter.com/gorilainvest/status/1333874188071923717</p>
<p>Gorilla Investments (<em>of all fucking things</em>) featuring a live event with Bernardo Goldstajn, the Head of Wealth Management &amp;amp; Partner at Constancia Investimentos. The topic? Offshore Assets.</p>
<p>I looked up Bernardo and one of the first links is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>ABOUT THIS DATABASE</strong>
This ICIJ database contains information on more than 785,000 offshore entities that are part of the Panama Papers, the Offshore Leaks, the Bahamas Leaks and the Paradise Papers investigations. The data covers nearly 80 years up to 2016 and links to people and companies in more than 200 countries and territories.</p>

<p>I remembered vaguely hearing about the Panama Papers years ago so did some more reading.</p>
<p>https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry</strong>
<em>A giant leak of more than 11.5 million financial and legal records exposes a system that enables crime, corruption and wrongdoing, hidden by secretive offshore companies.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out at least a couple people died because of what was released in those papers:

<p>Unfortunately I had just smoked a blunt and read this post before looking into the companies, so now I’m paranoid and won’t be digging any deeper. https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otne87/yall_are_trippin_if_you_think_this_is_just_us/</p>
<p><strong>Important disclaimer:</strong>
Just because someone is named in the Panama Papers doesn’t mean they’re a criminal. Emma Watson is in there, she’s probably not a criminal. But who knows, maybe she was the runic magick superstonk plant.</p>
<p>Edit: words and bad info.</p>
