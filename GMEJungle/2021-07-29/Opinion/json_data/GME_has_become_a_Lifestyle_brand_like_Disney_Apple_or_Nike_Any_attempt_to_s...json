    "selftext": "TL;DR: The brand of GME is lightning in a bottle. Hodling has become a defining part of many people's lives. \n\nThis isn't financial advice and I know nothing about finace but I do know how the value of public perception. I'm co-owner of my business, this one I've had for about 5 years, but it is my fourth business and so far, my most successful. All of the businesses I have started from scratch and all have sold directly to the public. Over time it has become very evident that when selling a product or idea to the public, no matter what product, branding is everything. \n\nIn my understanding, there are four levels of branding: \n\n1. Product\n2. Label\n3. Brand\n4. Lifestyle \n\nThe first three levels you can market and spend to attain. The fourth one, the top tier, Lifestyle, cannot be bought or paid for. Something has to resonate with the buying public to make that lightning bolt strike. \n\nHere is the levels of branding in simple terms. You need something to put on your feet so they don't get hurt from walking and running around. \n\nEnter the Product: Shoes. You go to the cheapest store around and buy the cheapest pair that fit your feet. \n\nYou realize shoes are of some importance to you so you decide to spend a bit more on your next pair. This time when looking as shoes, you take note of the details of the shoe, its logo, its color, its particular subtleties. You like the shoe, you are willing to pay more for it, that's a Label. \n\nYou are now a shoe afficianoado and are in the market to spend a bit more on your next pair. You're looking for a Brand. You've seen it advertised, you've seen athletes wear them, you appreciate the extra fit and finish on them and you are proud to show them off. This is where most companies with a ton of money to spend on marketing end up. But then miles ahead of them are Lifestyle brands. These are brands that become a defining characteristic of the people who purchase them. They have fans. They have devotees. \n\nApple. Margaritaville. Disney. Big Green Egg. Ford Trucks. Or in the case of shoes, Nike. These brands define their customers and their customers are fiercely loyal. \n\nAs far as branding goes, this year GME has reached a level of brand recognition that most companies cannot ever achieve, no matter how hard they try or how much they spend. The GME stock has become a \"Lifestyle brand.\" Try convincing a Disney fan that Six Flags has better theme parks or DreamWorks makes better animated movies. Arguing will only strengthen their brand loyalty. That's why the SHF cannot win. The Rubicon has been crossed. The more we're told to sell the more we'll want to buy.",
