<p>He's pinning the focus on how technology affects the market (a point bolstered by his follow-up tweet) as opposed to the abusive/malicious practices that happen behind the veiled curtain. Practices that, for as long as they've been in play, have been allowed to exist unnoticed by the average investor until apes came along. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the plight of GME is getting more exposure, but technology has fuck'all to do with what's happening in the market right now aside from making it easier to fist retail with a spiked glove.</p>
