<h1>Title: I swear not FUD - legitimate stupid question. If people continue to buy, and the MM is routing the trades so that they are the other side of the transaction knowing they have no shares and planning to FTD, does it create an infinite ammo cheat code?</h1>

<p>If they are simply taking in money, not giving up anything and then using the funds against us, obviously the grave digs deeper, but if the plan as MC said, is to never cover then is the Buy-FTD cycle infinite?</p>
<p>I swear not FUD, just trying to figure out if there is anything in place to prevent an infinite loop.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have prefaced with saying, this isnâ€™t a plea for things to happen faster, more so a premise of what propels the can.</p>
