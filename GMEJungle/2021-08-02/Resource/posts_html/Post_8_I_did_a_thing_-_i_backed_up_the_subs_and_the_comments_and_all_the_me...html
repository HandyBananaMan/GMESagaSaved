<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Ape historian here.</p>
<p>I know ive been a way for a loong time, but i am going to make a post about what has been happening.</p>
<p>The first things is that the data ingestion process has now completed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Drumroll please for the data" src="https://i.redd.it/y4zrrxmzxye71.gif" /></p>
<p>We have some nice juicy progress, and nice juicy data. There is still a mountain of work to do and ~~i know this post will get downvoted to shit.~~  EDIT: wow actually the shills didnt manage to kill this one!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Point 1:</strong>  I have all the GME subs and all the submissions. Yeah. ALL. OF THEM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Superstonk</li>
<li>DDintoGME</li>
<li>GME</li>
<li>GMEJungle</li>
<li>AND wallstreetbets</li>
</ul>
<p>Why the wallstreet bets you might ask? because of point 2. The ammount of data that we have: and oh apes do we have  A LOT!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="6 millies for GME, 300k for the GME sub, 9millies for superstonk. and (still processing 44! Million for wallstreet bets!)" src="https://preview.redd.it/eweg6scnzye71.png?width=254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f9f98c5f7b344a925a915253f8150987987b4c" /></p>
<p>so why is the chart above important?</p>
<p><strong>Point 2: Because i also downloaded all the comments for all those subs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Point 3:</strong> The prelinary word classification has been done and the next steps are on the way and we have 1.4Million potential key words and phrases. that have been extracted</p>
<p>Now for anyone who is following, we have \~800k posts, around 60 million comments and each of those have to be classified.</p>
<p>Each post and comment may and does have a subset of those 1.4Million keywords in there that we need to identify.</p>
<p>The only problem is is that with standard approaches, checking millions of rows of text against specific keywords takes a long long time, and i have been working on figuring out how to get the processing time down from \~20-50 milliseconds per row to the microsecond scale - which funnily enough took about 3 days.</p>
<p>We have all seen comparison of million and billion. now here is the differnence in procesessing time if i said 20milliseconds is fast enough.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="processing of one (out of multiple!) steps at 20milliseconds per row" src="https://preview.redd.it/b4rl6mo31ze71.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2107b7970cc1ccec83f2e8650829900b33dc34af" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Same dataset but now at \~20 microseconds per row processing time" src="https://preview.redd.it/8r3gmysb1ze71.png?width=712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=013ed2a270711adde8782b56df8716a2978bfb18" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But we are there now!</p>
<p><strong>Point 5: we have a definitive list of authors:</strong> across both comments and posts, by post type, and soon by comment sentiment and comment type</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="total number of authors across comments and posts across all subs- as you can see we have some lurkers! Note that some of those authors have posted literally hundreds of times, so its important to be aware of that." src="https://preview.redd.it/41wzjweq3ze71.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0bf452750f21a5eacfecdae7bf13984763b03f3" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My next plan of action:</p>
<p>the first few steps in the process have been completed. I now have more than enough data to work with.</p>
<p>I would be keen to hear back from you if you have specific questions.</p>
<p>Here is my though process for the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>run further NLP processes to extract hedge fund names, and discussions about hedgies in general</li>
<li>complete analysis on the classified posts and comments to try to group people together - do a certain number of apes talk about a specific point - can we use this methodology to detect shills if a certain account keeps talking about "selling GME" or something like this.</li>
<li>Run sentiment analysis on the comments to identify if specific users are being overly negative or positive.</li>
<li>And any suggestions that you may have as well!</li>
</ol>
