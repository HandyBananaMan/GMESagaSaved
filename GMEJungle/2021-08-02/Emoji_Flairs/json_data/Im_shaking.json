    "selftext": "I just got off the phone with my mom. I have talked to her about GME since January. Today I mentioned that this guy DFV bought 50,000 MORE shares at about this price when his first 50,000 were worth tens of millions. Her response?  \"I'm hanging up, calling my financial advisor, and telling him to buy $30,000 in Gamestop.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friends... when that order goes through I'm officially calling her my Big Mama, the Whale, Destroyer of Hedge Funds, First of her Name, and All Around Bad-Ass Woman\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: I just wanted to address some things people are worried about in the comments.   \n\n\n1) My mom is financially well off enough that ***this is money she can afford to lose***. It's still a shitty loss if it is a loss (doubt it but okay), but it will in no way shape or form impact her financial standing if she loses it all.   \n2) She **had been considering getting in on GME for a while**. She is a smart woman and is not going to invest that much on a whim because her kid told her about some guy with a headband who ***isn't*** *a cat!* She will take my opinions into **consideration**, but she is her own person and she is in many ways smarter than me (especially with money).  \n3) As far as I am aware the order did ***NOT*** go through today. She missed her advisor on the phone and I have not heard from her since. See y'all bright and early tomorrow!",
