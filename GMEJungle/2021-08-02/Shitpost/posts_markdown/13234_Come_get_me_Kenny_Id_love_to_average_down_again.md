Here's my story..March 2020 I bought 379 shares of Moderna at $25.  Today, it would be worth over $131,000... but I sold most of it to go full hard on into GME. 

Today,  the SHF'S are getting close to my cost basis manipulating the price.

Am I worried?? 

Do I regret selling Moderna ??

No fucking way.. Moderna would have made me a tidy sum, more actually than I've ever made in a year off stocks..  but GME....??  

GME will take me and my whole family to the Moon. 

So c'mon Shitadel, bring it lower..I'll just buy more.


Edit: price doesn't matter, but it makes me feel good when I lower my cost.. lol. 

Thanks for all the support and positive chatter on this post Apes. Together Strong.
