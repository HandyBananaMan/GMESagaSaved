    "selftext": "Here's my story..March 2020 I bought 379 shares of Moderna at $25.  Today, it would be worth over $131,000... but I sold most of it to go full hard on into GME. \n\nToday,  the SHF'S are getting close to my cost basis manipulating the price.\n\nAm I worried?? \n\nDo I regret selling Moderna ??\n\nNo fucking way.. Moderna would have made me a tidy sum, more actually than I've ever made in a year off stocks..  but GME....??  \n\nGME will take me and my whole family to the Moon. \n\nSo c'mon Shitadel, bring it lower..I'll just buy more.\n\n\nEdit: price doesn't matter, but it makes me feel good when I lower my cost.. lol. \n\nThanks for all the support and positive chatter on this post Apes.
