    "selftext": "Strange, considering I thought 20% value loss is what happens when companies are seen as weak investments.\n\n* No debt\n* Warehouses\n* Cash warchest\n* Crypto in the pipeline\n* Dozens of new job openings\n* Execs from Chewy and Amazon\n* Deadwood removed from the board\n* Closing none profit stores\n* Engaging with shoppers online\n* CEO that goes into stores undercover to see what is good and bad\n* Huge retail following\n* Float owned by retail\n* Retail spamming the gamestop online store for purchases\n* Stock price declines when nobody sells\n\nPrice seems legit I guess.",
