Strange, considering I thought 20% value loss is what happens when companies are seen as weak investments.

* No debt
* Warehouses
* Cash warchest
* Crypto in the pipeline
* Dozens of new job openings
* Execs from Chewy and Amazon
* Deadwood removed from the board
* Closing none profit stores
* Engaging with shoppers online
* CEO that goes into stores undercover to see what is good and bad
* Huge retail following
* Float owned by retail
* Retail spamming the gamestop online store for purchases
* Stock price declines when nobody sells

Price seems legit I guess.
