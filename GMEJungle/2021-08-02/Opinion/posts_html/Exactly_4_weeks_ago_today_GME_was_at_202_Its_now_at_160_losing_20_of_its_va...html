<p>Strange, considering I thought 20% value loss is what happens when companies are seen as weak investments.</p>
<ul>
<li>No debt</li>
<li>Warehouses</li>
<li>Cash warchest</li>
<li>Crypto in the pipeline</li>
<li>Dozens of new job openings</li>
<li>Execs from Chewy and Amazon</li>
<li>Deadwood removed from the board</li>
<li>Closing none profit stores</li>
<li>Engaging with shoppers online</li>
<li>CEO that goes into stores undercover to see what is good and bad</li>
<li>Huge retail following</li>
<li>Float owned by retail</li>
<li>Retail spamming the gamestop online store for purchases</li>
<li>Stock price declines when nobody sells</li>
</ul>
<p>Price seems legit I guess.</p>
