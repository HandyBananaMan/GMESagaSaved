<p>This is different from <a href="https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/job/director-of-finance/J3W48S5VYCX07F6G4ZG">Director of Finance</a> which is exactly what you would expect, merchandising and how the company spends its money. <a href="https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/job/director-financial-systems/J3R8HL6HN1KLKTJ4Z2K">Director of Financial Systems</a>: "...Drive visibility on process improvement opportunities that <strong>facilitate the success of a world class accounting and finance organization</strong>." and "Assess and obtain <strong>relevant stakeholder buy in</strong> on the impact of proposed process/systems changes on the internal control and SOX key control environments." Experience in <strong>progressive accounting</strong> required. Their Preferred section reads like an ape honor code btw.</p>
<p>I'm slowly putting together a DD but my tits are jacked because I sure think GameStop's "one and only" NFT is going to be tied to the worth of the company, then fractionalized and paired as a unit to current shares. [After all, their billion dollar positive net balance is basically them holding our money to use on business ventures that will make more money to return to us.] Squeeze happens. New class of millionaires overnight. Apes stake their new money in E T H's [environmentally sustainable] Proof-of-Stake system instead of using centralized banks, not only because of principle but because it will give a nice 8% earnings while the stock market tumbles and inflation eats away at the USD.</p>
<p>Sounds a lot like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock aka the world's largest investment management and who the US Gov tapped to clean up the mess of the GFC, <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">directly telling CEOs that net zero "demands a transformation of the entire economy" and the "fundamental reallocation of capital"</a> [Read the whole letter, it's great.]</p>
<p>Couldn't wait to put this up but more coming soon</p>
<p>Edit: I wanted to highlight the stakeholder buy-in because they are really focused on stakeholders, that's not proof of anything itself</p>
<p>Editt: Wild speculation but maybe this is what DFV was pointing to in his ATM/Bank of America tweet. BoA ATM logo blurred out, GameStop logo above the ATM...</p>
<p>Edittt: hot take, MOASS being delayed because the infrastructure bill (theyâ€™re trying to sneak in a provision to treat miners/stakers as brokers)</p>
