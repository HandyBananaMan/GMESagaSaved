<p>Sometimes it will be rich things, sometimes it will be about changing the system. Either way, I decided pictures are the best with something about them. If you don't like it, totally cool, just wanted to motivate somehow and help contribute to the cause, in case someone needed any more motivation for the day / week, especially given the "YAY LETS DROP THE PRICE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE STUPID AND WILL SELL" day we just had ( stupid HFs, I held onto a fucking Runescape account 15 years old just to sell it to buy GME lmayo XD). Also, no idea how to flair this, so I'm going to flair this as an opinion. If someone has a better suggestion, then say so.</p>
<p>First one's one that people have gotten behind before: the environment. Whatever your position on the environment, it's so very obvious that we abuse our planet. Look at this Pacific Trash Dump: trillions of pieces of plastic that's three times the size of france (3X!!!!) and it's "only" 1 of 5 giant dumps in the seas. Sea turtles will probably consume mostly plastic throughout their lives, because of what we did and do.</p>

<p>You know what would be great? If we could see the ocean like this:</p>
