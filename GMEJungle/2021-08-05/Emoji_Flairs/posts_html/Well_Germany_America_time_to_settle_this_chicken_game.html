<p>If German apes own the float and American apes own the float we(disclaimer yadiyadiyadah) all know that apes from both countries are both due for tendies in the millions if not billions. So the remaining question becomes: which apes representing the two(and more) countries are going to receive the  "paper-handed-bitch" title by folding first? I was never into getting in a dick-measuring contest but I've got to know which country has the better pull-out game so i can find my wife's next boyfriend.</p>
