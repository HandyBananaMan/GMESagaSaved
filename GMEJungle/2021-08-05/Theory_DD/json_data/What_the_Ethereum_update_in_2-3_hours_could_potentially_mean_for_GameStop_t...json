You then have a massive blockchain of all the authentic shares of GME for all to see. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Great, but what does this mean for YOU/the MOASS?**\n\nAs the GME data feed is added to the LINK oracle network. The current update will allow the ethereum network to read data from the stock market which in turn lets GameStop have a valid reason/ability to see data like  who owns the stock, and at what date, time, price, whether it was synthetic etc. because to issue out these NFTs/GMEcoins as a dividend to the correct shareholders this will be needed. Could this also force shorts to close? I'm not too sure tbh. Probably?\n\n\n**^ Let me know if this is correct, if I made any mistakes etc, I'm also okay with the mods marking this as shitpost if I'm wrong**\n**TL;DR Hedgies R fuk**\n\n\nUpdate from twitter gamestop lead nft designer:\nhttps://twitter.com/nftspike/status/1423266286109294596\n\n**Context: EIP-1559 \u2013 improves the transaction fee market**",
