Stop. Fucking. Doing. It.

If you are legit:

1) You are making yourself a target for shills by broadcasting your position.

2) Nobody care about your position. If you are trying to gain traction by showing your GME joystick, you look like an ass, you will look like a shill and nobody should listen to you.

3) You are inadvertably segmenting us into caste.

If you are a shill, you are just trying to spread FUD/make people paperhand and you are a pathetic sack of shyte of a human being if you are doing that.

We all own shares here, no need to show off your position as we are all individuals able to make their own choice on a stock we love.

Buy. Hodl. Love the stock.
