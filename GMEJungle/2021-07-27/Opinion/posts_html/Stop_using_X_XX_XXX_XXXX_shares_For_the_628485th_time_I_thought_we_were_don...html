<p>Stop. Fucking. Doing. It.</p>
<p>If you are legit:</p>
<p>1) You are making yourself a target for shills by broadcasting your position.</p>
<p>2) Nobody care about your position. If you are trying to gain traction by showing your GME joystick, you look like an ass, you will look like a shill and nobody should listen to you.</p>
<p>3) You are inadvertably segmenting us into caste.</p>
<p>If you are a shill, you are just trying to spread FUD/make people paperhand and you are a pathetic sack of shyte of a human being if you are doing that.</p>
<p>We all own shares here, no need to show off your position as we are all individuals able to make their own choice on a stock we love.</p>
<p>Buy. Hodl. Love the stock.</p>
