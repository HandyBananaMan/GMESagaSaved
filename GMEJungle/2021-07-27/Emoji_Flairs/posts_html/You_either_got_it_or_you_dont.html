<p>Edit: As u/WhiteShadoh points out, I accidentally misclicked the "m" for "b". Fixed.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Just reached 420 upvotes and 88 comments at the same time. Looks like where I'm going, we wont need blunts.</p>
<p>There's a lot of horse shit in this pony show going around. I for one am prepared for anything, and will either be a billionaire or go homeless. </p>
<p>There's a lot of posts going around talking about the massive FUD campaign that will surely ensue as the moass gets closer. A "multi-billion dollar effort" to do whatever it takes to get us to sell before we see international phone numbers in our accounts. </p>
<p>You either got what it takes to hodl with your life, or you'll live the rest of your life regretting the missed opportunity of a lifetime. </p>
<p>You don't need anymore DD. You don't need anymore news. You dont need someone to hold your hand. If you aren't absolutely sure that all it takes for you to make billions upon billions of dollars is to just hold one stock. Then sell it or short it and fuck off. If you are sure, then God be with you. No amount of FUD is gonna make me change my mind, and the more they spend on it, the less they have to keep Marge from calling. </p>
<p>God speed to you all. This is not financial advice. I dip crayons in honey mustard before consuming them deep fried. See recipe in comments.</p>
