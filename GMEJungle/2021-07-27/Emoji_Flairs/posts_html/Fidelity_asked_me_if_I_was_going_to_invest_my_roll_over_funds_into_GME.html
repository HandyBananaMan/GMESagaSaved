<p>So I beg and the process of rolling over old retirement accounts from old employers so I could allocate the funds to GME. While I was on the phone with the guy explaining the roll over process he asked; </p>
<p>Fidelity: “Do you know what you’re wanting to do with the funds?”
Me: “Yes”
Fidelity: “Are you putting it into GameStop?”
Me: “yes, how’d you know?”
Fidelity: “ I can see your other account allocations and it’s %100 GameStop.”</p>
<p>Made my night lmao he wouldn’t tell me any thoughts on the stocks or situation but I did try 🦍🦧</p>
