<p>I'm a January ape like many of you. Part of this whole saga has been watching the ebb and flow of public interest in this bet of ours. After a while you get a pretty good sense of what is the "baseline"  amount of activity for social media around GME.</p>
<p>This... Is different. There is something unfocused about people's behavior right now. It's like everyone is doing some kind of internal preflight checklist before liftoff.</p>
<p>I think also the shills are panicking. Nothing is working so they are shotgunning FUD, but it's almost as if they are screaming in an empty room.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to make of it, but the overall tone has suddenly shifted. It's like a kid fidgeting in the waiting room at the doctors office.</p>
<p>Just a thought I had.</p>
<p>Edit: dammit I messed up the title. Whatever you know what I mean.</p>
