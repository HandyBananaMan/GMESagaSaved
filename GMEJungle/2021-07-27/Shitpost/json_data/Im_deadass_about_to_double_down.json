    "selftext": "So my girlfriend (who knows less about stocks or how the market works than our smoothest of brained) told me my investment into gme isn't gonna make me any money because \"in order to make money in the stock market, I feel like you need to at least start with like 10 thousand to even make anything\" \n I told her all I'm hearing is to put more money in and therefore have come to the sound financial decision to double down on my investments this week. Let's. Fucking. Go.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit:  Holy fuck this post blew up, thank you for the awards and the comments have me and my girl laughing hard. To clarify I'm a xx holder and by double down I mean I'm doubling the amount of shares I currently have. My portfolio became my savings account 5 months ago but I just got a nice bonus check that I got the greenlight to put into gme. Also to clarify, deadass is lingo from my area that I forget isn't just a normal everyday saying lmayo",
