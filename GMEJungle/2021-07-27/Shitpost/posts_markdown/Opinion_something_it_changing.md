I'm a January ape like many of you. Part of this whole saga has been watching the ebb and flow of public interest in this bet of ours. After a while you get a pretty good sense of what is the "baseline"  amount of activity for social media around GME.

This... Is different. There is something unfocused about people's behavior right now. It's like everyone is doing some kind of internal preflight checklist before liftoff.

I think also the shills are panicking. Nothing is working so they are shotgunning FUD, but it's almost as if they are screaming in an empty room.

I'm not sure what to make of it, but the overall tone has suddenly shifted. It's like a kid fidgeting in the waiting room at the doctors office.

Just a thought I had.

Edit: dammit I messed up the title. Whatever you know what I mean.
