    "selftext": "All I\u2019m seeing is karma whoring posts of people that think they have a good idea and post it to try to get support. These ideas are 99.9% terrible. \n\nIf you think you have a good idea, before you post it I want you to do 3 things. \n\n1. Put your phone down. \n2. Get a drink of water, not a garbage energy drink, just plain old water. \n3. Think about it, is this something that RC would actually say?\n\nRC has 12 stages of depth in all of his communications that takes hours to unravel. You can\u2019t say anything to him that he doesn\u2019t already know. \n\nHe can\u2019t outright attack other people. He can\u2019t mock other people. Trying to get them to do negative things puts a negative focus on GS. \n\nGameStop and RC are positive, good, happy entities. Let\u2019s keep it that way. \n\nThat was a lot longer than anticipated. Oops.\n\n\nQuick edit: I don\u2019t need karma, nor do I give a shit about it. Please feel free to downvote this post.",
