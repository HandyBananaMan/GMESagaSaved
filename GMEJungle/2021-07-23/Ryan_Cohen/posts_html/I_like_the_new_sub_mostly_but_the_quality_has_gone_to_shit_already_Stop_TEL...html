<h1>Title: I like the new sub, mostly, but the quality has gone to shit already. Stop TELLING RC / GS what to do. They are far smarter than you and know what they are doing.</h1>

<p>All I’m seeing is karma whoring posts of people that think they have a good idea and post it to try to get support. These ideas are 99.9% terrible. </p>
<p>If you think you have a good idea, before you post it I want you to do 3 things. </p>
<ol>
<li>Put your phone down. </li>
<li>Get a drink of water, not a garbage energy drink, just plain old water. </li>
<li>Think about it, is this something that RC would actually say?</li>
</ol>
<p>RC has 12 stages of depth in all of his communications that takes hours to unravel. You can’t say anything to him that he doesn’t already know. </p>
<p>He can’t outright attack other people. He can’t mock other people. Trying to get them to do negative things puts a negative focus on GS. </p>
<p>GameStop and RC are positive, good, happy entities. Let’s keep it that way. </p>
<p>That was a lot longer than anticipated. Oops.</p>
<p>Quick edit: I don’t need karma, nor do I give a shit about it. Please feel free to downvote this post.</p>
