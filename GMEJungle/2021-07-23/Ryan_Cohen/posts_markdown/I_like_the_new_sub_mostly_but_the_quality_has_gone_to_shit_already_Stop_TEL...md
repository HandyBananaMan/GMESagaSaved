# Title: I like the new sub, mostly, but the quality has gone to shit already. Stop TELLING RC / GS what to do. They are far smarter than you and know what they are doing.

All I’m seeing is karma whoring posts of people that think they have a good idea and post it to try to get support. These ideas are 99.9% terrible. 

If you think you have a good idea, before you post it I want you to do 3 things. 

1. Put your phone down. 
2. Get a drink of water, not a garbage energy drink, just plain old water. 
3. Think about it, is this something that RC would actually say?

RC has 12 stages of depth in all of his communications that takes hours to unravel. You can’t say anything to him that he doesn’t already know. 

He can’t outright attack other people. He can’t mock other people. Trying to get them to do negative things puts a negative focus on GS. 

GameStop and RC are positive, good, happy entities. Let’s keep it that way. 

That was a lot longer than anticipated. Oops.


Quick edit: I don’t need karma, nor do I give a shit about it. Please feel free to downvote this post.
