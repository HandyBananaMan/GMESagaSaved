# Title: This site is shadowbaning the content, and specially the DD, from every major sub related to GME

First time I noticed this was in \[r\]SuperStonk, [almost a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8y11s/the_dd_section_has_disappeared_from_the_filters/)... I was downvoted to oblivion, and ignored by the mods, despite the importance of this fact.

Now it is also happening in \[r\]GME, \[r\]DDintoGME... and **here.**

New posts with the flair can be seen in the feeds, of course, but to filter by those flairs (and therefore to find or dive for such content) seems impossible.

Some time ago, it still worked in old.reddit, but now (at least for me) is not working even there.

Am I the only one suffering from this situation?

Isn't this a direct way to hide and make the most important content unreachable?

[Also, every post with this topic is quickly downvoted, and now with no discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/oq1ex8/is_this_site_shadowbaning_the_content_and/)
