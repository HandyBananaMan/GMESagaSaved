<h1>Title: This site is shadowbaning the content, and specially the DD, from every major sub related to GME</h1>

<p>First time I noticed this was in [r]SuperStonk, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8y11s/the_dd_section_has_disappeared_from_the_filters/">almost a month ago</a>... I was downvoted to oblivion, and ignored by the mods, despite the importance of this fact.</p>
<p>Now it is also happening in [r]GME, [r]DDintoGME... and <strong>here.</strong></p>
<p>New posts with the flair can be seen in the feeds, of course, but to filter by those flairs (and therefore to find or dive for such content) seems impossible.</p>
<p>Some time ago, it still worked in old.reddit, but now (at least for me) is not working even there.</p>
<p>Am I the only one suffering from this situation?</p>
<p>Isn't this a direct way to hide and make the most important content unreachable?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/oq1ex8/is_this_site_shadowbaning_the_content_and/">Also, every post with this topic is quickly downvoted, and now with no discussion.</a></p>
