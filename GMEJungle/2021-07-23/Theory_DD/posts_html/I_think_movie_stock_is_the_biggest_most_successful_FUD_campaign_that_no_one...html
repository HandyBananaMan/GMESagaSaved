<p>I am still 100% convinced that movie stock is the biggest most successful FUD of this entire saga.</p>
<p>Never had the backing of major big brained apes, doesn't have RC, DFV said it isn't the same, short % isn't even close... and yet every time it comes up, people always say "Nooooo! Let them have fun too!!! Apes all together strong! Don't be mean!" and it's upvoted a ton.</p>
<p>MSM? They started talking about the squeeze potential and movie co is always on the main stage in front of GME. Youtubers are all focused on movies instead of games... It's bizarre how, at the very least, the big YouTubers are all about both but MAINLY talk about movie stock.</p>
<p>How about it's movement diverging from GME to look similar but like it's having larger gains?</p>

<p>Seems odd, no?</p>
<p>And remember, in May when movie stock gains overtook GME gains, the volume was such that there was almost no way it was just retail... something like 600 million shares traded daily during the may jump?</p>
<p>I do think movie stock will squeeze, but i think it's to get people to FOMO into it and not give them a chance to sell and transfer to GME in time... or, a much worst case, is that Delta fucks up in person viewing again, and it goes back on the potential chopping block.</p>
<p>What has the movie co ACTUALLY done to protect or advance their business like GME has?</p>
<p>One of the biggest ways to destroy dissent is through dividing the community and making them fight... isn't it interesting that the only infighting we've seen has been subreddit drama and not the creation of a FUD ape community to drive a real wedge in? Doesn't that seem obvious to find the next biggest meme stock and use it as a trap to prevent even more FOMO to the real goal and potentially use it to drive a wedge between retail?</p>
<p>tldr - Movie stock is the biggest most successful FUD campaign that no one is talking about because it pits retail against retail. We CAN'T talk about it without it causing a bigger rift between retail, and not talking about it is leading to a ton of movie stock FOMO.</p>
<p>Not financial advice. Hell, I can barely read, don't listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've been pointed to a god tier DD talking about this that didn't really get a lot of traction in the SimilarSubreddit... Seriously, my smooth brained take here got more upvotes, which surprises me for a ton of reasons. Go give it a read.</p>
