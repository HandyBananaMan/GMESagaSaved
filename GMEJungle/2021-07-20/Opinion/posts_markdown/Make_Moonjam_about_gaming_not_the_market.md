Didn't see a post about it here, so I figured I'd make one.

Moonjam is about gaming, so go enjoy yourself and play some games, don't bore kids with stock market jargon and don't let bad actors do it either. We like the stock, but at Moonjam, like the block too.

EDIT:

The purpose of this post isn't to stifle hype or information; it's to (hopefully) prevent SPAM and make the event as enjoyable as possible for the gamers in attendance, because GameStop and Astro are throwing an awesome event that should be remembered for how fun it is!

I mean, you *could* just apply an ape skin or a skin with a headband, or a skin with the GameStop logo, and *not* SPAM about the stock, and that'd still do a great job of showing your support and spreading hype. "Nice skin!" or "I like your headband!" sounds better than "omg buy the stock" at a Minecraft event.

I don't think a skin goes against the message of this post because it's still not filling the chat with stock conversation; it's just a visual indicator, you feel me?
