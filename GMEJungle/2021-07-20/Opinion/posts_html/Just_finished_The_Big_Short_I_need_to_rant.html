<p>This entire time people have listed <em>The Big Short</em> as a must watch. I blew it off since its release. This morning, I needed some noise in the background while I work and thought - why not?</p>
<p>I stopped everything. I watched, slightly confused, trying to keep up with the minimal understanding I have of the concepts covered. By the middle I was disgusted. By the end, I cried. Not exactly because of the movie itself. I cried at the realisation that not only is this entire market fraudulent, but my reality itself. </p>
<p>I’ve spent my entire life doubting myself. <em>Maybe I am dumb? Maybe I really don’t understand anything, and it’s best left to more intelligent people. Maybe I’m not worth this job. Maybe I am only worth minimum wage.</em> And it's because of greed. Everything is a lie built to make the rich richer. So much of this goddamned world has been influenced by greed, and it is upsetting to the point of tears. </p>
<p>And it’s because that’s what we’ve been taught. We’re dumb and don’t understand. We’re not worth anything, so we should accept our paltry allowance for the gift that it is. </p>
<p>Witnessing my family struggle. Witnessing everyone struggle. And knowing now that they <strong>knew</strong>. And they let it happen. And worse, that they felt not a single ounce of empathy is truly truly sickening. For me, this isn’t even about making decent gains any more. At this point, I don’t care if my positions go to zero. I want to make ‘them’ suffer. I want them to feel even a FRACTION of the pain that billions of people have endured to finance their games. This whole system is fucked, and honestly, I just want to watch it burn.</p>
<p>We may be a million apes with typewriters, but we’re NOT dumb. In community and communication we have power. And we’re beginning to learn that fact.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, but I needed to get it out and I didn't know who else to turn to.</p>
