So we're all wondering when the MOASS will happen.  We're prepared to wait, but wild speculation is more fun.  I think it's getting pretty damn close.

Assuming this will take months to unravel, I think it has to happen in August.  4th quarter is extremely important to our GDP, especially retail sales, due to Black Friday and the Christmas shopping season.  If the MOASS happens anywhere around October, November or December with a coinciding market crash it will take down not only the equity markets, and everyone's retirement, but will also tank the 4th quarter numbers and our 2021 GDP with it.  Little Timmy getting a can of spam for Christmas because a few hedge funds decided to play God will not play well on national TV.  That's how revolutions happen.

So, given the above I think it happens either early enough to not completely hose 4th quarter or it happens after Christmas.  I don't think the latter is an option for a number of reasons.  First, that puts a lot of investors (January apes) in range of long-term capital gains right off the bat and more and more as the new year drags on.  Secondly, it presumes that they KNOW they can keep it contained for all of October, November and December.  There are too many potential catalysts (known and unknown) for this to be their plan.  Potential catalysts being S&P inclusion, a split, a dividend, a September market correction, continued inflation...and tons of other things that don't come to mind off of the top of my head.  You get the idea.

So, that's my guess.  This happens early enough to not completely destroy our 4th quarter GDP numbers, because letting it happen during Q4 is revolution territory and waiting until 2022 not only significantly reduces potential recapture via taxes but is insanely risky for the reasons listed above.

Bon Apetit, friends.
