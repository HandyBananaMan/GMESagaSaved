<p>At first I thought it was weird because it didn't really seem that important. I was also a little bugged because again it feels like someone is trying to tie us to conspiracy stuff.</p>
<p>After seeing the 20th post about it I decided to write this. These sorts of posts really seems like forum sliding especially the copy + paste identical nature of all of them.</p>
<p>I get it when I see 20 Ryan Cohen tweet posts in a row, because it's actually exciting, but this stuff? Kinda distracts from the important information.</p>
<p>Lastly I'd like to say that it really seems convenient that these all happened today when people started looking into Point72 and Steven Cohen again. </p>
<p>Forum sliding definition:</p>
<p>Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING'</p>
<p>If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</p>
