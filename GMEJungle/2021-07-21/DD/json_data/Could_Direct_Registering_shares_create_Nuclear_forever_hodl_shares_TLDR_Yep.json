Right now, even s s is being deleted so...\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, and here in the jungle there is no education flair so I labled it as DD but I think education would be a more appropriate label)\n\nOld Lady Ape here, (may the reddit gods not take down this post)\n\nIf you have read any of my other posts, you know that I have been working on ways to direct register my shares in order to remove my \u267eforever hodl shares (shares I won't sell during the MOAzz) from the DTC. (Reddit doesn't like it when I add too many links in my post and this sub has banned the term so you will have to search for the original post from [u/BluPrince](https://www.reddit.com/u/BluPrince/)\u267e for yourself). Dr. T had mentioned removing shares in her interview with Atobitt and has reiterated lately that FTDs are the problem. ~~So I am taking a break from finalizing directions on removing shares (because I am getting the MOARA, mother of all run arounds) to talk about~~ (I have finalized directions, see link below) What might happen if people **independently decided** to remove their shares (that they don't want to sell in the MOAzz) from circulation.\n\nTo do this I went to look directly at a rule that is referenced by Queen Kong from the SEC. (DTC 2003-02, link below) From first glance it reminds me that the SEC doesn't ever make new rules, they just clarify them, but it is clear that this is in fact a new rule (in 2003) because there is mention of them accomodating companies in the past.\n\nThis 2003 rule is e$$entially **forbidding company transfer agents (i$$uer of shares) from withdrawing their shares from the DTC. The DTC will only recall shares to the i$$uer if the owner of the shares request them from the DTC.** So this is why it has been so difficult to transfer shares out, because the SEC tied the hands of the i$$uer from helping with this proce$$, other than providing information, in any tangible way. But what I really was interested in was the comments. Remember when all the apes commented on that oo5 rule, and they supplied the comments for us to read? Well they added the coments on this rule too and there is gold in them thar hills!\n\n[Looks like the winners lose on this one](https://preview.redd.it/k9tw915s3lc71.jpg?width=558&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d20be2e55d43f00092a31288548aa2e3221715f2)\n\nApparently the SEC doesn't care how many people don't like the rule. The SEC is gonna SEC. Then they start to summarize reasons these commenters wanted companies to be able to remove their shares from the DTC.\n\n[naked shorts hmm?](https://preview.redd.it/vzbnhmav3lc71.jpg?width=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24ec2ac93cdeb086dfa8b5d517e6bbc0f747bf69)\n\nI read all of these for you, I know, I love you too. Let's look at some of them:\n\n[This is from 2003...](https://preview.redd.it/eapk1vux3lc71.jpg?width=572&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3dee91206ba5407359748942f6917c6d151ce8f)\n\nSounds familiar. And this\n\n[withdrawing shares from the DTC](https://preview.redd.it/ytrz3d014lc71.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=b825cf765161f34a3a489fea0e6aa0c04d76c00e)\n\nThis original ape is saying that withdrawing shares from the DTC protects investors from illegal short selling. and this one too, who also gives us a handy list of things that can happen to make shorts cover. Check out the last one.\n\n[Leonard \\(Silverback\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cv3t4lr34lc71.jpg?width=587&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85fe76fbb48e33a7fb1fbb5101afa564a86acdef)\n\n\"None would consent to have their shares in DTC\" Hmmm exiting shares from the DTC forces shorts to cover....But what about FTDs?\n\n[Blue Industries](https://preview.redd.it/b68u6cb64lc71.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2d9e8ba379f37c3531174b697ad300e55c86922)\n\nSounds like Blue industry is referencing FTD's and acknowledging that allowing companies to remove their shares from DTC would force delivery. I got to show you a few more, this one, where the ape never says he is for or against the rule but yet the SEC knows exactly which side he is on, probably from this spicy paragraph:\n\n[Jake \\(not from Statefarm\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ptmdh2p84lc71.jpg?width=392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08dc812c926b6a5b8e87b163fbbde0c62049c40c)\n\nThere were so many more but I don't want to tempt the Reddit gods with too many pictures.\n\nI also wanted to look at reasons against allowing removal of shares from the DTC to see if there were any valid reasons to not remove shares from the DTC.\n\n**Reasons against**: Would compromise speed and po$$ibly security of the system with regards to paper certificates in particular. Most of the against comments were regarding paper certificates, which is fair but now we are able to DR in digital form so I consider the arguments against no longer valid. Not to mention the fact that almost every comment against was from this list:\n\n* Merril Lynch\n* RBC Dain Rauscher (a broker-dealer)\n* Ameritrade\n* Citibank\n* Edward Jones\n* Charles Schwab\n* Sterne, Agee & Leach (broker-dealer)\n* Mizuho Trust & Banking Co (USA)\n* Prudential Securities Incorporated\n* BNY Clearing Corp.\n* First Clearing Corporation (FCC), subsidiary of Wachovia Corporation\n* Bank of America\n* Fidelity Investments\n* Salomon Smith Barney (clearance and settlement)\n* A.G. EDWARDS & SONS, INC.\n* National Steering Committee of the Bank Depository User Group\n* union planters trust and investment group\n* National Investor Services Corp\n* And this guy a wall street manipulater from way back!\n\n[Kenny G, is this you?...edit: it is not him, this was a joke](https://preview.redd.it/v0c07rtb4lc71.jpg?width=398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f7320b84d551ab7cc5c3b8ae0bed7425f505fa)\n\nI wonder what all of these companies (and that dude?) have in common? I'm gue$$ing that they are the ones benefiting from being able to play fast and loose with delivery of actual stock. So could direct registration of infinity pool shares turn into a nuke for shorts? Looks like a yes to me.\n\n**TLDR: Naked shorts have been a problem for a long time. Until this rule pa$$ed in 2003, companies would remove their shares from the DTC to force naked shorts and FTDs into the open. Now individual investors have to personally request shares to be removed from the DTC to keep them from Rickrolling them.**\n\nI ~~will be doing~~ did this with my \u267eforever hodl shares. ~~I am currently working on writing up the different ways one might do this, as the broker's have made it very hard to do. Please see the links posted in my comment below if you would like to see my preliminary instructions for direct registration.~~ I have a post detailing how you would transfer shares from your broker to be direct registered.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oix5zk/step\\_by\\_step\\_method\\_for\\_direct\\_registering\\_shares/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oix5zk/step_by_step_method_for_direct_registering_shares/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nReading all of those comments (not your's apes) made me seriously mad. This has been going on for far too long. But Kenny and the banks have me$$ed with the wrong ape! I'm ready to make my \u267eforever hodl shares nuclear!\n\nThis is not financial advice. Reddit is too hard for me to figure out, why would you listen to me about anything!\n\nApe no fight Ape, please be kind\n\nEdit;. There are Cons to registering shares. I go over them in a post linked below but...\n\nIt is difficult to sell direct registered shares, and would require at least several busine$$ days to transfer them back to a broker, have them settle and then sell. This would not be a good idea for shares you would like to sell in the MOA$$, only shares you want to keep invested in GME long term. This is not financial advice, oh those crayons aren't sitting well in my stomache\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o76au8/direct\\_registering\\_shares\\_what\\_it\\_is/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o76au8/direct_registering_shares_what_it_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nAlso, in my previous posts I list pros and cons of buying from GME verses transferring shares in. Please know the price is not guaranteed if you purchase new from them. May not be a big deal but GMEs price can be volatile.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o5f8zy/preliminary\\_information\\_for\\_direct\\_registering/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o5f8zy/preliminary_information_for_direct_registering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEdit: forgot this post to help if you want to register\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oix5zk/step\\_by\\_step\\_method\\_for\\_direct\\_registering\\_shares/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oix5zk/step_by_step_method_for_direct_registering_shares/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n**I have no idea what will happen if a large amount of GME shares are registered.** I have only presented a possibility based on historical evidence. Anything else discussed as an outcome of this is purely speculation and in no way represents a goal or guarantee of/from myself. I specifically used the word \"could\" in my post to signify this.\n\n**I am in no way encouraging anyone to do anything with their money or shares.** I am only providing public information for which an individual can use in their own research to make their own decisions about their own shares.\n\n**Please do not comment number of shares that you might want to register. It is not helpful**",
