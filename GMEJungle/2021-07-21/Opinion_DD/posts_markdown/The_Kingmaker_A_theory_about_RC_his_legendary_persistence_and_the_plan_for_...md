So I've spent some time today reading about RC's history with Chewy and his plans in the GME prospectus etc, trying to figure out what the hell his plans might be, and I think I might've finally come up with a decent explanation for why we're still waiting.

**What if the MOASS has become inevitable no matter what we do?**  
If he has the true share count or other undeniable proof from the voting or from the SEC investigation, he would know it's coming - and be uniquely positioned to plan exactly when and how to push the button. 

RC is known for his patience and persistence, he describes himself as ["relentless" and "OCD"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2017/01/10/the-man-who-found-gold-in-dog-food/?sh=233f19933095) and loves to make people happy so much that he stays up to ridiculous hours enjoying positive reviews of Chewy. The more I read about this guy the more I become a huge fan and believer - and absolutely do not think that he would ever lead on a loyal base of shareholders by hinting at a goal that wasn't coming. In fact, he said so in [this SEC filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18231/html) where he claims to be *"willing to become more involved with the Company (GME) under certain circumstances that the Reporting Persons (RC Ventures) believe are likely to produce the* ***best results for all shareholders.***"

"**Best**" is a very specific word coming from someone who pays close attention to details and has "OCD" isn't it? "Best" obviously includes not only the MOASS, but *he wants the MOASS to be as truly spectacular as he can possibly make it.* Whoa, dude.

Not only that, but several "loaded guns" were included in the GME prospectus on the now-infamous [page 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/onthry/new_rc_tweet_not_pg13pg_13_as_in_page_13_of_the/) ("PG13") that I don't need to get into here since others did a much better job explaining them - but basically there's a whole lineup of potential Big Red Shorts-R-Fuk Buttons he could start pushing at any moment.

Instead, **I hypothesize that the wait is a test of character.**  

He is fully aware of his following and our cause, given his past habits of reading reviews online. He might even be reading this! *(Hi, Ryan! You're doing great, I wish I could afford more shares! For once in this godforsaken decade I actually have a future to hope for again! Sorry to give away so much. Let me know if I should take this post down, k?)*
 
If he is certain that MOASS is inevitable, **he is likely aware that it's going to be a "kingmaker" event.** That the shareholders are going to become millionaires as soon as he starts pressing those Big Red Shorts-R-Fuk Buttons. That it might even cause a reckoning that will shake up the entire financial landscape of America. (GMErica!)

And if he knows this... **he is uniquely positioned to affect the process of how these new millionaires are chosen.** 

Why wouldn't he want it to be people that are a little bit like him, or at least seek to become so?   

- **The Cohen Millionaires** should be...  

- **Patient**: Let's make them wait. They should experience failure and never give up. Weather the dips and have the confidence to fold their arms at the peaks and say "I can do better, $350 ain't shit." 

- **Thoughtful**: Enough to figure out what's going on, stare propaganda in the face, read through the lines and have the critical thinking to endure the ridiculous shitstorm of mixed messages we've endured these past few months.

- **Kind**: Ape no fight ape. Ape resist shills and infighting. Ape defend fellow ape by not selling early... and the more apes who stand up for one another and invite one another, the bigger the reward for everyone. Already I see apes making plans to fix this mess of a world, plans that wouldn't have been thought about in advance if we had MOASS in March.

- **Funny**: Obviously anyone who takes themselves totally seriously wouldn't be here at this point. We've pretty much run 'em all off by now, this is a memelord movement through and through. And who isn't tired of stiff suits who would roll their eyes and put on judgmental airs at the first sign of a South Park fart joke or a set of chopsticks up the nose? Anybody who doesn't have a sense of humor is going to be put way off.

In RC I see a guy who meticulously thinks and overthinks every move and has the sheer fortitude to keep throwing himself into a problem until it's solved. **If he knew he was going to be responsible for giving the reins of power to a new class of people, why *wouldn't* he want to make sure they're *decent* people** who will spread delight and joy rather than just a new class of rich bastards stomping on the little guy? I keep seeing "Ready Player One" comparisons flying around, and something like this would be a real Halliday move.

Because he might start pressing those Big Red Buttons.  
Any of them... or *all of them.*  At once or in sequence. Share splits. NFT/crypto dividends. Strategic options deployment to shareholders.  Probably other things I'm not wrinkly brained enough to figure out, but all of the above possibilities are present in [the prospectus](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-186796/). **WOMBO COMBO!** 

So **be a decent person.** Be patient, thoughtful, kind, and funny.  
Make this glorious motherfucker called Ryan Cohen proud when we change the world.  

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.  

**TL;DR**: Hedgies are bloodsucking assholes. RC wants to make sure you're not an asshole before you get your tendies. **Hedgies R Fuk.**
