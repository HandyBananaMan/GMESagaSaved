<p>Edit: to all the late comers, yes I know they readjusted the automod and it is no longer blocking MOASS or other words with the letters “ss.”</p>
<p>Still can’t say crypto, Bitcoin, infinity pool, grapevine (this surprised me), WSB (or its full name) and you still can’t link to other subs at all. Turns out a lot of SS users didn’t even know that r/ddintoGME exists.</p>
<p>I know I’m forgetting a lot of banned words over there but yes, MOASS is allowed again.</p>
