<p>To rent a minecraft server for a big online party and put a diamond on the moon in that server, is the most bullish shit I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>Not to mention the blatant Moass Effect tweet, nft.gamestop.com, and all the other awesome stuff GameStop is coming up with.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the movie stock has none of this news. And even if GME was any other company, say, BlockBuster, do you think they would do anything remotely similar to this?</p>
<p>“Gamers rise up” is honestly a term that holds much more power than what we credit it for. It’s more than a meme. We gamers are one of the most united groups of people on earth and it’s time to use this power to quite literally defeat evil.</p>
