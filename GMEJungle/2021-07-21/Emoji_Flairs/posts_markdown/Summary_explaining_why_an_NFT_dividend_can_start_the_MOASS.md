I'm seeing some apes saying, "NFTs are good, but why are they good?" So here's a summary of how dividends work and why Ryan is a genius:

The DTCC is in charge of giving out dividends for all of the companies whose shares are managed by the DTCC. So GameStop will give the DTCC a number of NFTs that is equal to the number of real shares, and the DTCC is supposed to distribute them to the shareholders.

Normally companies give dividends as cash. So when a company with counterfeit shares gets a dividend, the DTCC gives out the company's dividend, and then they dip into ~~their own funds~~ the shorts' funds to pay the counterfeit share owners.

Overstock knew they were shorted and tried to get around this by giving something as a dividend that they thought had no equivalent value. So Overstock started to rocket as shareholders found this out, but then the DTCC found a loophole let let them pay counterfiets with cash, which made everyone confused, killed the squeeze momentum, and it died out.

GameStop found a dividend that truly has no equivalent, thanks to both the "serial code" aspect of NFTs and the wording of their recent statements. So if they give an NFT dividend equal to the number of real shares, it becomes literally impossible for the DTCC to distribute it to both the real and counterfeit share owners because there are more of them than there are NFTs, and there is no equivalent that they can distribute in its place. So instead, here's what will happen:

1. GameStop gives NFTs equal to the number of real shares to the DTCC.

1. DTCC says, "We can't/won't distribute these."

1. GameStop says, "We have no faith in your ability to manage our shares, so within a maximum of 90 days from now, we will pull out all our shares."

1. GameStop requests their shares from the DTCC.

1. DTCC is now forced to determine which shares are real and which are counterfeit. Real and counterfeit shares are identical, so the only way to differentiate is to force shorts to close.

1. MOASS

*edit*: grammar

*edit 2*: The DTCC won't foot the bill... initially. The first step is that the DTCC forces the shorts to cover. The shorts will cover until they go bankrupt, then the bill gets passed to the DTCC. That step is what makes this a MOASS, and why it's a once in history event. On the rare occasions that squeezes have happened in the past, the shorts could always cover before they went bankrupt, so no one else had to cover their shorts for them. Now, the DTCC knows they'll have to cover and maybe (probably) go bankrupt themselves, which is why they've been delaying this instead of enforcing their own rules.

*edit 3*: You will probably not get a dividend, and that's the whole point of making it an NFT. The NFT cannot possibly be distributed until the total number of shares in existence equals the number of real shares. That only happens when the shorts have covered, which means the NFT can only be distributed post-MOASS to all the people who missed the MOASS.
