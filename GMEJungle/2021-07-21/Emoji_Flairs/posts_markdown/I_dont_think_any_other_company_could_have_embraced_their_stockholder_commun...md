To rent a minecraft server for a big online party and put a diamond on the moon in that server, is the most bullish shit I’ve ever seen.


Not to mention the blatant Moass Effect tweet, nft.gamestop.com, and all the other awesome stuff GameStop is coming up with.

Meanwhile, the movie stock has none of this news. And even if GME was any other company, say, BlockBuster, do you think they would do anything remotely similar to this?

“Gamers rise up” is honestly a term that holds much more power than what we credit it for. It’s more than a meme. We gamers are one of the most united groups of people on earth and it’s time to use this power to quite literally defeat evil.
