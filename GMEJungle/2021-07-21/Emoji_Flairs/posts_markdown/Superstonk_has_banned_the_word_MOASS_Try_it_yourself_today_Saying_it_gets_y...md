Edit: to all the late comers, yes I know they readjusted the automod and it is no longer blocking MOASS or other words with the letters “ss.”

Still can’t say crypto, Bitcoin, infinity pool, grapevine (this surprised me), WSB (or its full name) and you still can’t link to other subs at all. Turns out a lot of SS users didn’t even know that r/ddintoGME exists.

I know I’m forgetting a lot of banned words over there but yes, MOASS is allowed again.
