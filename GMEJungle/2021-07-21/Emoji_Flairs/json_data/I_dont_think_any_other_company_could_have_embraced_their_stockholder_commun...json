And even if GME was any other company, say, BlockBuster, do you think they would do anything remotely similar to this?\n\n\u201cGamers rise up\u201d is honestly a term that holds much more power than what we credit it for. It\u2019s more than a meme. We gamers are one of the most united groups of people on earth and it\u2019s time to use this power to quite literally defeat evil.",
