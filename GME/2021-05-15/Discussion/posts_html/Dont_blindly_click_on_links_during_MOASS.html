<p>Reddit allows us to change the original link to text. This can be misused by the shills during the MOASS.</p>
<p>eg, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvYLovp5isw">https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1392649234944507906</a></p>
<p>This is the link to Ryan Cohen's latest tweet, OR IS IT? Try for yourself.</p>
<p>The shills could change the original links just like this and lead you to phishing sites.</p>
<p>But this can be avoided if you check the url before clicking the link. To check the link address, you can simply copy the link and paste it in your address bar to see if it is the same link you clicked on.</p>

<p>Edit: Like an ape pointed out: <strong>Another way to check the link is to scroll over it with your mouse, but not click the link. The real link will show up in the bottom left corner of your browser when you hover over it.</strong></p>
<p>Edit 2: You can go to <img alt="https://urlscan.io/" src="https://urlscan.io/" /> to check if the url is safe. </p>
<p>Stay safe apes, see you on the moon ðŸš€ ðŸš€</p>
