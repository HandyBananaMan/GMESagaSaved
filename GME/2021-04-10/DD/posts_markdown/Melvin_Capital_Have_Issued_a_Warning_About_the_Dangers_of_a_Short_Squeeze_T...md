Okay, so I got pulled down a rabbit hole because the news says that Melvin Capital has a year to date loss of 49% but SEC filings shows they had over $20 billion in assets at the end of 2020 while the MSM reported that they only had $12.5 billion at the beginning of the year.

See:

and

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/hedge-fund-melvin-capital-posts-first-quarter-decline-of-49

My ponderings about how MSM could get the value of AUM so staggeringly wrong led me to this website:

https://docoh.com/company/1628110/melvin-capital-management-lp

It shows that Melvin currently has Assets Under Management of $13.1B, and Regulatory Assets Under Management of $24.52B. 

These are the figures as of the 8th of March 2021. I'll come back to them later. 

Interestingly, they link to The Brochure, titled Part 2A of Form ADV, filed 8th March 2021. Check out section 8, page 12:

"Short  Sales.  Short  sales  can,  in  certain  circumstances,  substantially  increase  the  impact  of adverse price movements on client’s portfolios. A short sale involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited  increase  in  the  market  price  of  the  particular  investment  sold  short,  which  could result in an inability to cover the short position and a theoretically unlimited loss. There can be no assurance that securities necessary to cover short positions will be available for purchase. Additionally, purchasing securities to close out the short position can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further if the demand to buy such securities outpaces the available supply, thereby exacerbating the loss.

For  instance,  a  so-called “short squeeze” can occur when the price of securities in which a Fund has an open short position rises sharply in a short time frame. The rapid rise may be a result of (i) multiple short sellers seeking to cover their short positions in the same time frame by  purchasing  the  security,  resulting  in  a  rapid  price  increase;  (ii)  market  participants collectively purchasing a significant number of shares, thereby causing a substantial increase in the price of such securities; and/or (iii) one or more lenders of a security that was used to facilitate a short position suddenly demanding the return of the security that has been loaned. A “short squeeze” may result in a Fund or ManagedAccount having to prematurely close out a short position at unattractively high prices, resulting in a substantial loss. Further, the risk of a “short squeeze” likely will increase if other short sellers, market participants, and/or lenders become  aware  of  our  short  positions,  including,  without  limitation,  as  a  result  of  legally-required reporting with respect to the ownership of options to purchase the underlying security being shorted.

In addition to the risks of securities loan recalls or “short squeezes,” the Funds or Managed Accounts  may  be  required  to  provide  additional  margin  to  its  counterparties,  including  its prime brokers, on short notice if the price of a security underlying a short position suddenly rises. If a Fund or Managed Account is unable to deliver the additional margin required, Melvin Capital  may  need  to  prematurely  close  out  the  short  position  at  unattractive  prices,  thereby resulting in a substantial loss. In addition, depending on the timing and magnitude of a price increase in respect of an open short position, Melvin Capital may be required to liquidate long positions  in  order  to  meet  margin  requirements,  thereby  further  increasing  the  losses  (or decreasing the gains) of a Fund or Managed Account."

So what? Surely this is just the same old boring warning that they always include?

Well, previous versions of this document have proved very difficult for me to find, but I did manage to find a copy of the March 18th 2020 version. I'm sorry for the link, but it was the only one I could find, and requires you to download the document as a pdf.

So what did they say about risks last year? See section 8, page 13, which states:

"Short Sales. Short sales can, in certain circumstances, substantially increase the impact of 
adverse price movements on client’s portfolios. A short sale involves the risk of a theoretically 
unlimited increase in the market price of the particular investment sold short, which could 
result in an inability to cover the short position and a theoretically unlimited loss. There can be 
no assurance that securities necessary to cover short positions will be available for purchase."

No mention of a short squeeze, let alone two paragraphs explaining the multitude of ways they can occur. 

Seems like GameStop isn't the only company that thinks it is socially responsible to warn of the dangers of a short squeeze!! 

And Melvin, to their credit, reported this a full two weeks before GameStop!! Who says they are the bad guys in all this?! 

Coming back to the AUM and the RAUM difference, it appears that the RAUM is all the securities that they provide "continuous and regular supervisory or management services" over. 

See this website for details of how to calculate RAUM:

https://www.wagnerlawgroup.com/resources/investment/calculating-regulatory-assets-under-management

RAUM includes an account where:

"The adviser does not have discretionary authority over the account, but does have on-going responsibility to select or make recommendations, based upon the needs of the client, as to specific securities or other investments the account may purchase and sell and, if such recommendations are accepted by the client, the adviser is responsible for arranging or effecting the purchase or sale."

You'll notice from the Docoh site that Melvin has both onshore and offshore accounts. Only the onshore accounts are used to calculate the $13.1 billion of AUM. 

If my smooth brain is understanding this correctly, if Melvin is providing continuous advice to the offshore funds then their holdings would also be included in the RAUM. This would explain the discrepancy. 

So, Melvin (onshore) started 2021 with $12.5 billion in assets, have lost 49% of their value up to the end of March, meaning only $6.375B of that $12.5B remains. They had a $2.75B ~~bail out~~ investment from Citadel and Point72 on the 25th of January.

See:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340 

By my math they should have about $9.125B in assets now.

Seems like sometime between the end of January and the end of March someone has made another ~~bail out~~ investment of around $4B.

That's a significant amount to invest in a firm that hit headlines around the world for a 53% loss in one month. Just goes to show that there's no such thing as bad publicity...!

**TLDR - Melvin Capital have added the risk of a Short Squeeze, and a lot of detail as to how it might happen and the effect it might have, into their brochure for the first time. They also appear to have received an extra $4B since January that hasn't been mentioned elsewhere.**
