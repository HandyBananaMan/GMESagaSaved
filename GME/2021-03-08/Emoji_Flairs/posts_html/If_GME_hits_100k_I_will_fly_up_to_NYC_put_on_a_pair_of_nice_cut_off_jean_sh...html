<h1>Title: If GME hits $100k I will fly up to NYC, put on a pair of nice cut off jean shorts, a tank top that says "GME Millionaire", flip flops, and post up outside of Citadel sitting in a lawn chair. I'll also bring a cooler filled with tall boy PBR's and share with whatever Apes who want to join.</h1>
