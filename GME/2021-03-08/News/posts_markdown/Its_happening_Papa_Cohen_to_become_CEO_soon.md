(Reuters) - GameStop  Corp(GME) has tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to  lead a shift towards e-commerce, Bloomberg reported on Monday,  sending the company's shares up 10.3% before the bell.  Cohen's RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop(GME) in January, giving  Cohen seats on the company's board.  (Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by  Bernard Orr)

EDIT; I can't edit the headline and was too excited to proofread, the news doesn't state Papa Cohen is going to be CEO, but it honestly feels it's kind of inevitable at this point and just a matter of time I imagine. Sorry for any mislead. I LOVE YOU ALL, KBYE.
