<p>Not a peep from CNBC. </p>
<p>Not a peep from The Fool.</p>
<p>Not a peep from Fox.</p>
<p>Not a peep from the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Not a peep from Forbes. </p>
<p>Remember these institutions going forward, and remember they do not have your best interests at heart. EVER.</p>
<p>They will endlessly promote their masters agendas and they will never influence you to act in a way that will benefit you.</p>
<p>ALL ABOARD APES 🚀 🦍</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for my first gold ever! You guys are amazing and I’m proud of this community and all you hyper-rational apes 🦧</p>
