Not a peep from CNBC. 

Not a peep from The Fool.

Not a peep from Fox.

Not a peep from the Wall Street Journal.

Not a peep from Forbes. 

Remember these institutions going forward, and remember they do not have your best interests at heart. EVER.

They will endlessly promote their masters agendas and they will never influence you to act in a way that will benefit you.

ALL ABOARD APES 🚀 🦍

Edit: thanks for my first gold ever! You guys are amazing and I’m proud of this community and all you hyper-rational apes 🦧
