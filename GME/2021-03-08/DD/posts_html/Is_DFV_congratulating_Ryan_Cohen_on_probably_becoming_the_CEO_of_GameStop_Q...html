<p><strong>Hints I found so far:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>69 Coins and 420 lives. In the original video it is 72 and 75. So he or someone for him edited that into the video. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrAXCWpOlg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwrAXCWpOlg</a></li>
<li>Mario is wearing a frog costume while throwing an ice cream cone. In the original video that cone is a magical wand. But the fact that he is wearing a frog costume and DFV added an ice cream cone, seems to refer to Ryan Cohnes tweet. (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289">https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289</a>)</li>
<li>EDIT: Toad says "Oh me, oh my! You've been transformed! And asks: <strong>Shall I change you back with this "cone</strong>" (in the original "wand")? Again refering to Cohens Tweet and probably refering to GameStop hopefully becoming loved again by Ryan Cohen transforming it back to a beloved store we all know.</li>
<li>The blue box in the middle in the bottom right contains the <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/116497/gamestops-redesigned-powerup-rewards-program-cuts-used-game-discount">GameStop Power-Up Rewards Logo</a>, which is not in the original Video! (Thx to <img alt="akgogreen" src="https://www.reddit.com/user/akgogreen/" />, who told me this is the logo!)</li>
<li>The GameStop Logo also next to the Super Mushroom, which makes you a lot larger in the Game. This might mean Mushroom + GameStop = Becoming really big.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>MY Conclusion</strong>: It looks like DFV is congratulating Ryan Cohen to becoming the new "king" by several news outlets hinting, that he might become the ceo soon, thus sitting in the kings throne and getting the ice cream cone thrown at in the Tweet.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Another Message in the Video:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After stomping the final Boss (Shitadel &amp; Friends), the score goes to over 500k at the bottom. We all know what that could refer to. :) (Thx to u/Cography for bringing it to my attention!)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am analyzing the original video and the tweet at the moment, maybe I will find some more hints.</p>
