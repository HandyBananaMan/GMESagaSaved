<p>I've said this as a comment before, but I think it should be said again...</p>
<p>Once this has all played out, and ü¶ç have all their tendies....</p>
<p>PLEASE BUY BACK INTO GME!!!</p>
<p>Don't leave them hanging after DFV, RC and the Ape Nation saved them from the evil HFs. Show them support in stock purchases and patronage and slap all the analysts in the face that have said this stock isn't worth a damn. </p>
<p>I like the stock.....bought my PS3 from them back in 08 at the MCAS Miramar GameStop. And that was the only place I went to buy for console gaming. And with their transition to PC gaming, I'm looking forward to the future.</p>
<p>My plan (not financial advice) is to set 1 shares worth of whatever the sell price ends up being and buy back in after the stock settles, say a couple weeks after.</p>
<p>I know a bunch of apes want to help family, friends and their community, but don't forget about the little stock got you there.....</p>
