Show them support in stock purchases and patronage and slap all the analysts in the face that have said this stock isn't worth a damn. \n\nI like the stock.....bought my PS3 from them back in 08 at the MCAS Miramar GameStop. And that was the only place I went to buy for console gaming. And with their transition to PC gaming, I'm looking forward to the future.\n\nMy plan (not financial advice) is to set 1 shares worth of whatever the sell price ends up being and buy back in after the stock settles, say a couple weeks after.\n\nI know a bunch of apes want to help family, friends and their community, but don't forget about the little stock got you there.....",
