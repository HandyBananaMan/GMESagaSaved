Being of the way of the autist, I read every damn thing including the **fine** **print**.\n\n**Fine print:**  *Under New York Stock Exchange rules, brokers may vote \"routine\" matters at their discretion if your voting instructions are not communicated to us at least 15 days before the meeting.  We will nevertheless follow your instructions, even if the broker's discretionary vote has already been given, provided your instructions are received prior to the meeting date.*\n\nWhile it says they'll still follow voting instructions if you vote prior to the deadline, why even give a broker an opportunity to exercise a discretionary vote for you in the first place?  I have voted twice now thru both my brokers and it takes less than 2 minutes as it's super simple to vote inline with the board recommendations of \"FOR\" all 8 voting items.  GO VOTE!  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
