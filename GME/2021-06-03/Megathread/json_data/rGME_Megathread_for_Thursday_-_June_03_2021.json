And if that was happening, and those liabilities grew bigger and bigger, then federal regulators could see the outlines of the scheme on any financial statement.\"* that last line very interesting \ud83d\udc40 considering they can't afford to keep shorting GME now (remember the reverse repo market/Hyperinflation Shitedlas Illegal Money Short Printer is causing). it will be intresting for \ud83e\udd8ds to see how this pans out \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n* Here's some information on the AMC FOMO creation happening (i felt i should address some of this since the subs constantly being hit with AMC comments/posts) an \ud83e\udd8d posted up the [gains comparison on volume](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nqxzb2/gme_v_amc_today_6221/h0dj6yz?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3), they are even pushing AMC on [GME ticker searches](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/npx2wm/shills_are_not_even_trying_anymore/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), even an \ud83e\udd8d is smelling something fishy [when even the broker starts pushing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/npycqn/so_my_broker_trade_republik_thinks_i_need_to_know/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). If you need another reminders that GME is special, the [OBV is 142 Billion](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/npx017/obv_on_balance_volume_just_went_to_142_billion/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n* Also in case you haven't heard [the Dip Machines broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/no8tap/dip_machine_broken_but_tits_jacking_machine_is_at/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), all of this together shows they are using FOMO to buy more time for GME \ud83d\ude80, imagine if that FOMO pressure from Gamestop Tweets, RC tweets, and [DFV Tweeting again](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nqmioj/holy_fuck_tits_jacked/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), was put into GME, into the MOASSOAT where would \ud83d\ude80 be? (Disclaimer: im not saying AMC won't Squeeze im saying it isn't GME, im still \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4cing AMC from January, but GME is the last Squeeze to be sqoozed)\n* Moving back onto what this Subs about we have [GME Investor Meetings](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nr1m9x/just_so_everyone_is_aware_2_meetings_on_the_9rh/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) coming up, make sure to check out gamestops website [https://news.gamestop.com](https://news.gamestop.com) , there's some good news to talk about for the meeting about gamestops impact on the world, it looks like [1/6 of teens are now learning about finances](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nqlt7m/a_third_of_teens_say_they_are_learning_financial/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) because of \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8ds and Gamestop \ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57.\n* To Close here's you semi daily reminder to [Remember the fuckery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqmz4u/breaking_goldman_sachs_co_fail_to_reconstruct_at/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and with it a reminder to be safe \ud83e\udd8ds there aren't just shills, [but scammers too](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/npznsx/beware_personal_information_solicitation_messages/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n* As Always make sure to check out our previous daily for Important/Notable News, Buy, Hodl, Vote (None of this is financial advise)\n\nImportant **Proxy Statement Website and Phishing Scam** Announcement \u274e: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nhl6c4/proxy_vote_information/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nGeneral Information:\n\n* Flair Edit Tutorial: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nhl8gf/self_flair_edit_tutorial/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n* [Flair Filter Short Cut](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nhldn1/flair_search_short_cut/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) Feel free to report misflaired posts.\n* Karma-farming AutoMod Update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n798v4/state\\_of\\_the\\_sub\\_karma\\_farming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n798v4/state_of_the_sub_karma_farming/)\n* AMC Content Update: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ncs0eq/rgme\\_megathread\\_for\\_saturday\\_may\\_15\\_2021/gy6x33d?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ncs0eq/rgme_megathread_for_saturday_may_15_2021/gy6x33d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* If your post has been inappropriately removed, please contact ModMail **if it does not break any rules**.\n* If you have been inappropriately banned, please contact ModMail.
