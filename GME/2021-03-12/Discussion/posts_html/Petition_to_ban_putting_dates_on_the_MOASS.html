<p>A) it gives away shit to the enemy. It'll give them the perfect day to save up their shortable shares, dump them on that day and scare the paperhands</p>
<p>B) if/when it doesn't happen on that day, it spreads FUD, especially among new people</p>
<p>C) it's not fucking necessary. We've waited months, does it matter if it happens next week or next year?</p>
