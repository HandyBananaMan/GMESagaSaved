A) it gives away shit to the enemy. It'll give them the perfect day to save up their shortable shares, dump them on that day and scare the paperhands

B) if/when it doesn't happen on that day, it spreads FUD, especially among new people

C) it's not fucking necessary. We've waited months, does it matter if it happens next week or next year?
