<p>I’m back, dipshits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amount of whining I’ve heard in the last 24 hours is fucking pathetic, and you should all be ashamed of yourselves and the failures you’ve become. Listening to y’all is worse than the most unenthusiastic, driest, toothiest, herpes-infestedest blowjob on the fucking planet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging by your responses to my last post, most of you are incapable or unwilling to read some simple fucking sentences telling you to go eat dogshit, so I’m going to try out of the goodness of my benevolent heart to bestow wisdom on you grabasstic fuckclowns one more time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, we did not squeeze yesterday and we did not squeeze today. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m375cb/chill_the_fuck_out_you_basic_bitches_were_gonna/">As I said previously</a>, <strong>THAT’S FUCKING OKAY.</strong> It’s ok for me personally because I didn’t invest more than I could afford to lose unlike some of you useless bottomfeeders. It’s also ok for me personally because, while the theory about the call options did not come true, that was just one of a ton of elevating factors that I’m using to determine whether a squeeze can rip the microtesticles off of the hedge funds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now before I continue I want to make something crystal clear to you, twinkletits. <strong>I am not and nor have I advised that any of you should buy, that any of you should hold, or that any of you should pussy out and panic sell like the drooling bitches I know you are. That would be financial advice, and even though I struggle to stuff my massive dick into my pants every morning, I’m not a financial advisor.</strong> Financial advisors cost a shitload of money per hour, more than you or your wife’s six boyfriends can afford, the dirty little minx. You think one of them would come onto the internet and share their profession for fucking free? Do you also think that plants grow upward because they are seeking the motherfucking word of God?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s your first bit of knowledge: anyone offering you free financial advice and telling you to buy probably already has a sizeable long position, and stands to benefit materially from your dumb asses piling into their pump-and-dump. Anyone telling you to sell probably has a sizeable short position, and stands to rake your moronic asses over the fire because you can’t be bothered to look shit up for yourself. They’re like gas station sushi or your mom telling me I don’t need to use a condom with her cuz she’s clean – I don’t trust that shit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen up, Cuckleberry Finn. I’m about to make several claims in this post which I believe to be true based upon the extensive research I’ve done over the last few weeks. I know you haven’t done that research, because you’re standing there with your mouth open reading this fucking post. Your job is not to follow these claims blindly because let’s face it, you don’t know your left hand from your right hand, you don’t know your cock from your taint, and you don’t know if these are true or horseshit. It is your fucking job to research these claims and figure out whether they hold water, then make your own decisions. You’ve done a lackluster job in life running on your own decisions so far – fucking change that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a whole stack of shit going down that says something ain’t right with the rainbow bears. A lot of things are happening nearly at the same time, and these events all conflagrating simmmmmmultaneously tell me that I’m going to make some sick fucking cash come tendie judgement day. I’m going to include links because you NEET little bitchtits are too lazy and shiftless to plow keywords into a motherfucking search engine. Oh, and more items like these will probably pop up over the weekend. Don’t worry, Daddy bikebike will be here to harass you as you fail to comprehend what they mean. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM AM I PREDICTING THE SQUEEZE TO HAPPEN ON ANY OF THESE DATES. I JUST SEE A LOT OF SHIT DROPPING FROM GOD'S ASSHOLE AT THE SAME TIME AND I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD KEEP MY EYE ON IT. DON'T PEG AN ABSOLUTE DATE TO ANYTHING YOU VACUOUS CUNTS.</h1>

<li>Stimulus checks are dropping starting this weekend, and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stimulus-checks-young-people-millennials-planning-to-invest-in-stocks-2021-3-1030160755">a whopping 40% - 50% of those polled plan to put half of that delicious stimmie money in the stock market.</a> I wonder if that has anything in common with the 9.5 million mostly new users signing up to /r/wsb.</li>
<li>Some wrinklebrained Newton has written up a <a href="https://www.stockholdersrights.com/">shareholder letter</a>, deliverable to the Gamestop board next week, which demands that they recall all shares to call a vote. If they recall all shares, shorts must cover then and there, and this massive fraud complex is going to be exposed faster than what a failure your life is when you show up to your high school reunion and realize how much better off everyone is doing than you. Last post I linked that shit, I recommended you sign it, and I stand the fuck by that. In fact that is the only thing I’m recommending that you do other than your own DD. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx6sbk/gme_bonds_maturing_150321/">GME sold a bunch of bonds back in 2016, and those bonds mature on 3/15.</a> Shorts betted that GME would never turn around, so these bonds would never pay out. Bet they’re eating a jizz sandwich courtesy of RC and the boyz. </li>
<li>Congress is getting ready to ram the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/experts-to-take-aim-at-robinhood-model-during-gamestop-senate-hearing-11615235333">long dick of the public beatdown</a> up robinhood and the hedge funds’ asses all over again on 3/17. Do you think Vladdy-waddy’s booty-wooty can handle the onslaught this time? </li>
<li>~~401(k)’s are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin_capital_potentially_moving_investors/">moving out of Melvin Capital on 3/18.</a> But how could this be? Melvin swears up and down, it fucking PWOMISES that it’s doing great. Business has never been better despite it losing 58% of its entire value last month. Well then why the fuck are 401(k)’s divesting from such a fucking winner?~~ corrected by /u/the_captain_slog <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3xb8r/comment/gqrl6wr">here</a> see? I can factor in shit as I find it from other DD's because I'm never stagnant, you shitstains. <strong>ALWAYS BE RESEARCHING AND LEARNING.</strong> </li>
<li>Quadruple Witching Day is still 3/19. These witches ain’t bitches; they know what’s up. They smell blood in the water and can’t wait to menstruate all over these greedy pricks. </li>
<li>The State Street Global Advisors' SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d9c8383-a083-44a3-9c7e-54bb36c95a51">rebalances on 3/19</a>. </li>
<li>The new DTCC rule is looking at Melvin and Citadel with beer goggles and a throbbing semi.</li>
<li>GME is dropping a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/09/2189924/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Earnings-Release-Date.html">phat fucking earnings call on 3/23.</a> I feel like this one’s gonna be hella positive. How many of you cucks have bought Nintendo Switches and shit in the last few months? Don’t tell me you haven’t grabbed an extra Zelda figurine or two to jack off to at night while you listen to your wives slobbering on Chad Thundercock’s meat tornado through the wall. </li>

<p>That’s ~~nine~~ eight fucking items, each of which could individually cause a squeeze. So my analysis of the call options was wrong. I’m not a fucking evolutionary economist, but I bet I’m smarter than you diabetic lumps of beef fat. 2 wrong, 8 correct, I’m still listening to the majority here. I still think a squeeze is fucking on, and I’m still deep in this hoe. I’m so convicted that even though I’m only holding 16 (I bought one more today) shares I’m over here taking massive bong rips and dropping more intelligent DD than most of you assblasters can even dream of. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now here’s where your obligations come in. You, you minions of moronity, you chuds of conformity, you basement dwelling larvae, you LOWEST FUCKING COMMON DENOMINATORS, need to assume that everything I just said is total bullshit. You need to go fact-check it. You need to see if there are other factors that could cause this, or other ways that this whole hog-fucking pony show could go tits up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can think of one. The government could step in and say “party’s over, y’all have to go home now.” Now go do some research as to why or why not that could happen. Betcha there’s a lot more, pro and con. There’s a whole comments section to post them in. I don’t give a fuck what happens to you, but I’m providing you information and a space in which to analyze it. If you choose to cram it up your twats and light it on fire, I can’t and won’t save you from yourselves. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s fucking incredible, honestly. I heard so much pissing and moaning and dickwringing in the last post. “OMG SQUEEZE WHEN, SHOULD I SELL, SHOULD I BUY, PLEASE TELL ME O DARK LORD, I’M INCAPABLE OF HOLDING MY COCK WHILE I PISS AND NOT BLASTING MYSELF WITH A FRESH STEAMY STREAM OF HOT GOLDEN UREA.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you dickskins have an iota of experience, but most of you are clueless, so I’ll dumb down to you. It costs like three ATP molecules to get a grip of your micropenis and use its sad little tip to type “how does the stock market work?” into google. And then you click on shit that you don’t recognize, and you read. You keep clicking on shit till there ain’t any more words that don’t make sense to your pecan-sized protobrains. With any luck, some shit will osmose through your obtuse skulls and you'll become better traders for it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here’s the deal. Three months ago I wasn’t investing seriously, I wasn’t paying attention, I didn’t know what limit orders were or calls or puts or naked shorts or the DTCC or the SEC or anything. I sacked money away in a normal-ass 401(k), threw a little in Betterment and VTI every month, fucked my girlfriend three times a week in two different positions, bought tickers I didn’t recognize cuz I thought they were funny, and felt great when I made 10%. I thought a hedge fund was the cost you paid a gardener to come trim up your fucking yard because all of you pinche gringos are so allergic to the sun that you dare not venture outside and get your pasty, clammy little hands dirty. But before I threw my hard-earned cash into $GME, I realized the mechanisms of this trade were unlike anything that has ever happened before, and I needed to understand the whirlpool of crazy shit in front of me before jumping in. So I decided it was worth my time to learn about what I would be risking it on. So I researched. I worked hard. Literally 4 to 8 hours a day on average. I hauled ass to move my brain up to a level capable of doing more than drooling on my shirt. I ready every post i could find on wsb, watched every single Roaring Kitty video, and looked up every term i didn't recognize. I'm still not a fucking expert and you get bet your fucking ass I'll be pursuing improvement every day, because I piss excellence and I refuse to half-ass anything. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what do you do now? Odds are you aren’t gonna do shit. You’re gonna piss and moan and blame your shitty financial decisions on bad luck while smarter people than you fleece you for all you fucking have. Good luck getting equal visitation rights to your dumbfuck children after that. Nobody likes your kids, by the way, because they were raised by a dumbfuck parent like you. They make C’s, they can’t kick a fucking ball, and they’re going to end up as unremarkable shitstains listening to Top 40 radio, droning away in cubicles, and driving domestic shitboxes that break down every three years. They’ll shit out two to four crotchfruit who are equally worthless and then bumble around for the rest of their lives until the inevitable tide of progress drags them to an ignominious death. Nobody will remember them or you, because they will suck, because y’all fucking suck. You suck at life, you suck at finances, you suck at cooking, you suck at dating, you suck at fucking, and nobody gives a milliliter of syphilitic discharge about you. You COULD change that of course, but that would require effort, something which I’ve realized by now most of y’all are allergic to. You’ll probably just spend the next few years spanking it to furry porn until your choads get calluses, until one day you blink and realize holy fuck you’re 35 and worthless. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of you need to take the crayons out of your turdcutters and use them to draw some fucking charts or something before you eat them. You fucking mutants would make me pray for another worldwide plague, but the current one is taking out population tranches outside of dumbasses, flat-earthers, and anti-vaxxers so I’ll just settle for the hope that Boeings fall out of the sky onto your fucking houses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about you fucking ask Alexa what 0DTE calls are, or how a credit spread works, or what the fuck delta hedging is, instead of sitting on your widening asses playing Madden and watching Netflix until you literally grow into and merge with your own couches? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hit the fucking books you hideously deformed little bastards. I’m going to go shopping for a Gucci cock ring to match the engravings on my diamond fucking balls. If y’all wanna take this post as financial fucking advice, or advice to do anything other than your own research, then get rekt.</p>

<p>What these bastards are doing is criminal, and your grandmother is going to end up in the poorhouse because of them. And you, being the incapable pile of ass that you are, won’t be able to help her unless you fucking take action. Hold them accountable. </p>

<p>Honestly, the person/people who got that letter together are maybe the only redeeming humans out of the entire lot of you pathetic chucklefucks. With the exception of rensole and pixel too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And any of you who gild or otherwise award this post deserve the complete and abject black hole of failure that your life will inevitably become. I don’t want your fucking recognition or your karma, I want you to learn to fish for your fucking selves. The only reason I’m on reddit is to shove hot popcorn in my mouth while I watch you all implode over your poor decisions as your mom gives me a luxuriant handie using virgin coconut oil. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m going to go enjoy an all-you-can-eat pussy buffet. I just want you all to know that I hate you.</p>
