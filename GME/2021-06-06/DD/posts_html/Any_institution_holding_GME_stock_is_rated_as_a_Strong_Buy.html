<p>I'm just looking up <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings">GME's top institutional investors</a> who increased their holdings of GME on <a href="https://uk.investing.com/">investing.com</a>. Wouldn't you know it, JP Morgan, Principle Financial, Ameriprise, Prudential Financial, all of them are rated as a "Strong Buy".</p>
<p>You know who else is a strong buy? Bank of America, Jeffries, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. All of these guys <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-blocks-short-sells-gamestop-174600093.html">banned short selling of GME</a>.</p>
<p>That's interesting. Who is listed as a Strong Sell? Citadel, obviously. Credit Suisse, and we know that they are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfjsoy/credit_suisse_had_a_100000_put_position_on_gme/">in trouble with GME</a> . Deutche Bank, didn't a <a href="https://twitter.com/davidenrich/status/1383206855263019009?lang=en">whistleblower from there just go missing</a>? He might have been found but I need someone to give me a link to confirm. Barclays, aka <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nh35yo/barclays_citadels_clearing_broker_was_fined/">Citadel's clearing broker</a> .</p>
<p>Wow, it seems that everyone holding GME is the hottest stock available and everyone shorting needs to be dumped immediately. </p>
<p>Not financial advice but this is some nice confirmation of my choice to Buy and Hold GME.</p>
