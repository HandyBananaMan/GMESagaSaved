I'm just looking up [GME's top institutional investors](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) who increased their holdings of GME on [investing.com](https://uk.investing.com/). Wouldn't you know it, JP Morgan, Principle Financial, Ameriprise, Prudential Financial, all of them are rated as a "Strong Buy".

You know who else is a strong buy? Bank of America, Jeffries, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. All of these guys [banned short selling of GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jefferies-blocks-short-sells-gamestop-174600093.html).

That's interesting. Who is listed as a Strong Sell? Citadel, obviously. Credit Suisse, and we know that they are [in trouble with GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfjsoy/credit_suisse_had_a_100000_put_position_on_gme/) . Deutche Bank, didn't a [whistleblower from there just go missing](https://twitter.com/davidenrich/status/1383206855263019009?lang=en)? He might have been found but I need someone to give me a link to confirm. Barclays, aka [Citadel's clearing broker](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nh35yo/barclays_citadels_clearing_broker_was_fined/) .

Wow, it seems that everyone holding GME is the hottest stock available and everyone shorting needs to be dumped immediately. 

Not financial advice but this is some nice confirmation of my choice to Buy and Hold GME.
