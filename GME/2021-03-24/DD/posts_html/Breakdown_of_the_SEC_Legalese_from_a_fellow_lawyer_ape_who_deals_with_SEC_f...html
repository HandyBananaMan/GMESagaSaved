<p>*NOT FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. THIS IS JUST HOW I, AS A FELLOW APE WITH A LAW DEGREE FROM APE UNIVERSITY WHO ALSO READS SEC FILINGS FOR A LIVING, UNDERSTANDS THE INFORMATION IN GAMESTOP'S SEC FILING. THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. IN SHORT, I LIKE THE STOCK.  <strong>üíéüëê</strong>  <strong>üöÄüöÄüöÄ</strong></p>

<p><strong>TLDR APE SUMMARY</strong> ü¶çü¶çü¶ç:</p>
<ul>
<li>SEC filings are legally binding documents and the information within can be used against companies in court proceedings.</li>
<li>GME has no obligation to include any information about anything after their fiscal year, January 31, 2021, unless it's a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/cf-manual/topic-13">"subsequent event"</a>. To my knowledge, unless someone proves me wrong, speculating on a potential squeeze that may or may not happen in the future does NOT fall under this category.</li>
<li>GME confirmed that as of January 31, 2021, the stock was shorted over 100%</li>
<li>GME included LEGALLY BINDING information post-January 31, 2021, specifically about its stock, price volatility, and the short squeeze.</li>
<li>GME is basically saying that they are not responsible for any potential short squeezes that may or may not occur.</li>
<li>GME IS NOT CONFIRMING that a short squeeze will happen, because no one can predict the future. They are just saying that it's a possibility.</li>
<li>GME DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.</li>
<li>I'm almost 100% positive that their lawyers advised against including any post-fiscal information, because if I was GME's lawyer that is what I would have advised them in order to limit GME's potential liability, but the fact that it's included anyway, is KIND OF A BIG DEAL.</li>
<li>Why did they do this? Who knows? But this ape thinks it's to let everyone know what is going on, and to let everyone know that THEY ARE ALSO AWARE of what is going on.</li>
<li>UPDATE: I also like u/bigbrainbets's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/gs342si?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">theory</a> because it expands on my initial theory of why GME wants us to know that they know what's going on. Apes strong together!</li>
<li>THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE OR LEGAL ADVICE OR MEDICAL ADVICE. JUST MY OWN APE INTERPRETATION. DO WITH IT WHAT YOU WILL.</li>
<li>I like the stock and I will HODL.</li>

<p>Good morning my fellow Apes ü¶çü¶çü¶ç</p>
<p>I'm seeing a lot of different posts about interpretations and posts about the Gamestop SEC filing and what it means. I'm pretty excited to submit my first DD and contribute to this sub in a meaningful way, because while I'm only a smooth-brained ape when it comes to the stock market, I have a few wrinkles when it comes to SEC Filings.</p>
<p><strong>What is an SEC Filing?</strong></p>
<p>Publicly traded companies are required by the law to disclose relevant information concerning their business and corporate structure. The information enables investors to understand the company‚Äôs business model and helps them to predict the company‚Äôs future performance.</p>
<p>The following are the most common types of SEC filings:</p>
<ol>
<li>SEC Filings Form 10-K (THIS IS THE ONE WE ARE INTERESTED IN TODAY)</li>
<li>SEC Filings Form 10-Q</li>
<li>SEC Filings Form 8-K</li>
<li>SEC Filings Form S-1</li>
<li>Form S-4</li>
<li>SEC Filings Form 11-K</li>
</ol>
<p>Form <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/sec-10-k/">10-K</a> is a report that gives a comprehensive analysis of the company. It includes a detailed summary of the company‚Äôs results, <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/mda-management-discussion-analysis/">management discussions</a>, and audited financial statements. Companies are required to submit this filing within 90 days after the end of their fiscal year.</p>
<p><strong><em>APE INTERPRETATION</em></strong> ü¶çü¶çü¶ç:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Companies with stonks need to make their financial info public, so that apes with bananas can decide for themselves if they want to keep or sell their bananas. Financial information includes things like profit, loss, any potential lawsuits, and risks to the company.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Companies file 10-k reports at the end of each financial year. These reports describe the activities of the last financial year,</em></strong> <strong><em>NOT ACTIVITIES UP TO AND INCLUDING THE DAY OF FILING (THIS IS IMPORTANT)</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>These reports are professionally audited and reviewed/filed by lawyers, because any incorrect or misleading information can lead to huge lawsuits.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>INFORMATION IN AN SEC FILING IS THE MOST ACCURATE SOURCE OF INFORMATION YOU CAN FIND ON ANY COMPANY (unless that company is lying, which would be financial/business suicide).</em></strong></li>

<p>Everyone is excited about the Gamestop SEC Filing, and I'm seeing a lot of posts that, among other things, this CONFIRMS the percentage of shorts and other things.</p>
<p>THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCURATE, AND HERE IS WHY:</p>
<p>If you look at the TOP of the SEC filing, it clearly says</p>
<blockquote>

<li><strong><em>THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN THE SEC REPORT ONLY APPLIES TO THE TIME PERIOD OF FEBRUARY 1, 2020 TO JANUARY 31, 2021</em></strong></li>

Revenue recognition changed with the new 606 rules and how some is recognized (subscriptions, etc.). These differences can positively or negatively affect the company's financial outlook. If an external auditor found that some revenue or expenses were mis-categorized or used the old 605 rules as opposed to 606, this could materially ( <strong><em>ü¶ç</em></strong> speak: largely) affect their financial statements.         <strong><em>ü¶ç</em></strong> Speak: Accounting rule changes could affect their reported numbers for the better or worse.|The manner in which we fund tax withholding obligations that will arise upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock awards may require us to use a substantial amount of cash, which would reduce our liquidity, or may result in sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock into the market, <strong>which could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.</strong>                                                                           EDIT:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ReverseTickleMonster/">ReverseTickleMonster</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/gs26vh2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">28 minutes ago</a>'s input:  Am Ape, not advisor. Ape guesses that:   Because the 2019 rule is no longer referenced, I assume that they switched to 606 rules and this is no longer a concern. Now in 2020 They are concerned with setting aside an appropriate amount of cash to pay for taxes on vested restricted stock awards. The company can pay these taxes, or pass the tax bill to the individual if they so choose (unlikely). This is where we would look at available options for inside holders as well as institutional warrants. IF any are exercised that should create a taxable event. i believe that this is saying: <em>in the event that they have more restricted options/warrants exercised than budgeted, they may have to sell stock into the market to foot the bill</em>. However, exercising these options/warrants converts them into restricted stock, which wouldn't trade on the open market; this would lock these up for trading.

<p><strong>GAMESTOP SEC FILING: RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK</strong></p>
<p>The market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:</p>
<p><strong><em>(APE INTERPRETATION</em></strong> ü¶çü¶çü¶ç: <strong><em>the factors in this list are NOT EXHAUSTIVE. the "without limitation" DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE VALUE OF THE SQUEEZE IS WITHOUT LIMITATION. They even put a COLON after the words "without limitation" which in grammatical terms, indicates the beginning of a list, and therefore it's A FULL STOP, like a period.)</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>‚Äúshort squeezes‚Äù;</li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong><em>APE INTERPRETATION</em></strong> <strong><em>ü¶çü¶çü¶ç: NOTICE HOW SHORT SQUEEZE IS IN QUOTATIONS? That means they are using a specific definition for it, and their interpretation of what a short squeeze means should be in the document itself. the interpretation is further below)</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, <strong>message boards and social and other media</strong>;</li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong><em>APE INTERPRETATION</em></strong> <strong><em>ü¶çü¶çü¶ç: SHOUTOUT TO</em></strong> r/GME <strong><em>AND APES!!)</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>large stockholders exiting their position in our Class A Common Stock or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our Class A Common Stock;</li>
<li>actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;</li>
<li>risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;</li>
<li>the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches;</li>
<li>the timing of new store openings or closings;</li>
<li>shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings;</li>
<li>the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;</li>
<li>acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in;</li>
<li>the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate;</li>
<li>the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores;</li>
<li>changes in foreign currency exchange rates;</li>
<li>negative public perception of us, our competitors, or industry; and</li>
<li>overall general market fluctuations</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. <strong>During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume.</strong></p>
<p>(<strong><em>APE INTERPRETATION</em></strong> <strong><em>ü¶çü¶çü¶ç: THEY ARE BASICALLY SIGNALLING TO US THAT THE PRICE VOLATILITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMPANY ITSELF, THE COMPANY HAS REMAINED THE SAME, AND THIS IS BEING CAUSED BY OUTSIDE INFLUENCE - THEY HAD NO REASON TO DO THIS. THEY HAD NO REASON TO INCLUDE INFORMATION FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO IN THIS FILING, BUT THEY DID...)</em></strong></p>
<p>These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.</p>
<p><strong>GAMESTOP SEC FILINGS FORM 10-K: A ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.</strong></p>
<p>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.</p>
<p>This is often referred to as a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚Äù</p>
