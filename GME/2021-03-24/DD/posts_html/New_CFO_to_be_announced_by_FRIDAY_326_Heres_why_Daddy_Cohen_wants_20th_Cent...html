<p>Ladies and Gentleapes ü¶ç,</p>
<p>As you may already know, Jim Bell (CFO) is officially outta here this Friday, 3/26.</p>
<p>Did y'all forget what this means?! <strong>GME is going to announce a new CFO.</strong></p>
<p>But wait, there's more!</p>
<p>For any reason they don't find a replacement, <strong>Diana Jajeh</strong> will serve as interim/temp CFO (starting today).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/i3cfv6huf3p61.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f33db3da1285a9f2fd0d57688877934b777b96</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Well, to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my POV, and by considering each and every one's valid opinion, without offence, I honestly believe that...</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Cohen ain't no fooh!</strong></p>
<p>Now we know Daddy Cohen don't play and there's a high probability (according to my ape math) that he may have chosen a CFO already and this may be announced any time between now and Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3/26/21:</strong> Ape math wrong. Unfortunately, no announcement today about new CFO. Just a new SEC filing showing that Diana Jajeh will fill in for Jim Bell as temporary CFO.</p>
<p>She was granted <strong>2949 restricted shares of $GME</strong>, effective March 1, 2021. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>GME also has a brand spankin' new <strong>STAR-STUDDED Executive team</strong> lined up already, and Daddy Cohen ain't done yet.</p>
<p>But before we meet our new aunties and uncle, I just wanted to say with all due respect...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As u/rensole and other apes warned us, the price drop after earnings was expected.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>IT DOESN'T MATTER!</strong></p>
<p>GameStop's fundamentals are <strong>SOLID</strong> af.</p>
<p>No pain, no gain!</p>
<p>Even a Jefferies analyst (finally) <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-new-price-target-jefferies-reddit-traders-celebrating-2021-3-1030242026">increased her price target</a> for $GME from <strong>$15 to $175</strong>, as first posted by intelli-ape u/gorillaguz</p>
<p>This news has been making its rounds today on MSM.</p>
<p>The company is transitioning beautifully as Daddy Cohen has been cleaning out the C-suite, bringing in a team of wrinkled-af-brained executives.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Ape u/Vic18t wanted graph, ape got graph.</p>
<p>Sometimes all you gotta do is zoom out, just look at that beauty...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Don't forget, RC mentioned in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf">letter to the Board</a> back in Nov '20 how $GME <strong>"is also one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market."</strong></p>
<p>The squeeze is IMMINENT üöÄüöÄüöÄ</p>
<p>And regardless, just looking at the fundamentals ALONE, $GME will be sitting at <a href="https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1364369004270391296">quadruple digits.</a></p>
<p>Now add the short interest to the equation- although we don't have the correct data due to HFs manipulation tactics and naked shorts, the "reported" SI's currently at 52%.</p>
<p>We know this is BS and it's much much higher, but keep in mind that even at a conservative \~50%, that's STILL <strong>super high AF!</strong></p>
<p>This shiznitz is mooning one way or another.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/sfknr3qeo0p61.jpg?width=533&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e5331a4ec91a4e911a28a0227e31c527ad58b5b">When Roaring Kitty lands</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Forget Dates, It Will Happen When it Happens</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To put this into perspective, and for the sole purpose to serve as an example, let's take a quick look at the Tezzla (misspelled on purpose) squeezy.</p>
<p><strong>Tezzla didn't squeeze overnight.</strong> It took several months, it was a build up.</p>
<p>It started slowly in Oct '19 and it wasn't until Feb '20 that it made major headlines as the stock nearly hit $1k.</p>
<p>But guess what happened a few weeks later? The share price tumbled more than 50%.</p>
<p>It wasn't over yet, though.</p>
<p>The stock price began to increase for months to come.</p>
<p>It reached an all time high of  <strong>$4,502</strong> in <strong>January 2021</strong> [share price was $900.40 since Tezzla did a 5-for-1 stock split in August '20, so <strong>$900.40 x 5 = $4502</strong>]</p>
<p>Data is from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?p=TSLA">Yahoo Finance historical price.</a></p>
<p>Again, different company, different fundamentals. It took Tezzla longer to squeeze because of the pandemic, which resulted in Tesla having to shutdown their Fremont, CA factory.</p>
<p><strong>GME is a COMPLETELY different animal!</strong></p>
<p>GameStop was shorted nearly <strong>150%</strong> (may even be much higher now due to naked shorting, we don't know for sure).</p>
<p>Tezz was shorted \~<strong>20%.</strong></p>
<p>LET THAT SINK IN.</p>
<p>Now, I get there are noobie apes here who may have questions about the squoze of the century. Let's help each other out and edumacate when possible.</p>

<p>We good now? Alright, let's meet our all-stars!</p>
<h1>New Star-Studded $GME Lineup</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm <strong>SUPER STOKED</strong> about the new team RC is reviving GME with.</p>
<p>I mean this big daddy hunka dunka first-ever gazillionaire is Chewifying the shiznitz out of GME and I'm here for it.</p>
<p>Apes, without further ado, let me introduce you to <strong>GameStop's New COO-</strong></p>
<h1><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-owens?trk=people-guest_people_search-card">Jenna Owens</a>, Chief Operating Officer (COO)</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/tp2acegko0p61.jpg?width=372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30fd81c8c5e23f6a2fd998fbe3a0f4853322c731">Aunty Jenna</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Aunty J has nearly <strong>20 yrs experience</strong> in Tech/Ops and recently worked as the Director and General Manager for Distribution and Multi-Channel Fulfillment at <strong>Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p>She has also worked at Google for 4+ years.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced/Skills:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Product Engineering</li>
<li>Technology Operations</li>
<li>Supply Chain &amp; Store Operations</li>
<li>Launched Amazon Fresh Pickup, Whole Foods Pickup &amp; Delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Guys, this is a <strong>BIG</strong> deal! If you don't know what the role of a COO is, it's basically <strong>SECOND to the CEO-</strong> meaning typically second in the chain of commands and he/she carries out the company's long-term business plan.</p>
<p>Ok, so why exactly am I so juiced about this?</p>
<p>Now these are just MY thoughts, but <strong>I don't see Aunty J. working under the current boomer CEO George Sherman.</strong></p>
<p>He's the JCPenny/Sears of CEO's in the age of digital transformation. Grandpa clearly lacks strategic vision.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8t24orano0p61.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e14125993c03ef74f77a58c78f5abbf5621024bd">2 down, 1 to go</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Do I smell Daddy Cohen coming in soon? Possibly.</strong></p>
<p>Do you apes remember the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf">open letter</a> RC sent to GME's Board back in Nov 2020? Ape ü¶ç can't read? No worries, I gotchu!</p>
<p>Basically, <strong>RC blasted the Board</strong> in the most scholarly way possible. Here's a summary in ape lingo:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me make something very clear, get your sh*t together. I've invested a crap load of time analyzing GME's fundamentals and even reached out to the Board in the summer (2020). Yet y'all have barely made any progress. As you're aware, the recent increase in stock price was mainly due to my stake in $GME upon filing a 13D (oooh burn!!). It's clear that GameStop lacks the mindset and urgency to make changes to grow with gamers. <strong>George Sherman has an ancient mentality</strong> and is still focused on the 20th century physical store world, hindering the transition to digital. I urge GME to quickly provide stockholders with a credible roadmap.  </p>
<p><strong>TL,DR:</strong> F* you, I'm taking over with my peeps</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ok, it didn't go exactly like that but here's a snippet:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/mzwbr23ro0p61.png?width=749&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af2e6550a7950f05c3d90bf584e8c86f6b27fc87</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Worth mentioning, based on RC's past interviews, he likes to handle things without being in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Perhaps he may have more control sitting on the Board w/ a sh*t ton of stake in $GME and telling ppl wtf to do, rather than becoming the CEO himself.</p>
<p>If he doesn't takeover as CEO, <strong>it doesn't worry me one bit.</strong></p>
<p>RC may instead bring in someone forward-thinking and capable of taking GME to the next f*cking level.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=17c202905840">In his own words</a> about Chewy,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My biggest risk would have been not taking risk...The risk of <strong>hiring expensive executives even though we weren‚Äôt profitable.</strong> These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, <strong>I was not the most popular board member</strong>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again, just my thoughts. Either way, the company's future is looking bullish af and GME will dominate the market in the near future.</p>
<p>Trust the process apes!</p>

<p><strong>Motha-fudgin-CHEWY-baby!</strong></p>
<p>In fact, RC initially hired our sis FROM Amazon when he started Chewy! Hahaha he's such a G when it comes to ~~stealing~~ hiring star-studded talent.</p>
<p>And get this, she was a <strong>former investment banker</strong> at BMO Capital Markets (ready for the squoze sista?)</p>

<p>With over <strong>20 years</strong> experience under his belt in the e-comm, infotech and software engineering areas, Uncle Suzuki will lead GameStop's software suppy chain, order management and warehouse management system.</p>
<p>Basically he'll be the <strong>brains behind productivity</strong>: the flow of goods/products from the supplier to manufacturer, and finally to the end customer.</p>
<p>His role will help cut down on GME's expenses and deliver products/services faster to customers, which is something <strong>RC is huge on</strong> (one of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7igkm/a_tribute_to_the_original_papa_cohen_from_the/">5 principles his late father taught him</a>).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As DFV pointed out in his livestream, RC usually says NO to 99.9% of opportunities, but <strong>he said YES to GameStop!</strong></p>

<p>It costs us NOTHING to hold, but it's costing them millions upon millions every-single-f*cking-day.</p>
<p>It's only a matter of time before we moonwalk outta here.</p>
<p>For now just sit back, relax, enjoy earth and review your boarding pass to ensure all details are correct before takeoff.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> GME recently hired a sick a$$ team from Amazon, Chewy and Zulily. Calm down, eat a banana, enjoy earth for a little more. Moon soon.</p>
