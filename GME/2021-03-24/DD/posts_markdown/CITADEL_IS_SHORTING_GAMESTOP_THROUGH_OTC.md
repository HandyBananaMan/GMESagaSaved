CITADEL HAS BEEN SHORTING THROUGH OTC!!!

#WATCH THIS: [https://youtu.be/f44KvJjKdL8](https://youtu.be/f44KvJjKdL8)

**52% of total volume today was via** ***DARK POOLS!!!***

**Dark Pools:** 

* \- **Legal, done to not disrupt the market (order size)**
* \- **Hedgies, institutions, etc.** 
* \- **Order size is UNKNOWN in D.P** 
* \- **We retail have 0 access to D.P**
* \- **As of Feb. 2020, there are 50 D.P registered with the S.E.C**

**Shorts are avoiding SSR via OTC:** 

1. **1.** **Not regulated, but still tracked by FINRA**
2. **2.** **Who is a Market Maker?....Citadel**
3. **3.** **1.9 BILLION?!?!? (2x FLOAT) Over A 2 WEEK PERIOD**

&#x200B;

* \- **THEY ARE TRADING FAKE SHARES THAT DONT EXIST...**

**Short Exempt: allows shorts to short a stock on the down-tick despite SSR being in place, making SSR useless...** 

* \- **Market Makers allowed to short exemptâ€¦**
