# First of all, this sounds great, but I want to start this of by stating this does not mean the rule will come into effect immediately.

If you're not familiar with the **801**ðŸ’£ you can check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05AhD8QRW5I) out real quick. He does a pretty good job at explaining and keeping it interesting.

I've done quite a bit of research on this, but would like to point out that **this is not my wheelhouse** and I could be misinterpreting some of this information. I will provide my sources and am hoping that apes with more wrinkly brains can provide their input as well. If you find this helpful, please updoot for visibility.

We first learned about the SR-NSCC-2021-801 when SEC form 19b-4 was filed on the DTCC website on March 5th. SEC form 19b-4 is a form used to inform the SEC of a proposed rule change. Once the form is filed, the SEC has 60 days to object or approve. Today the SR-NSCC-2021-801 will be **officially published to the Federal Register**, which you can verify by going to the following site:

[https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2021/03/23](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2021/03/23)

If you scroll down to "National Securities Clearing Corp." you will see two documents that are scheduled to be published today, *SR-NSCC-2021-801* and *SR-NSCC-2021-002*.

&#x200B;

The intention of SR-NSCC-2021-801 was to provide **advanced notice** for the rule change mentioned in *SR-NSCC-2021-002*. This is weird because *SR-NSCC-2021-002* was filed on the same day that the **801**ðŸ’£ was filed (so much for "**advanced notice**"). I'm not familiar with the process, but it sounds like they are trying to get this rushed through. Anyways... this advanced notice allows for the public to review and submit comments. One of our homies has got our back and already submitted a comment of their own.

>"Dear SEC,

I removed their name because I don't want to break any rules on Reddit, but this is all on public record and you can view all of the comments at the link below.

So cool, now that the **801**ðŸ’£ and the rule change associated with it will be published, what's next? Basically, in order for the rule to come into effect, the SEC must not have any objections to the advanced notice *AND* must approve the rule change. What will happen today is  the DTCC will officially publish the advanced notice and rule change on their website.

Approval of the rule change can take **up to 45 days after the publication** of the notice. Approval **can happen sooner** if the SEC decides to approve the rule change before then, which most likely will be the case. I personally believe it is in their best interest to act sooner rather than later because the longer they wait the worse this situation gets for them.

Once the rule change has been approved by the SEC, the NSCC would then implement the proposed changes within 10 Business Days. The NSCC will announce the effective date of the proposed changes by "Important Notice" posted to their website.

So for you smooth brained apes out there, an easy way you can verify when the rule officially comes into effect is by bookmarking the link below and refreshing the page until you see the new rule pop up on the DTCC website. **PLEASE use refresh wisely, lets not give it the reddit hug of death...**

My guess is that the rule change will be approved by the SEC ASAP (could be today), and the NSCC will implement the rule ASAP (could be today as well). The longest this could be delayed is 55 days, unless there are objections and the SEC decides they would like to institute proceedings to determine if the rule should be approved or disapproved. Then that date can be extended by another 60 days, which I think is unlikely.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around it all, so if you find that I have misspoken, please let me know and I'll try to edit this post accordingly.

If anyone is curious, below is some more information on how the Federal Register works:

**TLDR:**

**801**ðŸ’£ and rule change will be officially published to the DTCC website today. SEC and NSCC can now approve both, and the new rule could be in effect as soon as today (no guarantee though). I linked a website you can use to verify check to see if the rule has been implemented.

**I think that's it guys, let me know if you have any questions and I'll try my best to answer. Happy holding!**
