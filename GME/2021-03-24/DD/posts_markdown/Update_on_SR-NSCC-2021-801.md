Hi fellow apes, (PLS UPVOTE SO EVERYONE IS CORRECTLY INFORMED)

I read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbx966/the_hedgies_are_about_to_be_margin_called/) post today and saw a lot of people commenting being happy thinking the rule is going into effect today. However, this is NOT TRUE (untill we see an update of the filling being implemented as stated in the filling.)

I actually read more than the first paragraph and found this:

## III. Date of Effectiveness of the Advance Notice, and Timing for Commission Action

The proposed change may be implemented if the Commission does not object to the proposed change within 60 days of the later of (i) the date that the proposed change was filed with the Commission or (ii) the date that any additional information requested by the Commission is received. The clearing agency shall not implement the proposed change if the Commission has any objection to the proposed change.

The Commission may extend the period for review by an additional 60 days if the proposed change raises novel or complex issues, subject to the Commission providing the clearing agency with prompt written notice of the extension. A proposed change may be implemented in less than 60 days from the date the advance notice is filed, or the date further information requested by the Commission is received, if the Commission notifies the clearing agency in writing that it does not object to the proposed change and authorizes the clearing agency to implement the proposed change on an earlier date, subject to any conditions imposed by the Commission.

The clearing agency shall post notice on its website of proposed changes that are implemented.

The proposal shall not take effect until all regulatory actions required with respect to the proposal are completed.

Hopefully, you guys understand that the squeeze is still on its way just stay calm and HODL.

Not financial advice of course just ape talk.

EDIT: KEEP UPDATED ON THIS WEBSITE TO SEE WHEN THE RULES COME INTO EFFECT : [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings)

EDIT 2: Apparently people/shills are downvoting this no idea why, just trying to keep the community well INFORMED

EDIT 3: Some people are attacking me saying I stated the rule is not going into effect tomorrow. However, I only spoke about TODAY. AND THE RULE IS NOT GOING INTO EFFECT TODAY! Could be tomorrow, could max be (roughly)100 days from now
