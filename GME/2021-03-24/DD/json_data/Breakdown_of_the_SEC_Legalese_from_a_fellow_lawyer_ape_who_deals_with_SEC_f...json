To my knowledge, unless someone proves me wrong, speculating on a potential squeeze that may or may not happen in the future does NOT fall under this category.\n* GME confirmed that as of January 31, 2021, the stock was shorted over 100%\n* GME included LEGALLY BINDING information post-January 31, 2021, specifically about its stock, price volatility, and the short squeeze.\n* GME is basically saying that they are not responsible for any potential short squeezes that may or may not occur.\n* GME IS NOT CONFIRMING that a short squeeze will happen, because no one can predict the future. They are just saying that it's a possibility.\n* GME DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.\n* I'm almost 100% positive that their lawyers advised against including any post-fiscal information, because if I was GME's lawyer that is what I would have advised them in order to limit GME's potential liability, but the fact that it's included anyway, is KIND OF A BIG DEAL.\n* Why did they do this? Who knows? But this ape thinks it's to let everyone know what is going on, and to let everyone know that THEY ARE ALSO AWARE of what is going on.\n   * UPDATE: I also like u/bigbrainbets's [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/gs342si?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) because it expands on my initial theory of why GME wants us to know that they know what's going on. Apes strong together!\n* THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE OR LEGAL ADVICE OR MEDICAL ADVICE. JUST MY OWN APE INTERPRETATION.

The information enables investors to understand the company\u2019s business model and helps them to predict the company\u2019s future performance.\n\nThe following are the most common types of SEC filings:\n\n1. SEC Filings Form 10-K (THIS IS THE ONE WE ARE INTERESTED IN TODAY)\n2. SEC Filings Form 10-Q\n3. SEC Filings Form 8-K\n4. SEC Filings Form S-1\n5. Form S-4\n6. SEC Filings Form 11-K\n\nForm [10-K](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/sec-10-k/) is a report that gives a comprehensive analysis of the company. It includes a detailed summary of the company\u2019s results, [management discussions](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/mda-management-discussion-analysis/), and audited financial statements. Companies are required to submit this filing within 90 days after the end of their fiscal year.\n\n***APE INTERPRETATION*** \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d:\n\n* ***Companies with stonks need to make their financial info public, so that apes with bananas can decide for themselves if they want to keep or sell their bananas.

Ape guesses that:   Because the 2019 rule is no longer referenced, I assume that they switched to 606 rules and this is no longer a concern. Now in 2020 They are concerned with setting aside an appropriate amount of cash to pay for taxes on vested restricted stock awards. The company can pay these taxes, or pass the tax bill to the individual if they so choose (unlikely). This is where we would look at available options for inside holders as well as institutional warrants. IF any are exercised that should create a taxable event. i believe that this is saying: *in the event that they have more restricted options/warrants exercised than budgeted, they may have to sell stock into the market to foot the bill*. However, exercising these options/warrants converts them into restricted stock, which wouldn't trade on the open market; this would lock these up for trading. Also keep in mind that they clearly state that they have SOME funds to cover taxes for this event already, which would more than likely cover the tax expense based on their prediction. ***\ud83e\udd8d*** Speak: They are covering their base in case restricted stocks are exercised by insiders.

To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.\n\nThis is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\n\n(***APE INTERPRETATION*** ***\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d: THE LAST TWO SENTENCES IN THAT PARAGRAPH IS THEIR INTERPRETATION OF A SHORT SQUEEZE - notice the words \"MAY\", which means it CAN happen but it's not GUARANTEED, as opposed to using, for example, \"SHALL\" or \"MUST\")***\n\nI hope this gives you a better understanding of how to read SEC documents, their significance, and things to look out for.",
