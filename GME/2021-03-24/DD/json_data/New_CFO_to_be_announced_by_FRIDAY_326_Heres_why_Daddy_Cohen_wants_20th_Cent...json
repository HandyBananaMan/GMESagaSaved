    "selftext": "Ladies and Gentleapes \ud83e\udd8d,\n\nAs you may already know, Jim Bell (CFO) is officially outta here this Friday, 3/26.\n\nDid y'all forget what this means?! **GME is going to announce a new CFO.**\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nFor any reason they don't find a replacement, **Diana Jajeh** will serve as interim/temp CFO (starting today).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i3cfv6huf3p61.jpg?width=200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15f33db3da1285a9f2fd0d57688877934b777b96\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my POV, and by considering each and every one's valid opinion, without offence, I honestly believe that...\n\n**Ryan Cohen ain't no fooh!**\n\nNow we know Daddy Cohen don't play and there's a high probability (according to my ape math) that he may have chosen a CFO already and this may be announced any time between now and Friday.\n\n**Edit 3/26/21:** Ape math wrong. Unfortunately, no announcement today about new CFO. Just a new SEC filing showing that Diana Jajeh will fill in for Jim Bell as temporary CFO.\n\nShe was granted **2949 restricted shares of $GME**, effective March 1, 2021. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1ezwkqjdgp61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8af5109733311ba7b8fde587e4270b378f6ab23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME also has a brand spankin' new **STAR-STUDDED Executive team** lined up already, and Daddy Cohen ain't done yet.\n\nBut before we meet our new aunties and uncle, I just wanted to say with all due respect...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z10rbdqgn0p61.jpg?width=458&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6f3e036e8157eb5a88518fc6e308068ee2ee5f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs u/rensole and other apes warned us, the price drop after earnings was expected.\n\nRemember, **IT DOESN'T MATTER!**\n\nGameStop's fundamentals are **SOLID** af.\n\nNo pain, no gain!\n\nEven a Jefferies analyst (finally) [increased her price target](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-new-price-target-jefferies-reddit-traders-celebrating-2021-3-1030242026) for $GME from **$15 to $175**, as first posted by intelli-ape u/gorillaguz\n\nThis news has been making its rounds today on MSM.\n\nThe company is transitioning beautifully as Daddy Cohen has been cleaning out the C-suite, bringing in a team of wrinkled-af-brained executives.\n\n**Edit:** Ape u/Vic18t wanted graph, ape got graph.\n\nSometimes all you gotta do is zoom out, just look at that beauty...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqldx28pe3p61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ebc483bea116057709f7d0704d9376af2b2a2f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't forget, RC mentioned in the [letter to the Board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) back in Nov '20 how $GME **\"is also one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market.\"**\n\nThe squeeze is IMMINENT \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd regardless, just looking at the fundamentals ALONE, $GME will be sitting at [quadruple digits.](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1364369004270391296)\n\nNow add the short interest to the equation- although we don't have the correct data due to HFs manipulation tactics and naked shorts, the \"reported\" SI's currently at 52%.\n\nWe know this is BS and it's much much higher, but keep in mind that even at a conservative \\~50%, that's STILL **super high AF!**\n\nThis shiznitz is mooning one way or another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[When Roaring Kitty lands](https://preview.redd.it/sfknr3qeo0p61.jpg?width=533&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e5331a4ec91a4e911a28a0227e31c527ad58b5b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Forget Dates, It Will Happen When it Happens\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo put this into perspective, and for the sole purpose to serve as an example, let's take a quick look at the Tezzla (misspelled on purpose) squeezy.\n\n**Tezzla didn't squeeze overnight.** It took several months, it was a build up.\n\nIt started slowly in Oct '19 and it wasn't until Feb '20 that it made major headlines as the stock nearly hit $1k.\n\nBut guess what happened a few weeks later? The share price tumbled more than 50%.\n\nIt wasn't over yet, though.\n\nThe stock price began to increase for months to come.\n\nIt reached an all time high of  **$4,502** in **January 2021** \\[share price was $900.40 since Tezzla did a 5-for-1 stock split in August '20, so **$900.40 x 5 = $4502**\\]\n\nData is from [Yahoo Finance historical price.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?p=TSLA)\n\nAgain, different company, different fundamentals. It took Tezzla longer to squeeze because of the pandemic, which resulted in Tesla having to shutdown their Fremont, CA factory.\n\n**GME is a COMPLETELY different animal!**\n\nGameStop was shorted nearly **150%** (may even be much higher now due to naked shorting, we don't know for sure).\n\nTezz was shorted \\~**20%.**\n\nLET THAT SINK IN.\n\nNow, I get there are noobie apes here who may have questions about the squoze of the century. Let's help each other out and edumacate when possible.\n\n\\*\\* **Here are some DD resources for the noobs:**\n\n**1.** [$GME Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4hqkc/gme_moass_faq/)\n\n**2.** [Starter Pack for Newcomers](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzxb35/gme_starter_pack/)\n\n**3.** [Compilation of ALL Due Diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj1wqv/a_comprehensive_compilation_of_all_due_diligence/), courtesy of organized ape u/thr0wthis4ccount4way\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe good now? Alright, let's meet our all-stars!\n\n# New Star-Studded $GME Lineup\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm **SUPER STOKED** about the new team RC is reviving GME with.\n\nI mean this big daddy hunka dunka first-ever gazillionaire is Chewifying the shiznitz out of GME and I'm here for it.\n\nApes, without further ado, let me introduce you to **GameStop's New COO-**\n\n# [Jenna Owens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenna-owens?trk=people-guest_people_search-card), Chief Operating Officer (COO)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Aunty Jenna](https://preview.redd.it/tp2acegko0p61.jpg?width=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30fd81c8c5e23f6a2fd998fbe3a0f4853322c731)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAunty J has nearly **20 yrs experience** in Tech/Ops and recently worked as the Director and General Manager for Distribution and Multi-Channel Fulfillment at **Amazon**.\n\nShe has also worked at Google for 4+ years.\n\n**Experienced/Skills:**\n\n* Product Engineering\n* Technology Operations\n* Supply Chain & Store Operations\n* Launched Amazon Fresh Pickup, Whole Foods Pickup & Delivery\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuys, this is a **BIG** deal! If you don't know what the role of a COO is, it's basically **SECOND to the CEO-** meaning typically second in the chain of commands and he/she carries out the company's long-term business plan.\n\nOk, so why exactly am I so juiced about this?\n\nNow these are just MY thoughts, but **I don't see Aunty J. working under the current boomer CEO George Sherman.**\n\nHe's the JCPenny/Sears of CEO's in the age of digital transformation. Grandpa clearly lacks strategic vision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2 down, 1 to go](https://preview.redd.it/8t24orano0p61.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=e14125993c03ef74f77a58c78f5abbf5621024bd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I smell Daddy Cohen coming in soon? Possibly.**\n\nDo you apes remember the [open letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) RC sent to GME's Board back in Nov 2020? Ape \ud83e\udd8d can't read? No worries, I gotchu!\n\nBasically, **RC blasted the Board** in the most scholarly way possible. Here's a summary in ape lingo:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Let me make something very clear, get your sh\\*t together. I've invested a crap load of time analyzing GME's fundamentals and even reached out to the Board in the summer (2020). Yet y'all have barely made any progress. As you're aware, the recent increase in stock price was mainly due to my stake in $GME upon filing a 13D (oooh burn!!). It's clear that GameStop lacks the mindset and urgency to make changes to grow with gamers. **George Sherman has an ancient mentality** and is still focused on the 20th century physical store world, hindering the transition to digital. I urge GME to quickly provide stockholders with a credible roadmap.  \n>  \n>**TL,DR:** F\\* you, I'm taking over with my peeps\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, it didn't go exactly like that but here's a snippet:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzwbr23ro0p61.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=af2e6550a7950f05c3d90bf584e8c86f6b27fc87\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorth mentioning, based on RC's past interviews, he likes to handle things without being in the spotlight.\n\nPerhaps he may have more control sitting on the Board w/ a sh\\*t ton of stake in $GME and telling ppl wtf to do, rather than becoming the CEO himself.\n\nIf he doesn't takeover as CEO, **it doesn't worry me one bit.**\n\nRC may instead bring in someone forward-thinking and capable of taking GME to the next f\\*cking level.\n\n[In his own words](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=17c202905840) about Chewy,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"My biggest risk would have been not taking risk...The risk of **hiring expensive executives even though we weren\u2019t profitable.** These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, **I was not the most popular board member**.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, just my thoughts. Either way, the company's future is looking bullish af and GME will dominate the market in the near future.\n\nTrust the process apes!\n\n# [Neda Pacifico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedap), Senior Vice President of E-Commerce\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sista Neda](https://preview.redd.it/gj6d4f6fp0p61.jpg?width=386&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59e9eca546ae65fc9a8541bcb10bf9d2d07eb907)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, well...looky who we have here. Can y'all guess where this brunette beauty is from?\n\n**Motha-fudgin-CHEWY-baby!**\n\nIn fact, RC initially hired our sis FROM Amazon when he started Chewy!
