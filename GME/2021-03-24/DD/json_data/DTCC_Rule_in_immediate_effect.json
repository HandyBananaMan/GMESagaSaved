Effective immediately.\n\nFor the crayon eaters - The DTCC applied for a ruling that allows them to see positional data whenever they see fit. It was recently approved by the SEC and has came into immediate effect at market close March 24th. The rule will allow the DTCC to request the shorting hedge funds to provide their positional data, so the DTCC can check for fraudulent activity.\n\nThis ruling is one of two rulings, the second being the ruling where they are able to liquidate participants at any time - meaning that they will have to close their positions and cover (this ruling is yet to become federally approved).\n\nThe speculation is that the DTCC will see the fraudulent activity and then liquidate the shorting HFs when they see a confirmation of fraudulent activity - shorting of over 100%.\n\nhttps://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/24/B14811-21R.pdf\n\nhttps://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings",
