Do your part. I did. **Ask SEC for a recount of naked GME shorts**, how citadel is going around margin requirements, etc.

**NOTE:**

**I (xyz) further request you to not restrict GME in any fashion, such as halting. That will further hurt retail investors, and GME from its natural progression that has already been manipulated by naked shorts and market manipulations of Robinhood, Citadel, and the like.**
