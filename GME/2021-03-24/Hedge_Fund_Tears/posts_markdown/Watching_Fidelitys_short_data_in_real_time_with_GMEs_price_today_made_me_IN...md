I was getting frustrated today watching what I thought were paper hands selling, but I flipped on Fidelity's active trader pro and watched their shortable shares in real time with the price. It was insane. They ran through SO many shares, and EVERY TIME they borrowed some, the price dipped, but then IMMEDIATELY rebounded until they borrowed more shares to short. NO ONE IS SELLING, AND EVERYONE IS BUYING THE DIP. All that volume is just scalpers. As soon as the shorts stop, all of us (myself included) bought the dip hard. I bought a ton more once I started watching this. Get fucked, hedgies.
