Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(they are describing what most of you have seen on [Iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/) the % of interest).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike always don't panic guys, this is an emotional response and I've been telling you to use logic.\n\nNow is this common that they address this kind of stuff in a shareholders letter? no this type of disclosure is very rare, as in extremely so. ([as can be seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbtpwa/with_regard_to_the_theyre_just_defining_a_short/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom [page 29 of today's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**\n\nYes, the company retains the option to make an ATM share offering, but they are plainly stating that as it stands right now they don't need to do so to raise capital to meet their plans.\n\nWhy wont they do it ? because they don't need the capital. and as far as I understand these are not STOCKS this refers to BONDS.\n\nOn page 30 you can find this:\n\n*Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.*\n\nso everyone chill\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdor5ce7byo61.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a7048e1e110ffea1820822de5314cba3f4bdc8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8tig9e58byo61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db8f0c74f0a3dc4b00e004e6d19c60f75dc8887\n\n# So why are people saying they missed their annual mark?\n\nGood question young ape, normally at the end of the fiscal year a company makes a \"prospectus\" of what will be going on in the next year. meaning in simple words they \"guess\" how much the company will make in the next year.\n\nBut if you take into account that this was made pre covid, and pre knowing most of their stores would need to be closed they still did very well in my book.\n\nThey started to turn around the company mid pandemic, us apes started buying a lot at GME in February and still going strong, so the Q1 Earnings are going to be lit.\n\nBUT WHY DID THE STOCK GO DOWN?\n\nRelax my chimpy bro, a lot of people called that this would happen regardless of how the earnings would come out, because it all depends on how you look at the report, and well we by now have learned that the media sure as hell has an agenda.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snaw8zrx5yo61.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db664d59a8adbbc0fc021c4861e2998bd284b9f6\n\n# So... this all doesn't sound great why are you still bullish?\n\nNormally speaking when an earnings report they move the date as close to the weekend as they can, but for some reason they moved it up, moving it earlier in the week. and it was a meh report.\n\nIt wasn't great it wasn't bad. so why did they move it up?\n\nBecause I think we will see some surprise announcements.\n\nWhy do I think that? easy\n\nAnyone who had listened in yesterday must have noticed how George Sherman fumbled about, he just read the earnings report and overlooking a lot of important stuff, had zero motivation and felt like he was reading his bad report card with zero interest.\n\nHe overlooked to say how the board is refreshing, how the company is planning on changing (important to mention when you bring out a meh report don't you think?), the expenses reduction.\n\nit feels like the current CEO may be out soon. this is pure speculation on my part but I feel like this guy doesn't have long on the board.\n\nYou know why?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8s7zgnoc9yo61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=37168cad7d8a9be9d5416e975af8b79bf9ecd32f\n\n# The board of directors.\n\nlets take a look at the 10k filing again because a lot of people focused on the shares part but forgot about the other things in there of worth.\n\nupcoming changes to who will stand for reelection to the board in June:\n\n>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the \u201c2021 Annual Meeting\u201d), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim\u00e9, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.\n\n**This change would leave only George Sherman and Kurt Wolf remaining from who was on the board prior to the deal with RC Ventures.**\n\nThat's like... nearly the entire of board directors.

Through a committee of directors, our Board is\n    currently evaluating our executive leadership team skill sets related to \n    meeting changing business requirements and has engaged a third party firm \n    to assist in its evaluation and exploration. \n    This evaluation and exploration could result in a change in one or more of \n    our senior executives. \n    \n    Turnover in key leadership positions within the Company could adversely \n    affect our ability to manage the Company efficiently and effectively, \n    could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to \n    additional departures of current personnel, any of which could have a \n    material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n    \n    Our success also depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, motivate \n    and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, management for our stores \n    and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel.\n     \n    In addition, the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, \n    and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store associates. \n    Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified\n    associates include associate morale, our reputation, unemployment rates,\n    competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate \n    compensation packages. \n    \n    Any turnover in senior management in the future or inability to attract \n    and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on \n    our business and results of operations. \n\nIn other words, an outsider will evaluate if the current \"senior management\" is fit for the task at hand.",
