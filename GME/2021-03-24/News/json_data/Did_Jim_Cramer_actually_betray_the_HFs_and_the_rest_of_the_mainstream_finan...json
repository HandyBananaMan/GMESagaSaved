    "selftext": "So today Jim Cramer, who has been very vocally against GME up until now, did a 180 turn on CNBC and said shorts should \"give up\" before they lose all their money, among other things.   \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc62l6/cramer_actually_made_perfect_sense_for_once_lol/  \n\nAlso, he was talking really positive things about Gamestop and the target price of $175 before they started talking over him forcefully and cut him off.  \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5kpu/lmao_cramer_was_positive_about_gme_on_cnbc_just/  \n\nBased on his track record over years, I can't trust this guy. This **might** be a tactic to pretend he is suddenly on the free market's \"side\" only to change back later and hurt retail. But the other guy talking over him and forcing to change the subject is really suspicious. Maybe **even him** realizes that this is past the point of no return. But still, there's no trusting him.  \n\nIn the end, it doesn't really matter. Because we **are** past the point of no return. The shorts must eventually cover, even if it takes days, weeks, months. Diamond hands. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf4c\n\nThis is not financial advice, just my opinion on the subject.",
