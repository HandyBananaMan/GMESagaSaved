And what I found is:

- The after hour drop was due to a massive [short attack on ETF’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbt72n/so_are_we_just_not_gonna_talk_about_these/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) (again, so surprised wow never seen this tactic before) 

- GME confirms that it don’t need to [sell it’s shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbws2w/further_cancelling_fud_gme_does_not_need_to_sell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) while keep doing his [expansion plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbr9o3/gamestop_gme_plans_to_expand_into_pc_gaming/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

- GME OFFICIAL [SEC FILING](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbrcze/short_squeeze_potential_confirmed_taken_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

- Jeffereis changes GME’s [target price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc1bgu/suits_just_raised_pt_from_15_to_175_its_time_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

I really think that I need to buy more $CUM today, cause my body can’t produce all the amount I need after checking on our sub guys

GET READY APES, NOT FOR THE MOON, BUT FOR A FUCKING SPACE TRIP TO ALFA CENTAURI

Edit: WHO SELLS AT $1MLN IS A PAPER HAND BITCH, LOOK AT THE FUCKING NUMBERS AND DO YOUR OWN DD NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR
