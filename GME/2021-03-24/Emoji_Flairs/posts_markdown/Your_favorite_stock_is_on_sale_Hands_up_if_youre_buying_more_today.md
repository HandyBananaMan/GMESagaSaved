We all saw the hedgies try to stage a â€žQ4 earnings bad, time to sellâ€œ after hours coup.

We saw the short sell warning in the SEC filing.

We saw that they have now resorted to shorting ETFs containing GME.

We saw whales loading up their cannons for 250 and 300 calls.

The only other thing I saw was the opportunity to average my price down.

So raise your ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸ’Ž if youâ€˜re buying more today!
