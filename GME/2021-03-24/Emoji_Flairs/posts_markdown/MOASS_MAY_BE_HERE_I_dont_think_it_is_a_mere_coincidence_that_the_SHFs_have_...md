MOASS may be here! 🚀 🚀 🚀 

The SEC recently required shorts to kick the FTD cans down the road every 30 days (hence last spike was 2/24) and they timed the filing for the new 24-hour margin callable law to land on the OLD 30 day kick “the FTD cans down the road” law’s final 30 day date to start the NEW 24-hour “come to jesus day of reckoning” law that SAME date, the 24th... of March!

Guess what? That’s Wednesday (now after 3:00 AM PDT....TODAY) for my fellow Americans from coast to coast. 

Hint: It is no coincidence that the old law will go out of effect the same day they intend the new law to go into effect!!!

They have apparently been margin called by the DTCC as evident by the numerous snapshots of a 634,000,000 or also seen when it was 630,000,000 volume starting at $182 outstanding showing on the free Think or Swim platform (app) for today 3/24!!!!
