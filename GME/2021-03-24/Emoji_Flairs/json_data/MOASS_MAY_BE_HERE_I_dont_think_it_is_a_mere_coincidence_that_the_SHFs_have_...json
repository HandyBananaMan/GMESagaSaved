That\u2019s Wednesday (now after 3:00 AM PDT....TODAY) for my fellow Americans from coast to coast. \n\nHint: It is no coincidence that the old law will go out of effect the same day they intend the new law to go into effect!!!\n\nThey have apparently been margin called by the DTCC as evident by the numerous snapshots of a 634,000,000 or also seen when it was 630,000,000 volume starting at $182 outstanding showing on the free Think or Swim platform (app) for today 3/24!!!! \n\n[Click here to SEE 634 million shorted shares about to get margin-called](https://imgur.com/gallery/xCfwwPL?s=sms)\n\nSHF: Short hedge fundies\n\nIf and thats a big IF it doesn\u2019t happen, please continue HODLING!!!",
