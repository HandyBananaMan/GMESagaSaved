<p>We all saw the hedgies try to stage a â€žQ4 earnings bad, time to sellâ€œ after hours coup.</p>
<p>We saw the short sell warning in the SEC filing.</p>
<p>We saw that they have now resorted to shorting ETFs containing GME.</p>
<p>We saw whales loading up their cannons for 250 and 300 calls.</p>
<p>The only other thing I saw was the opportunity to average my price down.</p>
<p>So raise your ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸ’Ž if youâ€˜re buying more today!</p>
