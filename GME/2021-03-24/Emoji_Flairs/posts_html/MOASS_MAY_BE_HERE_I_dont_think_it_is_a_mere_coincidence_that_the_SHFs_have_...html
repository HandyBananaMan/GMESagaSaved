<p>MOASS may be here! 🚀 🚀 🚀 </p>
<p>The SEC recently required shorts to kick the FTD cans down the road every 30 days (hence last spike was 2/24) and they timed the filing for the new 24-hour margin callable law to land on the OLD 30 day kick “the FTD cans down the road” law’s final 30 day date to start the NEW 24-hour “come to jesus day of reckoning” law that SAME date, the 24th... of March!</p>
<p>Guess what? That’s Wednesday (now after 3:00 AM PDT....TODAY) for my fellow Americans from coast to coast. </p>
<p>Hint: It is no coincidence that the old law will go out of effect the same day they intend the new law to go into effect!!!</p>
<p>They have apparently been margin called by the DTCC as evident by the numerous snapshots of a 634,000,000 or also seen when it was 630,000,000 volume starting at $182 outstanding showing on the free Think or Swim platform (app) for today 3/24!!!! </p>
