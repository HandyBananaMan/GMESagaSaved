<p>Oh BOY, was I ever wrong on how today was going to play out. I’ll make three promises to you apes reading my posts here and now. One, I’ll never lie to you. Two, when I’m wrong, I’ll be the first to admit it. Three, if you ask me a question and I don’t know the answer, I’ll tell you so.</p>
<p>Well, I was wrong and wrong in a big way about today.</p>
<p>I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life; I mean A LOT. I’m twice divorced. That makes me a two-time loser at the ‘marriage game’. The second marriage I cannot even call a mistake because I have my two absolutely wonderful boys out of that ‘mistake’. I’ve been to jail multiple times. I’m even an ex-felon. It was later reduced to a misdemeanor and then eventually expunged from my record. I screw up so much it’s a wonder I am even still alive at this point. But I press on despite myself and the shittiness of the ‘system’.</p>
<p>From the beginning, this was my basic premise.</p>
<ol>
<li>That the long whales (LWs) exist</li>
<li>That they’re greedy little piggies</li>
<li>That they want to make the most money possible on GME short squeeze</li>
<li>That they want plausible deniability when they do it to cover their asses.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. That’s the basis of my thesis. Then I started trying to work out in my head how they go about doing it.</p>
<p>And then I proposed some ways in which the LWs might go about doing those four things. And then I continued to refine that proposal to fit in with the new data that becomes available.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the ‘proposal’ hypothetically from two different perspectives. </p>
<p><strong>POSITIVE HYPOTHETICAL OUTCOME</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say almost everything in my proposal comes to fruition. Does that mean I was right? No, just because I got my expected outcome doesn’t mean I got there for the reasons I laid out. There could be other variable at play, hell it could have been just pure luck.</p>
<p><strong>NEGATIVE HYPOTHETICAL OUTCOME</strong></p>
<p>Now let’s say none of my proposal ends up happening. Does that mean I was wrong? No, again there could be other variables, factors at play preventing it from happening. Hell, the system could be broken (or fraudulent). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I watched The Big Short again last night. There’s the scene where Christian Bale (as Michael Burry) is leaving his office late and there’s only one other employee there. He asks the employee to liquidate some other assets so they can make their margin call. The employee is worried about the state of the firm (and his job). Christian Bale is filled with fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). He’s such a great actor. He knows he’s right but cannot understand why the price keeps going up. He finally states that maybe they are operating within an entirely fraudulent system. The employee counters with [paraphrasing], “Or maybe, you’re just wrong.” Of course, Bale/Burry, being the extremely logical person that he is, has to concede this point. He absolutely could be wrong. But he knows in his gut he that he is not.</p>
<p>Like I said above, I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life. Buying into GME isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>So, I took my thesis from above and came up with my proposal.</p>
<ol>
<li>The LWs will initiate a gamma squeeze</li>
<li>They would use the gamma squeeze to trigger a margin call on the shorting hedge funds (SHFs)</li>
<li>Having the margin call on the SHFs would trigger the mother of all squeezes (MOASS)</li>
<li>They would use out of the money (OTM) zero days to expire (0DTE) call options to make the most money</li>
<li>0DTE OTM call options are the cheapest on Fridays</li>
<li>To buy 0DTE options contracts on a Friday, the previous day needs to close near the opening price</li>
<li>The LWs would ensure the Thursday closing price is near its opening price</li>
<li>The LWs would trigger the gamma squeeze on a Friday for maximum profit</li>
<li>The LWs will try to trigger the short sale restriction (SSR) on Thursday to make it harder for the SHFs to attack the price via shorting</li>
<li>LWs profit</li>
</ol>
<p>If I had left it with that, I wouldn’t need to be apologizing to you all today, eating crow. But maybe through my own hubris, I got out over my skis. I tried to put myself into the mind of the LWs and see what price points made the most sense for them on any given day. And so, I started trying to predict the price on any given day. And every day I was ‘right’, my confidence grew that I was inside their head. Remember, I said I could be ‘right’, but be right for the wrong reasons. And it is complete arrogance on my part for me think I even have one iota of an idea of what it like to be a long whale. These people play with billions sometimes trillions of dollars. I’m happy when I have a few thousand dollars of liquidity. So, for all of that I am sorry dear reader.</p>
<p>Let’s go back and look at my thesis above (items 1-4) and my proposal for how to accomplish it (items 1-10). I believe that maybe item 4 of my thesis may not be true. I think it may not be true for one of two reasons. </p>
<p>The first being my second most hated excuse used by people for why they did shitty things, “Well that’s what they were doing” or, “They were doing it too.” Politicians love using this excuse. Doing a shitty thing because someone else is doing a shitty thing doesn’t make it right, it just means you’re weak minded and selfish.</p>
<p>By the way, my number one and number three most hated excuses for why someone did a shitty thing are “Well that’s the way it’s always been done” and any form of ‘whataboutism’.</p>
<p>The second reason that the LWs may not care about plausible deniability is they know they can get away with it. They know the SEC is impotent (I know we apes all believe this to be true). So maybe, they just don’t care because they know the SEC will do nothing and Congress will just bluster. Maybe it’s a combination of both, “Hey, the SHFs were manipulating the market too, so were the retail investors (RIs), whaddaya gonna do about it?”</p>
<p>Now let’s look at my proposal. This mistake I made here is so f-ing huge I want to continually punch myself in the face. Item 4 of my proposal is so, so wrong. And I was so blinded by the brilliance of this idea that I missed the correct answer. Sometimes we have blinders on and can’t see or just completely miss other pieces of information or signs.</p>
<p>I have big blinders on when it comes to the rest of the market. Some redditors will ask me about a particular movie theater chain’s stock. I will always reply, “I am only following GME so I have no idea about it.” This GME ‘game’ isn’t happening within a vacuum. There is other stuff going on. The SHFs and LWs have many, many positions in other securities. I’m so focused on GME, I’m not seeing the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I believe item 4 will indeed make the LWs lots of money with some crazy, crazy daily returns. But where I was wrong was the this will not make them the MOST money. At least not within my proposal.</p>
<p>If the LWs buy up all the OTM 0DTE call options on a Friday and then trigger the gamma squeeze, sure they’ll make boatload of money that day. And sure, they’ll make even more money with the actual long position they have with GME when the MOASS happens (most likely the following week). But they’d be leaving WAY, WAY more ‘money on the table’. Once again, the answer is options. If they’re holding tons of call options expiring the weeks after the MOASS happens, well, they make more money than I could ever dream of. Hell, they make more money than THEY could ever dream of.</p>
<p>Stupid f-ed up thing about this is I’ve personally been doing exactly this. I have my long position in GME but as the price rose, my ‘buying power’ diminished. So, I started looking into options. I figured that the gamma squeeze would happen on a Friday and that the MOASS would probably happen the following week. So, I always made sure I had some call option contracts for the FOLLOWING Friday in case the gamma squeeze kicked off on the coming Friday. This way, I’d control hundreds of shares when the stock went to the moon. I even came up with a name for these options. I call them my backstop options. They’re there to make sure I can really capitalize on when the price explodes. As a new week started, I would try to buy some options expiring the following Friday for as cheaply as possible and I’d try to sell the options I had expiring for the coming Friday. If I couldn’t get a good enough price, I’d just hang on to them in case the stock got gamma squeezed. And if it didn’t or I sold them to exit the position, I’d just eat the loss. I don’t have deep pockets so I just keep ‘rolling my backstop’ back a week with every new week.</p>
<p>So how do the LWs make the most money with call options contracts that expire weeks from the gamma squeeze? By letting the price tank really, really hard before the gamma squeeze. They can then buy up as many of the OTM options contracts on the cheap. In fact, today, I bought call contracts that expire on April 9th, that’s more than two weeks out. I bought these when the stock was trading in the $140s. I got these for cheaper price (more than two weeks out)  than I did for the call contracts I bought last Monday that expire this Friday with a MUCH HIGHER strike price. The ones last Monday I paid more than double what I paid for the contracts today.  And I could have gotten them cheaper had I waited until the end of the day.</p>
<p>So, let’s revise my two lists.</p>
<p><strong>LW End Game Thesis</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>That the long whales (LWs) exist</li>
<li>That they’re greedy little piggies</li>
<li>That they want to make the most money possible on GME squeeze</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>LW Strategy to Accomplish Their End Game</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The LWs will initiate a gamma squeeze</li>
<li>They would use the gamma squeeze to trigger a margin call on the shorting hedge funds (SHFs)</li>
<li>Having the margin call on the SHFs would trigger the mother of all squeezes (MOASS)</li>
<li>They would use out of the money (OTM) zero days to expire (0DTE) call options to make more money</li>
<li>0DTE OTM call options are the cheapest on Fridays</li>
<li>To buy 0DTE options contracts on a Friday, the previous day needs to close near the opening price</li>
<li>The LWs would ensure the Thursday closing price is near its opening price</li>
<li>The LWs would trigger the gamma squeeze on a Friday for maximum profit</li>
<li>The LWs will try to trigger the short sale restriction (SSR) on Thursday to make it harder for the SHFs to attack the price via shorting</li>
<li>The LWs will use far expiring call options contracts to make the MOST money.</li>
<li>Drive up the price prior to the gamma squeeze to create a ‘longer’ options chain.</li>
<li>Buying far expiring call options contracts will be cheapest if the stock price is low.</li>
<li>Let the price fall to buy most of the OTM options chain before the gamma squeeze.</li>
<li>LWs profit</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve removed item 4 from the thesis and I’ve modified item 4 in the strategy. I also added new items 10 through 13 and bumped down the old number 10 to 14.</p>
<p>I’ve added 11 but haven’t discussed it because it just occurred to me as I was writing this up. Call options sellers will typically only write call contracts for strike prices a few hundred dollars above the current trading price. These way OTM strike prices are just so unlikely to occur (see the bell curve from my last <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbwj37/thoughts_on_tuesday_20210323/">post</a>) that no one will want to buy them and if they do, they’d be so cheap it wouldn’t be profitable. But as the price of a stock increases, these higher strike prices become more likely and so the call options sellers start writing higher strike price call options. Keeps going up, higher call options get created. This is key. Just look at all the now OTM call options there are for the next three weeks. Also look at how cheap they are because of the drop in price today. </p>
<p>This week’s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1616716800&amp;p=GME">options chain</a></p>
<p>Next week’s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1617235200&amp;p=GME">options chain</a></p>
<p>Week after <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1617926400&amp;p=GME">options chain</a></p>
<p>So maybe this is the LWs’ strategy. Again, I’m no longer pretending that I am a LW and that I know how they think. This is what I WOULD DO if I was in their shoes with the limited information I currently have about the situation. What if I said my prediction of $230 - $240 was maybe ‘right’ but off by 100 bucks? My premise was that they would use the earnings call to drive the price back up to that level and then buy all the 0DTE contracts on Friday above the $250 mark. Well, I’ve thrown out thesis item 4, modified strategy item 4 and added items 10-13. Without thesis item 4 holding them back, they make the most money with this new revised strategy. Just go look at those juicy options chains again. Yummy, yummy, money.</p>
<p>But you’re just moving the goal posts, I hear you say. Well yeah, I guess you could say that. I guess I kind of am.</p>
<p>But here’s how I prefer to look at it. I am a scientist and every day I come up with a hypothesis for the experiment I’m about to conduct. The experiment is conducted (that day’s pre-trading, market trading, post-hours trading) and I look at the results (the outcome of the trading, trends, etc., one-time events like earnings calls, plus all the DD gathered by the apes). I then look at the results/data from the experiment and see if it fits my hypothesis. If it does, can I learn anything from this new data. If the data doesn't follow my hypothesis, can I learn anything from the differing outcome. Did I get something wrong; did I miss something; did I not account for some unknown variable? Either way, good or bad, I revise my hypothesis for the next day’s ‘experiment’. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>So that’s it, my revised LW End Game Thesis and Strategy to Accomplish It.</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean it will occur. Just what I would do if I were them. The LWs may even no longer be in the ‘driver’s seat’. I’ll get to this in a bit.</p>
<p>Ok, so on to today’s goings on.</p>
<p>I see seven ways forward from our current situation with GME (if y’all think of any more please leave them in the comments, or DM me, I’m more likely to see a DM).</p>
<ol>
<li>The SHFs have already covered their shorts and eventually GME returns to normal.</li>
<li>The SHFs somehow cover their short positions and GME returns to normal.</li>
<li>The SHFs somehow bankrupt GameStop and the SHFs win.</li>
<li>The system is fraudulent and will take some ‘external’ factor to resolve it.</li>
<li>The LWs exist and will use a strategy similar to what I’ve laid out.</li>
<li>RIs are able to initiate the short squeeze.</li>
<li>Some other catalyst triggers the short squeeze.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, so let’s take them in order. </p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong></p>
<p>I think we’ve seen enough evidence that this isn’t the case. So, I think the likelihood of this occurring is very low.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong></p>
<p>I don’t see how this is possible without the apes selling and we know apes don’t sell. Not a likely scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong></p>
<p>No way this is happening within the next year, probably no chance within the next 3 years. Less than 1% chance of occurring.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 4</strong></p>
<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. What is the biggest driver in the movement of a stock price within a given day? VOLUME. But how do you drive the price higher with volume if no one is selling their real shares and the only shares you can buy are the ones the SHFs are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbu916/not_my_post_but_it_is_being_downvoted_like_crazy/">counterfeiting</a>? In this scenario, the price may be ‘stuck’ from going up and will continue to go down due to the synthetic shares continuing to be created and sold. If we’re indeed in this scenario I see only a few ways out. The SHFs could be doing what u/GMEJesus <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbu916/not_my_post_but_it_is_being_downvoted_like_crazy/gs0jsy0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">describes</a> in his comment on that post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. They lost and now their only play is to make this a devil's bargain [with] the SEC. They keep making the scenario so that the entire market and economy tanks [if] this plays out. They are looking the SEC and all of us right in the eye as they shoot the bottom of the boat full of holes that we're all in. They don't care. If they're going down, they are taking everyone with them. That is their play right now. FUCK them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oof, I really don’t like this ending to scenario 4. If this happens, I’m not only sharpening my pitchforks, I’m sharpening my machete too. This ending would continue to see the GME price drop until hopefully the SEC, Congress, the DTCC, or somebody would step in and say enough is enough, you’re about to decimate the entire economy. Because if the SHFs take this route and continue to create synthetic shares and short them, they could go well passed 1000% of the float.  And all of those shares would need to be covered eventually. But hey, these guys are used to be bailed out for their risky behavior.</p>
<p>The other two ways out of this scenario I see, are if GameStop does a stock recall. Or the new DTCC rules finally take effect and the DTCC gets a real look at what’s going on and margin calls the SHFs. Both of these endings to scenario 4 should trigger a short squeeze. Whether the government steps in is to be determined.</p>
<p>Are we in scenario 4? God, I sure hope not. Likelihood?  I mean, it’s certainly plausible. I don’t want to put a percentage on it. But I think it’s more likely than the first 3 scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 5</strong></p>
<p>This is the scenario I’ve been laying out for the past two weeks. I’m a little biased with this one. I think as long as we’re not in scenario 4, then this one is still pretty plausible. Again though, I’m definitely biased, so take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 6</strong></p>
<p>I think today showed that the apes really can’t drive up the price. I assume many of you were ‘buying the dip’ and it just kept dropping. I thought for sure it was going to take off after the bell and I bought more at $160. I wished I’d waited until the end of the day (my timing with GME has been so horrible, but I’ve bought and held). I think most of the apes are pretty tapped out when it comes to their liquidity, I know I’m damn close to being tapped out. I think most of the apes have dumped in the all the extra the money they had already. Sure, they may buy more after every paycheck but it just isn’t enough to move the needle.</p>
<p>The only way I see RI being able to trigger the squeeze is by having some catalyst start creating upward pressure, the media actually covering this, and all the non-ape RIs FOMOing again and buying. Well, we’ve seen that the media isn’t covering the positive GME news so this scenario is unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 7</strong></p>
<p>Ryan Cohen being named CEO, GameStop splitting the stock, GameStop recalling the shares, the DTCC rules going into effect and margin calling the SHFs, etc. As long as we’re not in scenario 4, any of these events could trigger the short squeeze (either ‘naturally’ or with the help of a gamma squeeze). So, this scenario is certainly plausible.</p>
<p>Let me know if you think I’ve missed any.</p>
<p>We get paid in scenarios 5-7 and probably scenario 4. The question will be how much. I don’t think the first three scenarios are likely at all.</p>
<p>I’m not presenting this to spread FUD. But I think it’s good to know what the possible outcomes are and plan accordingly.</p>
<h1>Other Stuff from Today</h1>
<p>A DM conversation I had today with u/the-bevilacqua-kid questioning if GME will issue more stock diluting our shares. I really believe this is highly unlikely.  I have permission to share this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Ignore the Typos" src="https://preview.redd.it/9n1k8wzz13p61.jpg?width=704&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78fcf393993763d1e87cfdca4898b3368490bb8b" /></p>
<p>Redditor u/liloozykert shared this post with me from u/GoldenSheriff. Something to lift your spirits.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Look, when you buy a stock, you actually own a piece of a company. That piece has value. It can be undervalued, overvalued, or valued just right. Either way IT HAS VALUE. The stock price can go up from where you bought it and it can go down from where you bought it. You don’t have any gains or any losses until you sell it. UNTIL YOU SELL IT. The only way you lose your entire investment is if the company goes bankrupt. GameStop is not going bankrupt any time soon. So, all you have to do is hold. It doesn’t cost you anything. </p>
<p>The SHFs however are betting against the stock by shorting. This costs them lots of money every day to maintain this position. And they eventually have to cover those shorts, unless GameStop goes out of business. GameStop is not going out of business anytime soon (just stating this again).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, HODL you filthy apes. <strong>The price doesn’t matter.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Personal Note</h1>
<p>I’ve been battling issues with some lung issues for most of the past year. I have these terrible coughing fits that can last up to 30 minutes or more as I try to get out the crap that’s in there (yeah, I know fucking gross). This coughing takes a real toll on me and really fatigues me.</p>
<p>It would have been much easier for me to have stayed in bed and rested tonight rather than write this up. I really didn’t want to get up, but I felt I owed all of you who read my stuff an explanation, so here I sit typing.</p>
<p>The crappy thing about all of this was I started a new contract at the end of February. The people are really great and nice to me. But I constantly have to miss days due to the fatigue and coughing fits. I haven’t worked a full 40 hours week since I started. I’ve only worked two hours this week so far. Sure, I could put in more hours and bill them for it but I wouldn’t feel right doing so if I cannot give them 100%. Remember my two principles that I try to follow. Writing software requires a lot of concentration and I just cannot do it currently.</p>
<p>I work as a contractor so I only get paid if I work, i.e. I have no ‘sick’ days, no vacation days. Not working is costing me money. Don’t worry, I’m not asking you all for money. Just telling you the situation because it further shows how broken the American system is.</p>
<p>Sure, I chose to be a contractor, but for many Americans, more and more companies are trying to force their employees into this model. Just look at Uber. </p>
<p>Why? If you’re an employee, your social security, Medicare, unemployment (federal and state) taxes are withheld from your paycheck. What most people don’t know is that your employer has to match this amount. If you have a lot of employees, this is a huge expense. Then if your employer offers you things like healthcare, 401K matching, dental, vision, pension, sick days, vacation days, etc., any type of benefit, they are paying for most of those expenses too. This cuts into their bottom line. If they can turn all their employees into contractors, they don’t have to pay for any of that stuff, including the taxes I mentioned. If you’re motivated by greed and don't give a shit about your employees, then this is what you do.</p>
<p>Oh, and because you’re a contractor and not paying into the unemployment pool, if you lose your contract, you CANNOT collect unemployment.</p>
<p>So, more and more Americans are being forced into this model. Again, I chose this, but for many, they don’t have a choice. Accept it or don’t have a ‘job’.</p>
<p>And as a contractor, I have to buy my own health insurance. But that is a long,long conversation for another day and I am truly tired.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>HOLD FAST!</p>
