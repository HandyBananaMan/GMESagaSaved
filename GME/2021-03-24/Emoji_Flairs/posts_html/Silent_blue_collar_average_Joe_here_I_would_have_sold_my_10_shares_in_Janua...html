<h1>Title: Silent blue collar average Joe here. I would have sold my 10 shares in January for 4k. I've worked overtime, hustled side work, and upped my portfolio to triple digit shares. I HODL for THE MOON now for every one of you. Don't paper hands now, hodl for your fellow ape. We are the silent majority.</h1>
