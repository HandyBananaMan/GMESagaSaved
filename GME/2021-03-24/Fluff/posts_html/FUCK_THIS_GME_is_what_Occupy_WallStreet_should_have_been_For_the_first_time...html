<p>My Ape🐒</p>
<p>I'm so happy you are here! You dont know me, I'm easy_like_squeezy, its awesome to meet you!</p>
<p>Today I got angry, really angry at the hedgefucks and the rest. I got angry not for me but for you. I was sitting and worrying about the price etc because I'm so tired of struggling. I have Major Depressive Disorder, my testosterone is that of a 65 year old, I'm alone, my therapy and pills mean its a choice sometime between that or food etc etc et fucking c. Im tired of denying myself. Im tired of earning little for 16 hr days.</p>
<p><strong>Im so tired of everything HAVING to be so hard</strong> because some fuck in Connecticut cant think beyond himself</p>
<p>And then it hit me and I wanted to weep a little because I thought of how many of you and us feel like that or for whom its hard, too hard.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>SO. Now Im FUCKING pissed!</strong> Im in South Africa the Dollar to Rand is 15:1 ie the tendie gains from is generation changing. Ive been holding from 350 down to 40 and back. I thought about what the tendies could mean for me <strong>BUT FUCK THAT!</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>NOW I HOLD FOR YOU! 💎🐒💎🐒💎</strong>I hold and will be the last one holding even if its the bag because I love you and I will do my best to protect you and change YOUR life</p>
<p>I HAVE DIAMON LOVE 💎❤💎❤💎❤</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>Edit: I have diamond hands to hold you and a diamond heart because you are my brothers</em></p>
<p><em>Edit 2: To those calling me cringe etc and just negativity, please know this: I love you . If your holding GME or not I want the best for you - you are my brother no less.</em></p>
<p><em>To the shills, bots: I hope you see the amount of love and strength here; you didnt stand a chance from the start</em> </p>
