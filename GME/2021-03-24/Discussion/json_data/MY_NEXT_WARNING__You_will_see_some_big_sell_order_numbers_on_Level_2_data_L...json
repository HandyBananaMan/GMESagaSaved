Because they can trade @ 4 decimal points while retail can only trade at 2 decimal points.  \nSo if there are 14 million shares traded today and if they are selling each share among themselves at a loss of $0.0001 cent to drive the price down then it will just cost then $1400 for that manipulation. This is without taking into other buy orders and sell orders. Just an example. So in the short term it can look like they are winning, but reality could be different. If you are in doubt zoom out. \n\nThis is not a financial advise.",

Like 10k @$300 20k @ $350 etc These are fake orders to make you think that there are people who trying to sell 10k shares to try and make you sell before that price. Psychological game. DON'T FALL ! YOU DECIDE YOUR SELL!",
