    "selftext": "I've seen an uptick in the number of posts calling for SEC involvement today on here and WSB, most calling for a share count or similar to take place.\n\nI don't believe this is a smart move *at all*. Getting the SEC involved right now has a significant risk of them coming in and shutting down trading completely, if they decided to tally the books. Best case, this will benefit the hedge funds, market makers and DTCC by giving them breathing room to come up with damage-limiting strategies to cover their corruption. Worst case, they might decide forced liquidations of the counterfeit shares at a \"reasonable price is the best course of action, to prevent contagion and ensure stability\" yadda yadda yadda. I can hear the soundbites already.\n\nThe SEC has known full-well for years what's been going on and never moved. Ask yourself whose side they're really on.\n\nWrite to the SEC after the squeeze or the minute there is more manipulation - if that happens again, make their ears bleed. But not before.\n\nMy 2 cents of non-financial advice.\n\nEdit: Some people really want to take action. In that case writing your rep/senators/the NASAA might be a good idea - they are the ones who can change laws and that's what's needed.",
