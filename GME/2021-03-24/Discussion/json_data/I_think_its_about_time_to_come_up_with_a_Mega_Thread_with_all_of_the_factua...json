    "selftext": "Being able to have a database of illegal activity that can be presented quickly and easily to a Congressional Rep IMO needs to happen. So they can't say they never saw all the evidence and can be held accountable. I'm newer to Reddit so I don't know how to make it happen but, i think we should consider it. So every GME owner can send an email out to them with a link on the illegal activity that is happening. It can't just stay interspersed on Reddit it has to be consolidated and easily digestible so the facts can be seen and presented correctly. I am tired of seeing all of these things happening before my eyes and not seeing any real accountability. Relying on a Rep to just know without sending them what you witness is fool hardy and won't end well because your voice has not been heard.\n\n\nP.S.  I'm HODLing my tendies til Kenny G from Connecticut has to become a butt slut because he's so broke his ass is the only thing he can sell. Love you all for the great info and the inspiration! Rocket Emoji and shit.\n\nEdit: All you shills down voting this when it can actually help GME can suck a fart out of my ass.",
