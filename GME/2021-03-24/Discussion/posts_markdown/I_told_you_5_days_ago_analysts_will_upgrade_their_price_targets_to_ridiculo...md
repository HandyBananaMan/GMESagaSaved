# Title: I told you 5 days ago analysts will upgrade their price targets to ridiculous prices like $200-300 and expect you to sell when price goes above that. DON'T FALL, YOUR SHARE PRICE IS WHAT YOU SELL IT FOR NOT WHAT THEY SAY. #GME can be $5k, $10k or $100k make sure everyone sees this post.

EDIT: 100k is only an example because there is no such thing called PEAK when it comes to a share price and it's a blackhole made by few ass h#les. If you don't sell they can't buy it's that simple.

Not a financial advise.
