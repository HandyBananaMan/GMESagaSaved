The short squeeze is going to create ~~ripples~~ Tsunamis across the market that might last months or even years.

1. The hedgies have borrowed an extraordinary amount of shares that they now have to buy back.
2. The hedgies will not have the money to buy back the shares
3. The hedgies will liquidate all their other positions
4. The hedgies will short any other stock they dont have positions in order to get some fast cash!
5. Now all the market is down while GME is being covered!
6. People will start buying the discounted stocks included the ones from step 4.
7. ??????

Î™ have one and only fear, that the squeeze will start before the end of month, before I get my paycheck...
