#Title: Not only have we exposed market manipulation, illegal HF tactics, dark pools, payment for order flow, contract for difference, synthetic shorting, for the cruelty that it is, we are also changing the market for the better and making the world a better place. Save the market post squeeze.

We have the power and the tendies to help the world's markets stabilise once the squeeze has squozen. Reinvest post squeeze. Find good ethical companies you like and help them through a rough time.

Pay your taxes.

Not only have we brought the world's attention upon the injustices in modern markets, we can help fix them and save them.

We have done more for the financial system in 3 months than any protest in history (and no one got hurt along the way).

This is madness you say?
