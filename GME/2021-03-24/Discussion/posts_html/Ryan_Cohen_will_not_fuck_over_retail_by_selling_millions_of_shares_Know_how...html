<p>RC knows if they make moves that help retail out, GameStop will be rewarded handsomely. They’ll have a legion of loyal and at that point affluent customers and investors. Win win. Alternatively he can choose to fuck us over and then it’s lose lose. He is not stupid and he’s also a millennial not a boomer. He knows which generation is primarily holding on to the stock. The one that only has 4% of the wealth in this country because the Boomer smegals saw to that.</p>
