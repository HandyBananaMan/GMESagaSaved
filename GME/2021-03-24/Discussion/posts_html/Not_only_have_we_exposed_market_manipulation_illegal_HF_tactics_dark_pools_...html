<p>We have the power and the tendies to help the world's markets stabilise once the squeeze has squozen. Reinvest post squeeze. Find good ethical companies you like and help them through a rough time.</p>
<p>Pay your taxes.</p>
<p>Not only have we brought the world's attention upon the injustices in modern markets, we can help fix them and save them.</p>
<p>We have done more for the financial system in 3 months than any protest in history (and no one got hurt along the way).</p>
<p>This is madness you say?</p>
