<li>The hedgies have borrowed an extraordinary amount of shares that they now have to buy back.</li>
<li>The hedgies will not have the money to buy back the shares</li>
<li>The hedgies will liquidate all their other positions</li>
<li>The hedgies will short any other stock they dont have positions in order to get some fast cash!</li>
<li>Now all the market is down while GME is being covered!</li>
<li>People will start buying the discounted stocks included the ones from step 4.</li>
