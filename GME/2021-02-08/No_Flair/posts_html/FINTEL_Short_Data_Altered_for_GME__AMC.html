<p>After reading this post by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/">u/RubinoffButtChug69</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lflhz4/fintel_altered_short_volume_data_for_gme/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lflhz4/fintel_altered_short_volume_data_for_gme/</a></p>
<p>I sent an email to FINTEL asking why the Short data had been altered by 50% for GME &amp; AMC for the past 10 trading days.</p>
<p>This was the response:</p>
<p><img alt="Response #1" src="https://preview.redd.it/5o5ek0bopcg61.jpg?width=1262&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd26504acbe7b12be1556908f237f23266fc419" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I then sent a followup email:</p>
<p><img alt="E-Mail #2" src="https://preview.redd.it/9mdgo102ocg61.jpg?width=1264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92e3637f6c4c6ab6ec57aa272c951298e60a05df" /></p>
<p>This is the response:</p>
<p><img alt="Response #2" src="https://preview.redd.it/xl1a2gsbocg61.jpg?width=1264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be6e72e78b04c8c1f84b0310751904b0dc2791b7" /></p>
<p>Seriously?!? The reporting agency for the largest financial trading system in the world made a boo-boo which goes back an entire fucking year!?!? (2020 really was shit, wasn't it?)</p>
<p>If the programming error existed for 72 hours from Friday to Saturday, why was data for the past 10 trading days (and, mebbe, the whole year) impacted?</p>
<p>This is the organization that is responsible for reporting ACCURATE data that BILLION dollar decisions are based on. They are either lying or incompetent.</p>
<p>SEC I know you are watching us on here. WTF is going on?!?</p>

<p>In response to the above, I sent this email on Feb 9:</p>
<p><img alt="E-mail #3" src="https://preview.redd.it/eo6ww5gxssh61.jpg?width=1268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f59f8221c638e3b867a053410559d256f1b15378" /></p>
<p>Finally, even though I received my other responses within a matter of hours, this is the response I received on Feb 15:</p>
<p><img alt="Response #3" src="https://preview.redd.it/warsdrfttsh61.jpg?width=1271&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c5cd1effb216197cc9bc2731e5d1140bfe2d97f" /></p>
<p>As you can see, none of the questions were addressed. The response was completely blank. They had simply changed the status of my inquiry to "Resolved". I clicked on the "View Request" link and, through the FINTEL site, asked them to respond to the questions. I received the following at 10:39 pm on Feb 15:</p>
<p><img alt="Response #4" src="https://preview.redd.it/dgimv36atsh61.jpg?width=1266&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1c7d1db61dba4308f65685509d52d0f3e22f248" /></p>
<p>There are several things about this response that I find interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>They claim they responded to my earlier questions "in the spirit of being transparent" yet are now refusing to continue to be transparent and answer any questions.</li>
<li>The openly admit that they are fully aware of the posting activity here on /GME. This begs the question: Why? Why on earth would FINTEL be concerned about a bunch of delusional GameStop bagholders spouting conspiracy theories about intentionally altered short data and manipulated stock markets? Unless....</li>
<li>They claim they will not be taking anymore time from "legitimate tickets" thus implying that my questions are illegitimate. I can't help but wonder if they would say the same thing to Congress?</li>
<li>Wilton Risenhoover (the founder of FINTEL) was the responder to my first two emails. These responses come from an "Aqua R". I am not sure who he is, perhaps a lawyer? Again, I can't help but wonder why my old buddy Wilton didn't answer. </li>
<li>Aqua R refers to Mr. Risenhoover as "The Founder". This just made me laugh. "The Founder"? And they say <strong><em>we</em></strong> are like a cult!</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I plan to resubmit my questions and point out that I still do need help with "actual use of [their] site". After all they claim to offer "Institutional Grade Research Tools" to help you "Dominate the Financial Markets" with "more accurate data" for "better decisions". Yet, I am still not sure what numbers I can rely on. They discovered a "programming error". What if there are other errors in the data that have yet to be discovered? I probably won't get a response since they seem to be circling the wagons, but I can try.</p>
<p>Any ideas for additional questions are welcome. Or, please feel free to send them questions of your own. They can be reached at <a href="mailto:support@fintelio.atlassian.net">support@fintelio.atlassian.net</a>. </p>
