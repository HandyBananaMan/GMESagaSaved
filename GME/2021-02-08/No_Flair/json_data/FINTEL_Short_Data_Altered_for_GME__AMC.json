JUST SPREAD THE WORD!\n\nAfter reading this post by [u/RubinoffButtChug69](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lflhz4/fintel\\_altered\\_short\\_volume\\_data\\_for\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lflhz4/fintel_altered_short_volume_data_for_gme/)\n\nI sent an email to FINTEL asking why the Short data had been altered by 50% for GME & AMC for the past 10 trading days.\n\nThis was the response:\n\n[Response #1](https://preview.redd.it/5o5ek0bopcg61.jpg?width=1262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8dd26504acbe7b12be1556908f237f23266fc419)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI then sent a followup email:\n\n[E-Mail #2](https://preview.redd.it/9mdgo102ocg61.jpg?width=1264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92e3637f6c4c6ab6ec57aa272c951298e60a05df)\n\nThis is the response:\n\n[Response #2](https://preview.redd.it/xl1a2gsbocg61.jpg?width=1264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be6e72e78b04c8c1f84b0310751904b0dc2791b7)\n\nSeriously?!? The reporting agency for the largest financial trading system in the world made a boo-boo which goes back an entire fucking year!?!? (2020 really was shit, wasn't it?)\n\nIf the programming error existed for 72 hours from Friday to Saturday, why was data for the past 10 trading days (and, mebbe, the whole year) impacted?\n\nThis is the organization that is responsible for reporting ACCURATE data that BILLION dollar decisions are based on. They are either lying or incompetent.\n\nSEC I know you are watching us on here. WTF is going on?!?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEDIT: 2/9/2021 10:26 EST\n\nSome more info: [https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lg29co/extensive\\_dd\\_into\\_fintel\\_short\\_volume\\_alterations/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lg29co/extensive_dd_into_fintel_short_volume_alterations/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nFYI - This was posted to WSB and was removed in less than 15 minutes.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEDIT: 2/16/2021 03:12 EST\n\nIn response to the above, I sent this email on Feb 9:\n\n[E-mail #3](https://preview.redd.it/eo6ww5gxssh61.jpg?width=1268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f59f8221c638e3b867a053410559d256f1b15378)\n\nFinally, even though I received my other responses within a matter of hours, this is the response I received on Feb 15:\n\n[Response #3](https://preview.redd.it/warsdrfttsh61.jpg?width=1271&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c5cd1effb216197cc9bc2731e5d1140bfe2d97f)\n\nAs you can see, none of the questions were addressed. The response was completely blank. They had simply changed the status of my inquiry to \"Resolved\". I clicked on the \"View Request\" link and, through the FINTEL site, asked them to respond to the questions. I received the following at 10:39 pm on Feb 15:\n\n[Response #4](https://preview.redd.it/dgimv36atsh61.jpg?width=1266&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1c7d1db61dba4308f65685509d52d0f3e22f248)\n\nThere are several things about this response that I find interesting:\n\n1. They claim they responded to my earlier questions \"in the spirit of being transparent\" yet are now refusing to continue to be transparent and answer any questions.\n2. The openly admit that they are fully aware of the posting activity here on /GME. This begs the question: Why? Why on earth would FINTEL be concerned about a bunch of delusional GameStop bagholders spouting conspiracy theories about intentionally altered short data and manipulated stock markets? Unless....\n3. They claim they will not be taking anymore time from \"legitimate tickets\" thus implying that my questions are illegitimate. I can't help but wonder if they would say the same thing to Congress?\n4. Wilton Risenhoover (the founder of FINTEL) was the responder to my first two emails. These responses come from an \"Aqua R\". I am not sure who he is, perhaps a lawyer? Again, I can't help but wonder why my old buddy Wilton didn't answer. \n5. Aqua R refers to Mr. Risenhoover as \"The Founder\". This just made me laugh. \"The Founder\"? And they say ***we*** are like a cult!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI plan to resubmit my questions and point out that I still do need help with \"actual use of \\[their\\] site\". After all they claim to offer \"Institutional Grade Research Tools\" to help you \"Dominate the Financial Markets\" with \"more accurate data\" for \"better decisions\". Yet, I am still not sure what numbers I can rely on. They discovered a \"programming error\". What if there are other errors in the data that have yet to be discovered? I probably won't get a response since they seem to be circling the wagons, but I can try.\n\nAny ideas for additional questions are welcome. Or, please feel free to send them questions of your own.
