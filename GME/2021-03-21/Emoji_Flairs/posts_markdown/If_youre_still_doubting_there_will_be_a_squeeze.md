Then ask youself:  


Why would big brokers such a Robinhood halt buying on a stock that was skyrocketing but not selling?

a normal circuit breaker wouldn't stop selling too?

Why would the price go down to 40 even if there was no sell volume (dark pools)? 

Why did some journalists write articles about GME flops days BEFORE reports come out?

Why did some parts of important and official conferences get edited out?

Why are there bots downvoting all positive messages and DD posts?

The BS and manipulation we saw in those past weeks was so much i might even have forgotten to add some other HF tricks in this list.

Just relax.

Take a break, put your phone down. 

It might take a while, who knows.

Set price alarm to 1k (not TP, of course) 

Maybe even start thinking of a color for your lambo, but don't let anxiety and impatience ruin your weekend!

Remember it's a matter of "when", not "if"

Hold strong
