<p>Then ask youself:  </p>
<p>Why would big brokers such a Robinhood halt buying on a stock that was skyrocketing but not selling?</p>
<p>a normal circuit breaker wouldn't stop selling too?</p>
<p>Why would the price go down to 40 even if there was no sell volume (dark pools)? </p>
<p>Why did some journalists write articles about GME flops days BEFORE reports come out?</p>
<p>Why did some parts of important and official conferences get edited out?</p>
<p>Why are there bots downvoting all positive messages and DD posts?</p>
<p>The BS and manipulation we saw in those past weeks was so much i might even have forgotten to add some other HF tricks in this list.</p>
<p>Just relax.</p>
<p>Take a break, put your phone down. </p>
<p>It might take a while, who knows.</p>
<p>Set price alarm to 1k (not TP, of course) </p>
<p>Maybe even start thinking of a color for your lambo, but don't let anxiety and impatience ruin your weekend!</p>
<p>Remember it's a matter of "when", not "if"</p>
<p>Hold strong</p>
