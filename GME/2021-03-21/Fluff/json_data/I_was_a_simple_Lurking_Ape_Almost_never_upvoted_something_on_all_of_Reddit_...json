Ape stronk together \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd8d\n\nEDIT 4: so we\u2019ve hit /r/all. Obviously there is some negative sentiment coming from there. Just wanted to say: of course you\u2019re allowed to disagree and think this is just stupid hype. But I\u2019d really recommend you read some of the megathread DD before. Maybe you\u2019ll read something that can or will be of value to you.\n\nEDIT 5: is this extremely cringy? I totally understand if it feels that way being an outsider. But honestly, I\u2019ve never seen a community so united. We\u2019re just people having fun with a common goal, and a lot of smart things get said along the way.\n\nEDIT 6: how THE FUCK did this become a top 10 post on this sub all time.",
