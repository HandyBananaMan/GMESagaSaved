# Title: I was a simple Lurking Ape. Almost never upvoted something on all of Reddit. Neither on r/GME. That time has ended. From now on I upvote every fucking positive word or DD there is about GME, and so should you. 💎👋🚀

r/all you have no idea what’s coming for you.

EDIT: if you consider this to be financial advice you’re fucking stupid, go cry to your boss about it 👋

EDIT 2: It’s Europoor Mornin’ time (10:48 CEST), so Shitadel Interns are 💤 💤  right now and this post is still at 100% upvotes? 
Lmao this shit’s crazy 💥

EDIT 3: never thought I’d see my own post at the top of the subreddit for a moment. Ape stronk together 🥰🦍

EDIT 4: so we’ve hit /r/all. Obviously there is some negative sentiment coming from there. Just wanted to say: of course you’re allowed to disagree and think this is just stupid hype. But I’d really recommend you read some of the megathread DD before. Maybe you’ll read something that can or will be of value to you.

EDIT 5: is this extremely cringy? I totally understand if it feels that way being an outsider. But honestly, I’ve never seen a community so united. We’re just people having fun with a common goal, and a lot of smart things get said along the way.

EDIT 6: how THE FUCK did this become a top 10 post on this sub all time.
