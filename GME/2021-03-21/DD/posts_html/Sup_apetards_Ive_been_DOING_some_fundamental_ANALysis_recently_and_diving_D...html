<p>I have to warn you, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it, I promise you - ape transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading.</p>
<p>My fundamental idea behind this colossal piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using <strong>ELIA</strong>s (<strong>E</strong>explain <strong>L</strong>ike <strong>I</strong>'m an <strong>A</strong>pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen should any major potential catalyst unveil (e.g. earnings next week). So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums. I believe in your mental capabilities apemeisters (though, I know that at this point it is a pure gamble).</p>
<p>And yeah, this a not a financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor. Just and ape with one and a half brain wrinkles.</p>

<p>The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!</p>

<h1>Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: "A <strong>hedge</strong> <strong>fund</strong> is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return." - The <strong>game</strong> is that simple, thanks, Inve <strong>stop</strong> edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>"ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?"</strong></p>
<p>You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be Dug Deeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.</p>
<p><strong>SHORT SELLING ELIA.</strong> You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give it back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? <strong>PROFIT!!!!</strong> (of about 50 bucks)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/short-sellers-lose-usd5-05-billion-in-bet-against-gamestop-5097616">the highest percentage of float shorted in the world</a>, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' (yes, used as an anagram here again) in comments criticizing short process as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. At this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there‚Äôs no one to hold these companies feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a üåàüêª, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only <strong>auti</strong> postulate to live by here, and that is: "STONKS ONLY GO UP".  </p>
<p><strong>"k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?"</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/mddcarby2do61.jpg?width=1902&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55062b46247cc958f8f1dd66cb03a0200a60ccb3</p>
<p>I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first.</p>
<p><strong>IOUs ELIA</strong>. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? üêª with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage clears up after T+2, and  Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system and the IOUs are wiped out.</p>
<p><strong>Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA</strong>. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. This is how the loophole is exploited, generally (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, you will be dealt with later for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!  </p>
<p><strong>"My brraIn hurtz caN i go home PleZ?"</strong></p>
<p>Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication in reading!  </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/z45wnj697eo61.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1f32bf4ea435f7ab3a02cdc597350da2e7a18c">\"Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\" - Wen Moon.</a></p>
<p><strong>"oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!"</strong> - an ape.</p>
<p>That's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonist MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party yesterday and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. Let's take a look at the chart of GME.  </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/nioeif5egeo61.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bba603499f76e15be530304345379043a7edf545">GME Monthly Chart</a></p>
<p>As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the obvious steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've mad shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING SEVERAL FUCKING YEARS? Because of <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/worthless-stocks-tax-deductible-4986.html">the bankruptcy jackpot</a>.</p>
<p>As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who effectively juggle the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a rare occurrence which promises a much larger pay off if successful. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares is returned to the short seller; furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you already won it all (MC reasoning)?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, they decided to YOLO...  </p>

<p>And this is where a shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover...</p>
<p>[Apetards, I found myself working on this post for two days in a row, investing my whole weekend into this beautiful memeful research, and I fucking regret nothing! However, as it is already 00:00 of Mon 22nd in my time zone and there is some work to be done tomorrow and through the working week, I decided to hurry up and intensify the narration finishing this post a little bit faster. Furthermore, I also see it to be necessary to split the story, which initially was intended to be a one bulky post, into several chapters and posts. Apeace!]  </p>

<p>When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle, and this is where you, Mr. 'Trader', started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, and the did it spectacularly. More precisely:  </p>
