<p>Morning Apes! My main stomping ground over on WSBN is still getting bot-bombed at the moment, so I hope you don't mind me sliding in here for a quick post. You'll have to put up with me posting it myself today, instead of it getting copy/pasted, for a change.</p>
<p>-<strong>Part 1: The Shorts</strong>-</p>
<p>https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME</p>
<p>We are currently in a complete market disconnect when dealing with GME short shares.</p>
<p>In this graph, you will see the correlation between the red "FEE" line, and the blue bars showing the "AVAILABLE" shares to borrow. </p>
<p>https://i.imgur.com/tNF8w8t.png</p>
<p>As the bars get smaller, the line gets higher. As the shares get harder to borrow, the fee increases. Simple business acumen.</p>
<p>By why isn't it actually doing that the last few weeks?</p>
<p>I monitor the shorts on various platforms constantly, and on Friday, we saw available to borrow shares on IBD fluctuate in the hundreds for the first time since we pulled-back to $40.</p>
<p>Let me say that again: <strong>Between 2pm and 4pm on Friday 19Mar21, there were less than 1,000 shares available to borrow to short on IBD.</strong></p>
<p>Maximum shares to borrow has not increased on IBD since 3/17/21. On 3/17 there was a total available share count of 600,000. Normally as shares get lent out, the numbers gradually replenish themselves as shares are covered and new shares are located to borrow. </p>
<p>https://i.imgur.com/bpLQ6MD.png</p>
<p>For example on 3/15, the day began with 250,000 available. It dropped to 100,000 at 12:45, before being replenished at 1:30pm back up to 250,000. They ended the day with 150,000 available, and the next day on 3/16, they had replenished to 400,000.</p>
<p>https://i.imgur.com/VlYnbIh.png</p>
<p>Well, 10:00am on 3/17/21 was the last time any shares have been replenished on IBD. The available to borrow share count has <strong>ONLY</strong> gone down since that time, and there has been <strong>ZERO</strong> meaningful replenishment. </p>
<p>They couldn't even find 1,000 actual shares to borrow on Friday.</p>
<p>https://i.imgur.com/rUYtFnF.png</p>
<p>But if shares are so hard to locate right now... why hasn't the borrow fee increased?</p>
<p>That isn't even a rhetorical question... I'm legit asking anyone out there: How does the price to borrow DECREASE on a day when shares aren't able to be found, and after two steady days of not being able to locate new shares to lend?</p>
<p>Who thinks that is a good bet? Who lends such a highly volatile stock as GME, with no shares available to locate, at 0.5%? </p>
<p>Someone is purposely trying to make shorting GME a cheap bet. I think someone just wants to watch the world burn, and they are selling gasoline at 0.5%...</p>
<p>Part 1b:</p>
<p>https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme</p>
<p>And how does IBD only show borrowable shares in the thousands, but Fintel shows the daily short numbers at 6,400,000 shares shorted for a total of 26% of the total daily trading volume?</p>
<p>Yes, I realize that IBD only shows a couple of brokers, that it's updated every 15 minutes, and doesn't show cumulative count... but there's a big fucking difference in the information we're being given by these two entities. IBD shows that a broker hasn't replenished any shares in 3 days, while Fintel is showing 6,400,000 shorted shares in a single day.</p>
<p>Where the hell are these shares being borrowed from? Or are they just being created by a market maker to sell themselves? I'm leaning toward a Bona Fide Market Maker is creating these shorts for themselves, without having to go to market to locate the borrow. I'm going to make a separate post about this later...</p>
<p>-<strong>Part 2: The Fundamentals</strong>-</p>
<p>Why does the market even care what we value GameStop at? Again, this isn't a rhetorical question. I'm legit curious why anyone cares if we think GameStop is worth $0 or $1,000,000 per share. The entire premise of a free and fair market is that a buyer and seller set the price. Anything else is irrelevant.</p>
<p>But, is it really irrelevant?</p>
<p>At $200 per share, GameStop has a $14bil market cap.</p>
<p>That's less than 3x revenue, based on previous sales... and sales are about to boom.</p>
<p>Every single dollar over their previous revenue that they earn on this upcoming report, is just a higher valuation for the stock to naturally sit at. There is a reason we haven't seen the price go too far under $200... and that's because the company is worth $200 a share. Not squoze, not propped-up by short hedgies buying shares... it's worth $200 per share. Based on fundamentals alone.</p>
<p>Stocks tend to be forward-looking by 6-18 months. I think this earnings report is going to paint a really bright picture for the 18 month future of GameStop.</p>
<p>Everyone keeps saying how brick and mortar is dead, but every GameStop location is currently profitable. It isn't about rotating out of brick and mortar into online-only... their physical locations are already generating money and brand recognition. It's just about revenue expansion, cost-cutting, and streamlining...</p>
<p>In my original DD back when GME was at $100, I told you how I felt that this quarters earnings are going to SMOKE expectations. I haven't changed my stance.</p>
<p>For instance, just think about the tailwind of Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon this year. Just wait until you hear what the trading card sales have done for their bottom line on the earnings call this week.</p>
<p>Ryan, if you're reading this and you guys don't have anything in your presentation planned to touch on the expansion of your footprint in the trading card sector... this is your wake-up call. Put that in there. It's going to turn into a huge revenue stream for you if you treat it correctly. You need to get your ass on the phone with Papa Hasbro/Nintendo and set up a direct distribution model to turn GameStops into mini Pokemarts and MTG centers for people to buy product at. And start selling booster boxes for fucks sake.</p>
<p>GameStop has revenue streams that they haven't even begun to tap into yet. Management has shit the bed for years and failed to innovate. The potential in GameStop is massive, it just wasn't being utilized. The brand recognition and multi-national footprint alone is valuable.</p>
<p>Look at it this way:</p>
<p>NKLA is a fucking scam, claims to have around 300 employees, produced $95,000 in annual revenue, and it has a market cap of $6bil. </p>
<p>GameStop has 5,500 physical locations, employs over 50,000 people, produced $5,000,000,000 in annual revenue, and has a current market cap of $14bil.</p>
<p>And the market has the balls to tell <em>US</em> what a good investment is?... Fuck off Cramer. Zero chance in hell that any analyst would debate me in real time and unscripted on the fundamentals of GameStop.</p>
<p>The old market is just pissed off that they missed out on something... just like they've been pissed off at Tesla for years. They'll do and say anything to protect their ego. It's not even just about money at this point. They have to prove they were right. GameStop will be sitting at $1200, and they'll be telling us how it's heading for $12.</p>
<p>-<strong>Part 3: The Volume</strong>-</p>
<p>Go check any of your favorite boomer stocks and look at the volume on Friday. I'll bet that most of them have a higher than normal volume showing on Friday due to witching day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coke: 15-20m average... 63.5mil on Friday</li>
<li>McD's: 3-4mil average... 7.5mil on Friday</li>
<li>JNJ: 5-10mil on average... 15mil on Friday</li>
<li>PG: 6-10mil on average... 20mil on Friday</li>
<li>Petco: 1-5mil on average... 10mil on Friday</li>
<li>GameStop: 50mil on average... 24mil on Friday (fuckery)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait. What?..</p>
<p>Now yes, I do realize that there are going to be some outlying companies that don't see an increase in trading volume on a quad witching day... </p>
<p>But GameStop's volume trended <em>negatively</em> for the day. And not just negative, but almost half of it's 50day and 200day daily volume averages. On a quad witching day when ETFs were rebalancing?..</p>
<p>So. You're telling me that on the one day that shorts were impossible to locate to borrow, that trading volume just happened to be half of its average... on the highest trading volume day of the year. Alrighty then.</p>
<p>-<strong>Part 4: The Options</strong>-</p>
<p>~10,500. </p>
<p>That's how many calls finished in the money for the 19Mar21 contracts at $200 on Friday. That's 1,050,000 shares that need to be delivered by Tuesday. That's 1.5% of the total actual float.</p>
<p>I've already explained to everyone how I believe two hedgies (or one hedgie with two accounts) are trading the same bundle of shares back and forth with each other to artificially inflate volume.</p>
<p>Trading 1,000,000 shares for a $00.0001 spread on an off-exchange pool costs $100 per 1,000,000 volume. I honestly believe that the daily short volume is closer to 75% of the actual daily open market activity, and that the remaining volume is a single hedgie (or two) trading the same shares to themselves at the 4th decimal point on an off-exchange to spoof volume and cover up the true short percentages.</p>
<p>We should see early this week how an extra 1,000,000 actual shares effects the price. Could be interesting. </p>
<p>Someone was trying hard to keep it under $200... it took 1,250,000 in volume in under a minute to keep the price over $200 to close at the bell. 1,250,000 shares in under a minute, and the price went straight sideways. </p>
<p>Those were ~1,000,000 shorts hitting the bid side but not being able to drop the price. No one sold 1,000,000 shares in the last 60 seconds when they have all of after hours to see where the price goes. Those were all shorts attacking the price before the bell.</p>
<p>Now, there were less than 400,000 shares up for delivery at $200. If the daily volume is truly as high as it's being shown to be... 400,000 shares shouldn't even make a blip on the daily chart... so why would someone fight so hard at the close to stop 400,000 shares?... Unless the actual volume is much lower...</p>
<p>-<strong>Conclusion: Have A Good Sunday!</strong></p>
<p>Rest up apes. Our battle continues.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>The day the Robinhood threads were circulating was 3/17/21. The day that shorts stopped being able to be located to borrow on IBD was 3/17/21. The day people started transferring out of RH and setting their accounts to strictly cash was 3/17/21...</p>
<p>Hmmmmmmmmm....</p>
<p><strong>Edit #2:</strong></p>
<p>For all my apes over on the Big Play level 2's... Arruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh! 🐳</p>
