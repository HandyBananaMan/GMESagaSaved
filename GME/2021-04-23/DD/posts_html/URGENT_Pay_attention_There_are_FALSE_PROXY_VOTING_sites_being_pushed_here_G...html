<p>Scroll to the bottom of their site, click on corporate, then Investor relations. The voting site listed is the correct site.
DO NOT USE ANY OTHERS. I don't know if others are legit or not, but I looked it up on GME website. I won't use the others.</p>
<p>Sorry, here's the link form GameStop website:
www.proxydocs.com/GME</p>
<p>EDIT: Honestly, I don't know for sure that these other sites are not legit, but it makes zero sense to this smooth brained ape, that there would be multiple sites for voting. Anyone smarter than me or who has more knowledge, please, speak up. You won't hurt my feelings by setting it straight.</p>
