<p>After reading your magnificently smooth brained posts, I have decided to vote my shares. When I called JP Morgan for my control number, the operator immediately asked, “Is this for GME?.” To which I asked, “Are alot of people asking for this number?” He simply replied, “Sigh..... yeah”. </p>
<p>We are doing it apes!! We have begun the catalyst which ignites our fueled rocket and takes our jacked tits to the moon 🚀 🌙!! I am so proud of each and every one of you!</p>
<p>Idk if I need to put this but none of this is financial advise. Apes don’t fight other apes and all that jazz.</p>
