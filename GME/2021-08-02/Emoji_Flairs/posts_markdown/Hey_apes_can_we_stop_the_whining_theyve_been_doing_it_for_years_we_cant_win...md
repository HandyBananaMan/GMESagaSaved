# Title: Hey apes, can we stop the whining "they've been doing it for years" "we can't win" "I don't care if I lose" bullshit. Tighten the fuck up and buy and hodl. We're at the part of The Big Short when institutions are mislabeling and driving prices up and the boys double down and buy more as they watch.

Suffer in silence. It's fine to vent and feel stress. But posting it in the echo chamber is spreading FUD. Look around at your fellow apes eating ramen and taking their accounts negative. Making daily sacrifices for the chance of glory. Do us all a favor and stfu about your fears, uncertainties, and doubts. All we need is strength. EVERY DAY there's talk of investigations, new evidence. It's dumped at the feet of regulators over and over again. The message is out there, it's screamed louder each day as our grip tightens. Suck up your uncertainty, don't let it seep into your mind for a moment, don't let it loosen your grip. If you believe today every thing you've learned about this fraudulent system then tighten your damn grip because the end is coming and we're driving this rocket straight through their fucking hearts. Homeless or moon. Prison or bankruptcy. Fuk lambo, I'm here for justice for humanity.

Edit: this got way more attention than I thought it would. I fucking love every single one of you apes. This has been an amazing journey and I learned so much more than I thought I ever would, not just about the market and economy but also about just good wholesome people that want more for each other. I'm hyped to see the great things everyone does post-moass. Keep hodling, see y'all on the damn moon. Obligatory not financial advice 💎✊🏾🚀🚀

Edit: You guys are jacking me to the tits with these awards damn it! Thank you! Take care of each other. See you tomorrow. And if not tomorrow then the next day 🤝🏾
