Just a playdoh-munching ape with a rambling problem and a stubborn interest in Wall Street's unscrupulous activities. Remember; **hedge funds thrive from making money off EVERY TRANSACTION**.

Jeff Bezos maintained Wall Street relationships and breached anti-competitive corporate law to ensure competitors could not pivot to e-commerce in a time sensitive fashion. It is clear that multiple conflicts of interest went unchallenged, this helped to establish a narrative while relying on hedge funds to naked short competitors stocks using HFT strategies used at D.E Shaw.**\n\n**The combined cost to society of Sears/Kmart, Toys R Us and Borders Group Bankruptcies = 121,000 JOBS + billions in taxpayer dollars.
