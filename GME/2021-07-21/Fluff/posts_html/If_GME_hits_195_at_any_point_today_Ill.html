<p>If GME hits $195 today I will drink 10 glasses of water instead of 8 and I'll hike an extra 2 miles with the pup today.  I'm a fairly overweight/ unhealthy man and for the last 6 weeks after some encouragement from all you apes I've been eating healthy and exercising.  I've lost 30lbs and feel absolutely amazing and it's all thanks to GME and you beautiful apes, so thank you very much. I can't wait to hit my goals and start to change this world for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>EDIT. After seeing all of your beautiful comments I'll be doing it either way,  when GME hits $195 that will just be the cherry on top. If any of you are actually interested in updates I can do a weekly post, I started at 335 pounds 6 weeks ago and my goal is to be somewhere around 210 pounds.</p>
