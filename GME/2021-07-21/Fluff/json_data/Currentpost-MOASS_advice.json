    "selftext": "I made some money during the January rally, around $600k. Back then a lot of us played options. DON\u2019T BUY OPTIONS, BUY SHARES.\n\nAnyhow, I have unfortunately learned a lot about money since then. I\u2019m writing this at 5am so forgive me \n\n1. **NOBODY has your best interest at heart but you**. This includes friends, financial youtubers, Twitter traders, analysts, and so on.\n1. **Don\u2019t tell others about your new-found wealth**. Including Friends or family. Keep it to you and your partner.\n1. **Pay off your debts.** It\u2019s so relieving to be able to pay it all off at once.\n1. Friends might initially be happy for you, but over time their jealousy will blossom. They might turn vile, treat you differently, and even wonder whether you\u2019re lying about your money.\n1. Don\u2019t brag to strangers (ie gym regulars, whatever). They will expect favors. If you\u2019re known as the rich guy, or lady, they might be nice to you because they think there\u2019s something in it for them.\n1. Overhaul your closet. Throw out all those old clothes that no longer fit you. Buy new shoes\u2014all sorts of shoes for different occasions.\n1. **Once the monetary aspect is gone, you realize how important genuine relationships are.**\n1. If someone asks how you\u2019re able to afford X, you can either decline to disclose ie \u201csorry, none of your business\u201d or to be nice \u201csaved up some money\u201d. Your finances are for you only. Not their business or problem.\n1. **Take a vacation! Enjoy life. Do what truly make you happy!**\n1. **Clear your mind**. Figure out what your next steps are, and what do you want to do with your money. Remember, **you don\u2019t HAVE to rush to do anything.** \n\nAnyways. Biggest advice is to keep your money to yourself. You don\u2019t owe ANYONE absolutely ANYTHING.",
