<p>I noticed that in the last couple of days a mutual fund that I hold in my 401k has added a position in Gamestop.</p>
<p>Vanguard Value Index Fund Admiral Shares (<strong>VVIAX</strong>)</p>
<p>or as an ETF</p>
<p>Vanguard Value ETF (<strong>VTV</strong>)</p>
<p>If you check out the <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VTV/portfolio-holdings">holdings</a> page, you will notice that it now has 223,774 shares of GME. Last week it had 0. This means that it now meets the funds criteria of being one of the most undervalued large cap stocks.</p>
<p>Despite claims to the contrary by some in the mainstream media, it seems that GME is still a value play according to Vanguard.</p>
