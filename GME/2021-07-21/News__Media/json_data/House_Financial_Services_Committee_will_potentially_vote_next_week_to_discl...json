    "selftext": "* Lawmakers are [considering](https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/archegos-blowup-spurs-house-democrats-demands-for-tougher-rules) increased financial regulation on hedge funds after this year's implosion of Archegos Capital\u00a0and Robinhood's temporary ban on the purchase of\u00a0 Gamestop , and other stocks.\n* There are over a dozen proposals under consideration, including banning market makers, like Citadel Securities, from paying Robinhood to carry out investor trades and requiring hedge funds to disclose any short-selling or similar bets against stocks to the public.\n* Payment for order flow, a practice in which trading firms pay brokers like Robinhood to execute their orders, is likely to be studied by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if regulation is needed. One proposal would stop market-makers from trading ahead of retail stock transactions.\n* The House Financial Services Committee may vote as soon as next week on which proposals will go to the full House for confirmation.\n\nNow, I don't expect them to vote on disclosing any short-selling, cause would be too great of them, right? But, maybe they will ban PFOF and sink Robinhood and others...\n\nAlso, interestingly, how does Archegos Capital relate to short selling? The story goes it over-leveraged on short position on Viacom and Discovery and went bust after they sank. Or....tin hat on, it had a short position on GME and went down because GME shoot from 100 to 250 in March. Can it be that Archegos Capital\u00a0caused the spike in March?\n\nAnyway, I know we said no dates, but House Financial Services Committee votes next week and it sounds like a fucking date to me!!!",
