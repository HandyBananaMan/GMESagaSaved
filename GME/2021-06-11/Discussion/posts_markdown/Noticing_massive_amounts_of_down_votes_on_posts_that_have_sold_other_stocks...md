# Title: Noticing massive amounts of down votes on posts that have sold other stocks to buy the GME dip. I'm wondering if SHF shills are trying to keep it quiet 🤔

I'm all for AMC Apes and Apettes cashing in on the AMC squeeze, but there is only One True MOASS and that's GME. It seems SHFs don't want us to jump ship for some reason.  

If you go to r/amcstock and filter by "top" and "all time" and do the same for r/superstonk there is night and day difference. No mention of any kind of DD on AMC, mainly screenshots.

If you filter by flair "DD" or "Shit DD" there is not anything worth while flaired "DD" and "Shit DD" are posts that seem to be posts by shills. Out of 325k users there are only 69.9k users online. Superstonk activity? 156k out of 425k. 

I'm not hating on AMC stock or Apes, but there is clearly something wrong with this picture. Yes AMC stocks are shorted but nothing in comparison to GME. MSM talks about AMC but barely about GME. Popular YouTubers' focusing on meme stocks focus mainly on AMC. They only include GME to appease the GME crowd and don't even talk about DD.  GME is changing as a company and for the better.

GME is what scares the SHFs and not AMC. They know GME is the One and Only True MOASS and they are afraid of us Apes holding it until ♾️

Just how Apes need to get out of RH, Apes need to get out of AMC. I hope I'm wrong about this and I hope AMC Apes don't become bag holders. This will probably get down voted to oblivion.

Buy GME, HODL GME. Buckle up.
