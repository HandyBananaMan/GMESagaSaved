Far too many posts of screenshots showing more shares outstanding than previous days for it to be a coincidence. This is what RC means, he's saying pay attention, sit up and watch him raise $1.2 billion for the company that YOU (and I) own.

Not to line anyone's pockets but yours, apes, creating shareholder value by transforming this company into a world-beater, all made possible because of your diamond hands and feverish, maniacal and glorious buying of the dips.

Buckle up you beautiful bastards, we got a rocket to catch.
