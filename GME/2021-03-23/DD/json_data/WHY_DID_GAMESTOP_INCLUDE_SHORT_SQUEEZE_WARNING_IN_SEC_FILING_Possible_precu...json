    "selftext": "First of all, the following is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor.\n\nFor those that missed it, GameStop warned those holding short positions about the potential of a squeeze in their 10K SEC filing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iiua9wwl2vo61.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71ce1943da224b36cc5b9a3b1578ab2d6ea14d70\n\nThanks to  [u/JabbaLeSlut](https://www.reddit.com/user/JabbaLeSlut/) for the original post of this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbq7p5/huge_warning_to_shorts_in_gme_10k_doc/).\n\n# If you are wondering (like I was) why they would do this, I think I found the answer. The SEC asked them to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4s2g91m9vo61.jpg?width=608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a063df7995bb183555bd6bc79f2fdc1ab2436561\n\n[Full Article](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/sample-letter-securities-offerings-during-extreme-price-volatility)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~Looks like GameStop could just be checking off the boxes they need to in order to make sure they're complying with an SEC recommendation (CYA)~~ *(SEE EDIT 5 for why I'm striking this out)* but I think it's important to note that their filing specified the short interest as the reason for volatility not retail traders.\n\nBlame properly placed! Real cause finally publicized and called out!\n\n**I think it's also very telling that this statement even being in this report indicates that this is far from over (just want to make that clear for anyone that might be wondering because of the price drop after hours and unending FUD campaign).**\n\n**\"Squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements\".**\n\nTLDR: The \ud83d\ude80 launch is still on. GME just doing some final pre-flight checks. Strap in and HOLD on!  **\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Another item on the pre-flight checklist gets crossed off tomorrow. [Great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbgn48/nssc002_and_nssc801_update/)  by  [u/ReBjorn65](https://www.reddit.com/user/ReBjorn65/).\n\nEdit 2: Excellent [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbtpwa/with_regard_to_the_theyre_just_defining_a_short/) by  [u/BeanDaddyMac](https://www.reddit.com/user/BeanDaddyMac/) explaining how the language used by GameStop in this release is not just standard SEC filing info and those that are saying so are spreading FUD.\n\nEdit 3: Modifying Flair from news to DD\n\nEdit 4:  u/budgetdiamondhands put this in the comments and I thought it was both relevant and important enough to add to the post. This doesn't necessarily mean that GameStop will but it does mean that they can.  This came from page 32 of the same [10K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593)!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmb83ir96wo61.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6adaa312ab1574e969264cc73ebeefef721a504\n\nEdit 5: Great points made about the official confirmation that over 100% of the float is shorted and further explanation that this paragraph was not just about checking the box and doing a CYA.
