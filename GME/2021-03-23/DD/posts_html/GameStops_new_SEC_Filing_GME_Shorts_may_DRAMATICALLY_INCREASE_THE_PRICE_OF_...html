<p>Everything below is a direct quote from the report, with bold emphasis and formatting added by me.</p>
<p><strong><em>"A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.</em></strong></p>
<p>Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate <strong>short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market</strong>, investors with short exposure <strong>may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares</strong> of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.</p>
<p>Those repurchases may in turn, <strong>dramatically increase the price of shares</strong> of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as <strong>a “short squeeze.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>A large proportion</strong> of our Class A Common Stock <strong>has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood</strong> that our Class A Common Stock <strong>will be the target of a short squeeze.</strong></p>
<p>A short squeeze has led and <strong>could continue to lead to volatile price movements</strong> in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, <strong>once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions</strong>, the price of our Class A Common Stock <strong>may rapidly decline</strong>.</p>
<p>Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment."</p>
