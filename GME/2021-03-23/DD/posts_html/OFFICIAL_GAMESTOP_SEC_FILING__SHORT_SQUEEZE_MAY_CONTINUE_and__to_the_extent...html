<p><strong><em>A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.</em></strong></p>
<p>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. <strong>To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market</strong>, <strong>investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.</strong> Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”</p>

<p>EDIT - KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR ME.</p>
<p>They recognise that</p>
<p>- shorting is over 100% of float</p>
<p>- It is continuing</p>
<p>- Shorts should expect to return to lenders - potentially paving way for a catalyst regarding shareholding meeting, voting, special dividend or other intervention forcing return to lenders</p>
