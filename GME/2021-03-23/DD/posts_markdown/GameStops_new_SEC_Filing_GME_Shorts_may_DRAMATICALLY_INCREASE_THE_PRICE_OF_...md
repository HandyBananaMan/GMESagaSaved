Everything below is a direct quote from the report, with bold emphasis and formatting added by me.

***"A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.***

Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate **short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market**, investors with short exposure **may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares** of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.

Those repurchases may in turn, **dramatically increase the price of shares** of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as **a “short squeeze.”**

**A large proportion** of our Class A Common Stock **has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood** that our Class A Common Stock **will be the target of a short squeeze.**

A short squeeze has led and **could continue to lead to volatile price movements** in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, **once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions**, the price of our Class A Common Stock **may rapidly decline**.

Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment."
