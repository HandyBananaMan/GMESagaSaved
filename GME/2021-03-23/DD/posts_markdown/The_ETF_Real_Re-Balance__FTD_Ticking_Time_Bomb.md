First, I'd like to thank u/Augrr for all his help finishing and compiling the rest of this DD to come to some conclusions also u/NordyDave for putting together some pieces into how this plays into FTDs. Second, I'm not a financial advisor and all of this is opinion and data gathered from publicly available sources.  Key Fact: 1,705,385 shares have been pulled out of the ETFs containing GME (not including Vangard) between Quad Witching Eve 3.18.2021 and Today 3.23.2021. Some very key ones such as XRT.

HFs will have no source now to continue hiding naked short positions by taking real ETF shares and replacing them with their borrowed shares.

If they can't do that, then that makes the ETF rebalance on Friday (t+2) in effect 3/22. If I'm not mistaken this would mean a drop in price because the ETFs are offloading their shares.

But... that means anyone naked shorting will FTD on their short positions. So after 5 days they have a load of FTDs on their plate that they have to declare.

Once they can't declare that, then it'll stay as a FTD, they'll try their best to clear but if there are FTDs of over 0.5% (there are) then after 13 days it's threshold security territory.

*In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered* ***clearing agency must immediately purchase shares*** *to close out failures to deliver in securities with large and persistent failures to deliver, referred to as “threshold securities,”* ***if the failures to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days***

Please poke holes in the research and let us know if there was anything that was missed. Research is never done until peer reviewed and even then you must go back and re-test.

Different re-balancing strategies. With equities it’s likely CCPI. [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp)

**\*\*There will be another re-balance tomorrow as it is the end of the financial quarter for ETF's. Look for my data to come from me...**

Some unintended findings: **SWAPS** (many by some usual suspects)
