***A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.***

Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. **To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market**, **investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.** Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”

EDIT - KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR ME.

 They recognise that

 \- shorting is over 100% of float

 \- It is continuing

 \- Shorts should expect to return to lenders - potentially paving way for a catalyst regarding shareholding meeting, voting, special dividend or other intervention forcing return to lenders
