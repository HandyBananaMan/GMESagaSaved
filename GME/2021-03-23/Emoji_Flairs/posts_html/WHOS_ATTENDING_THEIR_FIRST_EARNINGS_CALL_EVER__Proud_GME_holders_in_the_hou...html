<p>I’ve held stock of various companies over the past year and NEVER attended an earnings call, much less voted. But GME has changed that!! I’m diamond handed and committed to the company I believe in! PS: the call is at 11pm in my time zone! Let’s do this! 🚀🚀</p>
<p>Edit 1 - http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=143221</p>
<p>Edit 2 - One hour to game time and it’s ALREADY reached max capacity!! A big EFF YOU to all the media outlets that said “Forget GameStop, XXXXX is the next...”. No one has forgotten GME by the looks of this call!!!</p>
<p>Edit 3 - The call is at 5pm eastern time.</p>
<p>Edit 4 - I’m seeing several YouTube links for live streams being shared on the Daily Discussion chat for those who can’t get in using the link above.</p>
<p>Edit 5 - THE REPORT IS OUT. LOOKS POSITIVE!! https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2020-results</p>
