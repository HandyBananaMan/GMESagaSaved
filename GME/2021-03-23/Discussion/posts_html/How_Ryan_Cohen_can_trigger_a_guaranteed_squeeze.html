<p><strong>TLDR: None of the shareholder “recalls” will work. You can only force a recall if the shorts have no other way to compensate a shareholder. That can be done with a crypto dividend.</strong></p>
<p>There's been a lot of talk going around that for the squeeze to trigger, Gamestop needs to force shareholders who are lending out their stock (institutions like Black Rock) to recall their shares.</p>
<p>Here are some moves that were suggested and ultimately won't work:</p>
<p><strong>1. Emergency shareholder meeting</strong><br />
This won't work because it was tried last year: <br />

<p>The institutions cannot be forced to recall their shares since they can simply abstain from voting.</p>
<p><strong>2. Paying out a dividend</strong><br />
This won't work because the shorts can simply pay out the dividend to the borrower:<br />

<p>The shorts would gladly pay the dividend rather than get squozed. Plus GME is not in position to pay a dividend when they need the cash to expand the business. </p>
<p><strong>3. Splitting the stock</strong><br />
Splitting of stock does not require stock lenders to recall their stock. It just requires the shorter to return n times as many shares as before, which would be at net market value anyway: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-stock-split-why-do-stocks-split/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20a,return%20them%20to%20the%20lender">https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-stock-split-why-do-stocks-split/#:\~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20a,return%20them%20to%20the%20lender</a>. </p>
<p><strong>4. Stock Buy Back</strong><br />
The odds of this happening are pretty much 0. They discussed in the earnings meeting today that they would actually consider selling <em>more</em> stock despite the fact that there are tons above the actual float out there. And as mentioned before, they need the cash.</p>
<p><strong>SO WHAT IS THE GUARANTEED WAY FOR GAMESTOP TO TRIGGER A SQUEEZE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>***OFFER A CRYPTO TO ALL SHAREHOLDERS***</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock, in his final act before resigning, created a crypto dividend to get back at the shorts (who were naked short selling Overstock for years similar to GME):</p>

<p>The short Hedge Funds sued and lost, making it completely legal:</p>

<p>Gamestop might not even need to pay out a crypto dividend. Simply getting involved in crypto as part of the business seems to make people very bullish on top of  scaring the shit out of shorts. Check out what happened today to this company when they announced they were getting involved in crypto:</p>
