<p>From Reuters:</p>
<p>" Wall Street analysts are doubtful Cohen - a college dropout who says he learned the ins and outs of business from his late father, who was a glass importer - can win back GameStop customers who have become accustomed to streaming video games. Some are struggling to understand why the creator of the worldâ€™s most valuable online pet supplies store would take on a moribund video game retailer as a turnaround project. "</p>

<p>Fuck those analysts. Ryan Cohen is a proven quantity. He turned Chewy from a 23M$/year company into a 40BN$ powerhouse that was ripping chunks out of Amazon's market share. The dude is legitimately a BILLIONAIRE at age 35. 'He'S a CoLlEgE dRoPoUt!' get fucked reuters. This shit got me fucking mad.</p>

<p>Edit: Why the fuck does this have like 800 upvotes. I was just mad drinking my morning coffee. Save your awards and put it towards a safer investment. I love you Apes. </p>
<p>Fuck Reuters.  /EndEdit</p>
