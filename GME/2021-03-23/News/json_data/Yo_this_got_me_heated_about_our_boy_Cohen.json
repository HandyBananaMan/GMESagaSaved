    "selftext": "From Reuters:\n\n\" Wall Street analysts are doubtful Cohen - a college dropout who says he learned the ins and outs of business from his late father, who was a glass importer - can win back GameStop customers who have become accustomed to streaming video games. Some are struggling to understand why the creator of the world\u2019s most valuable online pet supplies store would take on a moribund video game retailer as a turnaround project. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck those analysts. Ryan Cohen is a proven quantity. He turned Chewy from a 23M$/year company into a 40BN$ powerhouse that was ripping chunks out of Amazon's market share. The dude is legitimately a BILLIONAIRE at age 35. 'He'S a CoLlEgE dRoPoUt!' get fucked reuters. This shit got me fucking mad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Why the fuck does this have like 800 upvotes. I was just mad drinking my morning coffee. Save your awards and put it towards a safer investment. I love you Apes. \n\nFuck Reuters.  /EndEdit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArticle:\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-cohen-insight/from-pet-food-to-video-games-inside-ryan-cohens-gamestop-obsession-idUSKBN2BF1AS](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-cohen-insight/from-pet-food-to-video-games-inside-ryan-cohens-gamestop-obsession-idUSKBN2BF1AS)",
