This is great, but why?\ud83d\ude0e\n\nTo me, It shows that the hedge fund are running out of buying power, and apes are HODL strong. \u2705\n\nRight before major pops in gme, we saw volume decrease IMMENSELY. don\u2019t forget, we saw volume go over 100 mil end of January. We are seeing a major decrease in volume, but the stock is trading sideways \ud83d\udea8\n\nToday is the earnings call, and from yesterday, I expected them to do every last thing they can to make GameStop look like a failed company via the stock market. So I pre-ordered the snazzy banana cat and picked up a few switch games \ud83d\udc8ePersonally, I just like the stock \ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: once again, if u see this, bots failed \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit 2: 1:34 EST 6.17 MIL volume\n\nEdit 3: just one of the reasons I love this sub, just wasted 10 minutes of my life reading a comment thread below about dishwashers \ud83d\ude0e\n\nEdit 4: also just posted a $Gme hook and verse in honor of all you apes. check it out if you like music :)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbl0wz/jungle_gme_apes_written_by_me_please_take_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nEdit 5: 2:52 EST 7.50 MIL volume\n\nEdit 6: 3:08 EST 8.28 MIL volume\n\nEdit 7: 10.4 AT THE \ud83d\udd14\n\nEdit 8: 13.87 MIL AT 5:53 EST\n\nI\u2019ll just leave this here, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbpclz/gme_yolo_update_mar_23_2021/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nQuick edit 9: patience is a virtue \ud83d\udc8e\n\nEdit 10: seems as if my prediction was possibly correct, \u201cdo every last thing they can to make GameStop look like a failed company via the stock market\u201d. I listed in on the earnings call, and I was pleased with what I heard. Who knows maybe hedgies r completely dumping their shares cuz they know they fuk. Just speculation and opinion tho \ud83e\udd1d",
