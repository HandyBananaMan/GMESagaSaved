EST 12:55pm 3/23 (or 23/3, for u oversea apes)

Edits through-out

volume is once again piss low. Even lower than expected in my opinion. This is great, but why?😎

To me, It shows that the hedge fund are running out of buying power, and apes are HODL strong. ✅

Right before major pops in gme, we saw volume decrease IMMENSELY. don’t forget, we saw volume go over 100 mil end of January. We are seeing a major decrease in volume, but the stock is trading sideways 🚨

Today is the earnings call, and from yesterday, I expected them to do every last thing they can to make GameStop look like a failed company via the stock market. So I pre-ordered the snazzy banana cat and picked up a few switch games 💎Personally, I just like the stock 🚀

Edit: once again, if u see this, bots failed 🤣

Edit 2: 1:34 EST 6.17 MIL volume

Edit 3: just one of the reasons I love this sub, just wasted 10 minutes of my life reading a comment thread below about dishwashers 😎

Edit 4: also just posted a $Gme hook and verse in honor of all you apes. check it out if you like music :)

Quick edit 9: patience is a virtue 💎

Edit 10: seems as if my prediction was possibly correct, “do every last thing they can to make GameStop look like a failed company via the stock market”. I listed in on the earnings call, and I was pleased with what I heard. Who knows maybe hedgies r completely dumping their shares cuz they know they fuk. Just speculation and opinion tho 🤝
