This is not investment advice, I am not an investment advisor.

Being on the wrong side of losing sucks, but who gets screwed in both scenarios? You guessed it banks.

Maybe it’s time American ~~Finance~~ Greed figures out how to structure risk profiles and loans properly?

Oh by the way, margin call at 8:30AM EST is extremely likely but not certain, when rule \*801 goes into effect the fit will hit the Shan.

![Also read my thoughts on CSOs. ‘08 leverage on Lehman Bros was 30.7 to 1. imagine with COVID19 temporary rulings, 33.3 to 1 on top of a 50 to 1 CSO leverage.](https://preview.redd.it/nbbz2ydprvo61.jpg?width=913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e776d4f8acc74a470296d25cdb666de0fb1ecd6c)

\*003 rule ripped off the bandaid to allow synthetic shorts to hide behind a monthly check.

\*801 enforces daily checks. **COMING SOON TO A THEATER NEAR YOU** (publishes in a few hours)

Edit2: still not SEC approved, what are they waiting on??? [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings)
