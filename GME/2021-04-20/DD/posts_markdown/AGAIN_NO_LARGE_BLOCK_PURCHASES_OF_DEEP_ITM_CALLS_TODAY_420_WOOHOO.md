Welcome back to another episode of DANS DEEP ITM CALLS, I'm your host [u/Dan\_Bren](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dan_Bren/). I hope everyone is having a happy holiday, let's get right into it.

As you can see from the image above there were no large block purchases of DEEP ITM calls. This makes 10 out of the last 12 days without any large block purchases. The silence on their end is deafening. Gotta love it. Keeping this one short it's absolutely beautiful out and I've been shuttered inside of work all day. Be sure to get out and ~~enjoy the weather~~ stock up on crayons for the coming week. To me there is no better way to relieve stress. As always I will keep you posted.

See ya tomorrow!
