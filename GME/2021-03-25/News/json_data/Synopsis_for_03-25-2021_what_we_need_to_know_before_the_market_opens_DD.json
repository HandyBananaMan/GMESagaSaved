    "selftext": "Good morning San Diago,\n\nI am Rensole,\n\nI love lamp!\n\n\\*insert flashy intro card\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/redbcaba55p61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=a850e8efbdb6ec698d49f88ea62914523d87724f\n\nnone of this is financial advice.\n\n# Umm.. 1 million percent shorted?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aj6jir4l55p61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2a8960113b661825816813d77c74780a7fae46\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I was getting pinged all over this thread, let me make it clear.\n\nThis.is.a.bug.\n\nFor the people a little more familiar with the stock markets, this stuff is old as hell, I mean they probably haven't upgraded their systems since windows XP.\n\nBlackrock changed and renamed some of their ETFs, and the system isn't handling it well.\n\nJKI is an ETF name that's no longer active, it had no GME in it as far as I can tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ucjbqmp65p61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ea17819954eb4d407958989f1939d97c4db2b4d\n\n# Gme Crashing yesterday\n\nso as most of you have seen, gme was crashing yesterday with about 30ish%, but we didn't have enough volumes at those times actually give us that low of a price so... what gives?\n\nAh my friend welcome to the fucked up life of a stock owner.\n\nIf you look at the ETF's at that some time they were getting shorted into oblivion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkqh31i275p61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec36e50706767022b24d3cf55e91aaa7e65ab3a3\n\nAnd at the same time the dip happened (and some a little before) we started seeing the usual FUD campaign by the media\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7xykb8p675p61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=35199e5e4f2abea062b79531955fa03b0024cca6\n\nSo taking these things into account, lets take a look at some indicators, mainly the OBV\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mchty9/gme\\_technicals\\_obv\\_showing\\_little\\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mchty9/gme_technicals_obv_showing_little_real/)\n\nas to quote from the op:\n\nI'm looking at OBV on GME. For smoother apes, OBV adds the volume on up-ticks and subtracts the volume on down-ticks to create a relative (i.e. its absolute value means nothing) indicator of buying/selling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow it seems that the price has been disconnected since the spike in January, what does that mean? it means everyone is HODLing and right now we have a disconnect between a lot of price indicators and the actual price. This in turn could point to blatent market manipulation.\n\nwell we just have to wait right? yes get the dip and hodl is still the best strategy we have.\n\nBut we seem to be forgetting one simple thing, twitter. it was the weapon for the ex president of the usa and he was only one single dude.\n\nMaybe it would be good to write ALL the SEC people on twitter, remember we have a lot of numbers on here and if 1 person says something it may get lost to the void, of 200k+ people tell them to do their jobs, that's a different story.\n\nBut right now it seems that the price is not reflective of it's worth, meaning that the price is being suppressed by nefarious methods via ETF's and OTC pools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow are OTC pools the same as \"Dark\" pools?No\n\n[pic of OTC](https://preview.redd.it/3tbu7i51a5p61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=476c42391dd1cbc8700d7fb43bc4b758430a3a04)\n\nI'll let a smarter person explain this :\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcrfak/alexis\\_goldstein\\_response\\_on\\_finra\\_otc\\_nonats\\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcrfak/alexis_goldstein_response_on_finra_otc_nonats_data/)\n\nAlexis Goldstein gives a response and explains what's what.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut let's circle back to the FTD DD ([https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/))\n\nWe have been seeing a lower SI right?\n\nOk let me try to get a wrinkle here and please work with me.\n\nwhat if shorters are using synthetic longs to simulate they are returning the shares they are borrowing for shorting?\n\nThis would result in (1) lowering the SI% and people would think the squeeze probability is lower (2) this means they could have claimed that they had \"covered\" their positions with the house of finance hearing because they \"covered\" the open positions with synthetic longs (kicking the can further down the road) and because those positions where \"closed\" the SI would decline, meaning they could continue with synthetic/naked shorting.\n\nThis plan is kindof getting screwed because:(1)   GameStop officially said in their 10K that more than 100% of the float is shorted  (be it if they're speaking at the end of the fiscal year or current)\n\n(2) the new NSCC and DTCC rules\n\nWith this they have lost this plausibility and their ability to produce more naked shorts becomes limited, or at least it enters a notably more dangerous territory. Consequently, they are starting to have trouble returning the stocks they borrow because they cannot print more to simulate they are covering them. If so, SI interest will start to go up (there was a \\~3x increase yesterday), and it would potentially lead to disclosing the shitshow they have dig themselves in.\n\nI'd like to give thanks to u/whatever_username_ who messaged me about this and this makes perfect sense to me, because the fact that it's getting harder and harder to do what they have been doing also coincides nicely with the switch to OTC.\n\nAnd also why the numbers of \"borrowable shares\" has started declining bit by bit, so much so that from 12 yesterday afternoon the rest of the day was stuck at around 0.\n\nso the FTD's are getting F'ed in the A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8cdw0hn85p61.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dee7bef4e2ffe57347f3886a5075f91e463f2c0d\n\n# Sec closed door meeting today\n\nMeeting scheduled for, March 25, 2021 | 2:30 pm ET\n\n\"The subject matter of the closed meeting will consist of the following topics:\n\nInstitution and settlement of injunctive actions;\n\nInstitution and settlement of administrative proceedings;\n\nResolution of litigation claims; and\n\nOther matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gia8mtzq85p61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bb26fe48742fef6764cd58b051bb6d22923dc36\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bir4ec5s85p61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f58d15d3b8df749e80e73de425e501c8df454e\n\nHmmmm just at the time nscc-2021-003 is implemented and they're going to implement new rules? hmmmm what ever could they be talking about today?\n\nwell lets hope that after the meeting we will find out whatsup, until then it will be speculation.\n\nI think they'll be talking about the new rules\n\nSR-NSCC-2021-004.\n\nand the DTCC 801\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc8trw/dtcc\\_just\\_filed\\_another\\_rule\\_yesterday\\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc8trw/dtcc_just_filed_another_rule_yesterday_that/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why is GME so silent?\n\nok I've been seeing this one pop up quite a bit so lets go into some business 101.\n\nFirst of all if you look at the letter RC ventures and GME signed which gave Ryan Cohen 19.9% of all stocks, Ryan Cohen is not allowed to speak on behalf of the company or buy more shares until 2022.\n\nSo RC can't officially speak on behalf or regarding GME right now, but seeing how much of the current board is changing and that almost all the \"old blood\" will be gone by June's shareholder meeting, this silence period of his may be (hopefully) shorter.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000119380521000031/e620202\\_ex99-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000119380521000031/e620202_ex99-1.htm)\n\n    Standstill Provisions.\n    \n     \n    \n    (a) RC Ventures agrees that, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier \n    of (x) the date that is thirty (30) calendar days prior to the deadline for \n    the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the \n    Company\u2019s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to the By-Laws or \n    (y) the date that is one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the first\n    anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), \n    RC Ventures shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Associates \n    not to, in each case directly or indirectly, in any manner:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy is GameStop themselves so quiet?\n\nEasy most of the board is leaving, so this means there have been lots of closed door meetings and a lot of things will change because of these meetings.\n\nIf you have a background in business you know, this is something that needs scalpel precision not a sledgehammer.\n\nso expect them to implement changes and to hear about it later, GameStop said it themselves in their 10k filing that they are fiscally healthy enough to not need to release bonds, they're healthy enough to NOT need to raise capital even right in the middle of transforming a company, THATS INSANE!!\n\nseriously normally when some company goes through a transformation it needs money, so it releases a roadmap so investors may see their tendies and want to invest. this time... nah we got enough cash to do this we don't need help we got this fam.\n\nSo expect GameStop to suddenly SHOW what they have changed instead of going \"this is what we will change\". the first method is way more bullish imo, it shows vision and courage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mggd023kb5p61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38ac6ff1c4cce6b7c854def420bcc6b24e0b3476\n\n# Death Threats and harassments\n\nSo as some of you may have read on u/heyitspixel's twitter, he has been getting death threats and getting harassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t22180iyb5p61.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c58c0ec4619b50d2d9bde97aa6934723b27e713\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c3dgnss0c5p61.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e64105420d37253fd419960dcf72bfc50f517c4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zzjk66l3c5p61.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2aafb53577f523328945b87af6119d984899c01\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/94iq6cl5c5p61.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd678719cdc6e802d62664fd4940615fee2ce4e0\n\nUnfortunately Both Pixel and I have been getting loads of these and let me be clear about this, I won't stand for harassment, be it against me or other users, know that we have both contacted reddit for this and we are both filing police reports concerning these threats.\n\nIdc if it's just trolling or actual threats, but we are both not taking this lightly and neither is reddit and the police.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ziepct6g5p61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e9ec217fa4fbc1d6acb02fb09e2f3f72c85f8ed\n\n# That's amore\n\nJune 10th will be the

EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\nApe don't fight ape, apes help other apes\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we

my btc is on my profile as always.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last thing before I go, I've seen people complain about \"what if the price go's down back to 40/45/50?\", I'll double maybe even triple my position, at this point I personally feel it would be extremely undervalued at 40/50 range.\n\nSo if you're worried of the price going down you must be new here or don't know a lot of what's been going on, so relax, read all the DD you can and you'll feel fine.\n\nThe best weapon against anxiety in business is competence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1:\n\nFor all you smooth brains who recently transferred to new brokers, contact them to make sure your shares are not being lent out. it seems Fidelity is doing so, so if you don't want them to use your shares to short, contact them\n\n(this used to be about fidelity but contact your broker regardless to make sure they treat your shares the way you would want, if you don't want them to be borrowed out tell your broker and make sure, dont assume)\n\nEdit
