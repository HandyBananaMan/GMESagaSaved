    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI thought why not check how [citadel.com](https://citadel.com) was changing during the GME saga, maybe that will give us some clues of what's happening behind the stage. And guess what? It really does.\n\n# Homepage:\n\nThe first thing they did on Jan 28th was removing the Contact page from their site entirely. And it's still missing lol, not a big surprise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Jan 15th 2021 on the left.

Bye-bye.\n\n[Jan 20th 2021 on the left.

I tried to google any press releases about these guys leaving, but found nothing. Do you have any information about them leaving? \n\nI mean Special Advisor to the CEO and a Global Treasurer disappearing from the homepage without any PR is sus AF, isn't it?\n\nP.S. I also checked all the other pages side to side for the changes, but there were no significant changes made.\n\nEdit 1: Holy smokes, thanks for the Platinum, kind stranger! My first Platinum ever.",
