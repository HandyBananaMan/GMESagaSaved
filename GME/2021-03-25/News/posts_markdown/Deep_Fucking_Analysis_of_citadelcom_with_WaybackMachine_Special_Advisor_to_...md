Hey guys,

I thought why not check how [citadel.com](https://citadel.com) was changing during the GME saga, maybe that will give us some clues of what's happening behind the stage. And guess what? It really does.

# Homepage:

The first thing they did on Jan 28th was removing the Contact page from their site entirely. And it's still missing lol, not a big surprise.

Isn't it interesting, guys? I tried to google any press releases about these guys leaving, but found nothing. Do you have any information about them leaving? 

I mean Special Advisor to the CEO and a Global Treasurer disappearing from the homepage without any PR is sus AF, isn't it?

P.S. I also checked all the other pages side to side for the changes, but there were no significant changes made.

Edit 1: Holy smokes, thanks for the Platinum, kind stranger! My first Platinum ever.
