<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I thought why not check how <a href="https://citadel.com">citadel.com</a> was changing during the GME saga, maybe that will give us some clues of what's happening behind the stage. And guess what? It really does.</p>
<h1>Homepage:</h1>
<p>The first thing they did on Jan 28th was removing the Contact page from their site entirely. And it's still missing lol, not a big surprise.</p>

<p>Isn't it interesting, guys? I tried to google any press releases about these guys leaving, but found nothing. Do you have any information about them leaving? </p>
<p>I mean Special Advisor to the CEO and a Global Treasurer disappearing from the homepage without any PR is sus AF, isn't it?</p>
<p>P.S. I also checked all the other pages side to side for the changes, but there were no significant changes made.</p>
<p>Edit 1: Holy smokes, thanks for the Platinum, kind stranger! My first Platinum ever.</p>
