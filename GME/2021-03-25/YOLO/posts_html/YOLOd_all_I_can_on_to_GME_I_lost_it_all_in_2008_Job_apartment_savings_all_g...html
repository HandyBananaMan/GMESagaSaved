<h1>Title: YOLO'd all I can on to GME. I lost it all in 2008. Job, apartment, savings all gone. Had to move back in with the parents at the time. I've spent 13 years building back, but 2020 put me deep in debt. I just want to set my kids up for a good future, and buy this DeLorean. Is that too much to ask?</h1>
