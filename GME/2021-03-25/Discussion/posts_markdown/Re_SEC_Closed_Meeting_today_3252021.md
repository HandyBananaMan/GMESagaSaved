So this is my first attempt at trying to add value to our beloved ape community.  I decided to see what I could find out about this closed meeting the SEC had on deck for today.  What I found is mostly above my head but it does sound to me that someone(s) about to get pinched?

[**https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events**](https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events)

**SEC Meeting noted here:**

[**https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events/closed-meeting-032521**](https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events/closed-meeting-032521)

From the above page I clicked on the “Sunshine Act Notice” link: [https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg032521.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg032521.htm)

In 3rd paragraph under **MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED:**

**“The General Counsel of the Commission, or his designee, has certified that, in his opinion, one or more of the exemptions set forth in** ***5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(3), (5), (6), (7), (8), 9(B) and (10) and 17 CFR 200.402(a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), (a)(9)(ii) and (a)(10)*****,** permit consideration of the scheduled matters at the closed meeting.”

# So I googled “5 U.S.C. 552b” and found this:

I'm out of my depth on this but it feels pertinent to marble ape brain.  I don't feel right tagging our most wrinkled of ape brains here until more of yall check it out and make sure I'm not wasting folks time.  I suppose it's all speculation regardless.Enjoy!

EDIT: as my ape fam correctly points out this may or MAY NOT have anything to do with GME. Confirmation bias led me to post. Maybe it’s our boys and maybe it ain’t.
