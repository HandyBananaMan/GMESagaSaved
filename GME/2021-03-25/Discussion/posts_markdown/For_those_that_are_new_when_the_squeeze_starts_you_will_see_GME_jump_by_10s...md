Seeing a 20% bump up in a couple of hours isn't a squeeze, it's purchase momentum.

When the squeeze actually starts to happen, you will see it jump $10s of dollars at a time, then $100s, then $1000s, etc.  It will give you goosebumps.  If not goosebumps, no squeeze.

Edit: there will also be circuit breaker halts as it skyrockets. This isn't manipulation, it's built into the market. Look it up so you don't panic or think it's manipulation.
