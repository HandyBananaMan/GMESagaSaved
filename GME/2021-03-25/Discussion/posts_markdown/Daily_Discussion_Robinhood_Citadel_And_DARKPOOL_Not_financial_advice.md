Hello, I‚Äôm korean ape. from South korea. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ (I'm not a financial advisor)

its awesome to meet you!

(I organized this opinion because I thought of the data related to ‚Äúdarkpool‚Äù that came out in the morning.)

\->   I heard that the morning data is about otc, not darkpool. This is just one hypothesis. 

(link: [https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/Agreement](https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/Agreement))

Before read, I can be not smart and not accurate.

It is just my ‚Äòopinion‚ÄôüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

To make it easier to see, I'll tell you by number in order.

1. Citadel is large size Market Maker about 50% of entire retail trading.

One of their functions as market makers is to 'OWN' the shares for the purpose of giving the shares to the buyer.

2. Robinhood is deeply related to Citadel. Robinhood has taken the profit via providing investment information to Citadel.

3. Robinhood and Citadel have found ways to maximize their profits : when an individual places the orders, they have issued an iou rather than an actual share -> And they took the stock from the clearinghouse during the sale process, but they shorted that shares Or lower down stock price with other short selling types during the process. -> As result, the stock price has gone down. Then Retail investors have decided to sell it. So Citadel is not necessary give shares back to Retail investors. - >(Or if incase Retail investors stayed in position, Citadel obtains the shares from Darkpool and deliver the actual shares to Retail investors.)

For example, if I bought one GME share with $100, Citadel shorted with retail investors' shares, to lower down the stock prices, Then get shares from Darkpool with cheap prices, So Citadel maximize the gain as much as their profit.

Using Retail investors' investment mind such as panic sell (Paperhands) to take their profit.

4. The usual Retail investors' closed their position when prices is going down. But in this GME case during the same process, ALL Apes Hold STRONG for GME.So Citadel was sucking up their messes so far at least from 2020 or prior, But from Jan 24th to the 25th 2021, a lot of orders came in at the same time. As we known, more than half of Robin Hood users have had One share of GME for more than a week.

5. Citadel could not take those orders, (Because they need time to get the stocks), so Robinhood have removed BUY BUTTON.And limited the number of buying shares (now it does make sesne to me why Robinhood only limited the most popular items of Retail investors at the time).

6. Ultimately, Citadel was not able to bring up all the orders as Market Maker while processing the ftd stocks up from $40 to $400 in January. It casues a slight increase associated with the ftd squeeze on February 24 (expected limit in Darkpool, so they should buy ‚ÄúGME‚Äù In real stock market).

7. If this my imaginations were right, I clearly can see what just happened to here. The U.S stock market could lose all credibility by HFS's in their taste and fuck the all Retail investors in this way, so now the dtcc and the Fed's reaction seems like trying cover up their ass from this situation.Buried in the Backyard all the fucking shitty things with short squeeze.

8. P.S, Citadel cannot do this shit for forever. there is a limit for them to this kind of rotation. So if they reached to limit, TO THE MOON.

Once again, this is not financial advice and my brain has no wrinkles. just my opinion.

bye and holdd

See you on the moon, apes!

good night :)  Tldr korean apes holing together
