Pretty weak on you if you ask me.

If you are engaging in the same behaviour you are no better than any shill or hedgefund. You are just as bad.

Do you know how you win? You buy and you hold. You keep your loose lips fucking shut. You keep your head down and do your job.

Otherwise you are losing.

There will be a time to laugh, there will be a time to gloat.

That time is not now.

Finish strong. Dont fall victim to their traps. Do not engage in shilly behaviour. Do not be an emotional wreck.

This is not advice of any kind, financial or otherwise. Just an observation and opinion from an ape who wants to see other apes beat the game.



*Edit: it seems some apes are truly smooth brained and missing the point.

Challenging fud and calling out lies is not only warranted, it is welcomed.

People are attacking and harassing others online and saying "im out for blood!" - this is the wrong way to go about anything. If this is you then yeah you should keep your mouth shut because you dont know how to operate.

Calling out FUD, challenging people on their stances and providing counter arguments? This is good. This is what you should be doing. 

Did I  miss anything?
