IT HELPS PROMOTE THE POST AND INSPIRE THIS APE!\n\nAny Journalism or Legal Writing Apes that feel compelled to lend a hand please DM me!\n\nHello Apes -\n\nI know that in the past, we've discussed briefly contacting media personalities to combat the narrative of the (bought) Main Stream Media.  I think this is an important angle we should explore.\n\nWhen I woke up, I read through the new DD and the posts from u/heyitspixel & u/rensole about the troll/shill campaign that seems to be threatening their lives.  At the very least, this is fucking with their heads, and I cannot stand by and let this happen without considering using the power we have in numbers to combat this fuckery.\n\nI propose this.  I've done some research on who might be best to contact regarding this whole situation.  They all have Twitter, and they all can be influenced publicly with a Twitter storm of messages.\n\nHere are some candidates that I believe are good targets (with some copy pasta profiles):\n\n**William D.

I suspect that if we can create a big enough list of potential journalists to tweet at with a significant amount of our DD and evidence that we can attract at least ONE suitor.

I don't care what media venue or personality we include in this storm.  The more eyes the better...**\n\n# What is my goal?\n\nExposure.  WHY?  Well, WIN LOSE OR DRAW in our mission to the moon, these fuckers need to have this shit outed.  People need to be engaged and NOT just us apes.  The plebs who are losing money with the hedgfunds through their pensions, the people who can't afford a fractional share of GME.\n\n# How do we proceed?\n\nWe compile all the best evidence from the wrinkle brain repository.

Adding a media outlet section we can spam for pressure.\n\nEDIT INFINITY:  Jesus H... I'll be doing this all day.
