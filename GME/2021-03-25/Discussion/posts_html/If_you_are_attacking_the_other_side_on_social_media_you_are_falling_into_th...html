<p>Pretty weak on you if you ask me.</p>
<p>If you are engaging in the same behaviour you are no better than any shill or hedgefund. You are just as bad.</p>
<p>Do you know how you win? You buy and you hold. You keep your loose lips fucking shut. You keep your head down and do your job.</p>
<p>Otherwise you are losing.</p>
<p>There will be a time to laugh, there will be a time to gloat.</p>
<p>That time is not now.</p>
<p>Finish strong. Dont fall victim to their traps. Do not engage in shilly behaviour. Do not be an emotional wreck.</p>
<p>This is not advice of any kind, financial or otherwise. Just an observation and opinion from an ape who wants to see other apes beat the game.</p>
<p>*Edit: it seems some apes are truly smooth brained and missing the point.</p>
<p>Challenging fud and calling out lies is not only warranted, it is welcomed.</p>
<p>People are attacking and harassing others online and saying "im out for blood!" - this is the wrong way to go about anything. If this is you then yeah you should keep your mouth shut because you dont know how to operate.</p>
<p>Calling out FUD, challenging people on their stances and providing counter arguments? This is good. This is what you should be doing. </p>
<p>Did I  miss anything?</p>
