<p>Seeing a 20% bump up in a couple of hours isn't a squeeze, it's purchase momentum.</p>
<p>When the squeeze actually starts to happen, you will see it jump $10s of dollars at a time, then $100s, then $1000s, etc.  It will give you goosebumps.  If not goosebumps, no squeeze.</p>
<p>Edit: there will also be circuit breaker halts as it skyrockets. This isn't manipulation, it's built into the market. Look it up so you don't panic or think it's manipulation.</p>
