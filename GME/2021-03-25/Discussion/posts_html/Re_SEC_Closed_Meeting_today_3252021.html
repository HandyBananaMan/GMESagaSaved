<p>So this is my first attempt at trying to add value to our beloved ape community.  I decided to see what I could find out about this closed meeting the SEC had on deck for today.  What I found is mostly above my head but it does sound to me that someone(s) about to get pinched?</p>

<p><strong>SEC Meeting noted here:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events/closed-meeting-032521"><strong>https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events/closed-meeting-032521</strong></a></p>
<p>From the above page I clicked on the “Sunshine Act Notice” link: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg032521.htm">https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg032521.htm</a></p>
<p>In 3rd paragraph under <strong>MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The General Counsel of the Commission, or his designee, has certified that, in his opinion, one or more of the exemptions set forth in</strong> <strong><em>5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(3), (5), (6), (7), (8), 9(B) and (10) and 17 CFR 200.402(a)(3), (a)(5), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), (a)(9)(ii) and (a)(10)</em></strong><strong>,</strong> permit consideration of the scheduled matters at the closed meeting.”</p>
