It is just ridiculous how GME drops 10% and simply every news talks about how the fcking stock is crashing. 

However, when it shoots **up 35%** in a couple of hours, there is not even **a single motherfcker** writing about it. 

Man, it just proves how fcked up it all is... how fcked up media is...

Hodling to the fckng moon you motherfckers  ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€
