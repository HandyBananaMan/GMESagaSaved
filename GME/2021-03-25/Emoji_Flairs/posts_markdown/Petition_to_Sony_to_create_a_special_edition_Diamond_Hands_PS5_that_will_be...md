#Title: Petition to Sony to create a special edition Diamond Hands PS5 that will be exclusively available only at GAME STOP. I suggest we open up a design contest and vote, the winning design would be produced by Sony. GME would price this special edition console at 3x the regular price. Thoughts?

EDIT 1: On a second thought, we agreed that we should not single out PS ONLY because apes donâ€™t discriminate. ALL platforms welcome! PS, XBOX AND PC
