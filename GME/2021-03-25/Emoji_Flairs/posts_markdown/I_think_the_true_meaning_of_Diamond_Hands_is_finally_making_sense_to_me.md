I am a Canadian millennial ape nurse holding less than 6 shares since the end of January. Before January 27th, 2021, I knew NOTHING of investing, the stock market etc., my knowledge only encompassed creating a tight budget with which to organize my piddly little nursing wage. Until GameStop...

I happened across it on the r/all page one day, read the post, and did NOT understand a single word but it seemed important... I had that gut feeling. So, I started reading r/wallstreetbets and eventually r/gme. In the past 2 months I have learned SO MUCH. The learning curve is huge and it is difficult to climb. I spend every day reading through all the GME posts and diving into the basics of investing through other sources.

As of yesterday, I was finally able to understand what an ETF IS because some wrinkle-brained ape used Yu-Gi-Oh cards as an analogy. Another poster was kind enough to explain short interest in terms of WoW DoTs.

Something changed this morning when I was greeted with Pixel's disturbing situation. I got angry and upset. I've been here with everyone but I wasn't really in it if that makes sense. I didn't truly realize the gravity of the situation until today.

I am here with my single digit shares. I am DIAMOND HANDS! They need ALL our shares!

Edit: The Yu-Gi-OH ETF was actually a comment, and I was able to find it! Here is the original comment :
