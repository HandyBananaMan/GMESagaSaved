<p>It is just ridiculous how GME drops 10% and simply every news talks about how the fcking stock is crashing. </p>
<p>However, when it shoots <strong>up 35%</strong> in a couple of hours, there is not even <strong>a single motherfcker</strong> writing about it. </p>
<p>Man, it just proves how fcked up it all is... how fcked up media is...</p>
<p>Hodling to the fckng moon you motherfckers  ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€</p>
