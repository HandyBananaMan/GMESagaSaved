Investing in Chewy had made a lot of careers, and I\u2019m proud of that.

I relished the challenges of disrupting an entire industry and trying to delight customers to a degree that had never been achieved before. The excitement I felt from putting together a world-class team of employees and investors, succeeding against all odds, and building a multibillion-dollar retail leader from nothing was unequivocally the greatest of my career.\"**\n\n# [Ryan Cohen](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale)\n\n[https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwho in their right mind would bet against *this man*?!\n\nit's a pleasure following you to the moon, Sir.\n\n&#x200B;",
