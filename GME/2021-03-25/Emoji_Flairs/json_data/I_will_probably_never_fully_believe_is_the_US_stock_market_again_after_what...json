    "selftext": "International ape here holding strong. Bought before the RH fuckery, watched the price get manipulated the fuck down to $40. Didnt sell at 80% loss. Watched it go back up to $350, didnt sell. Warching the same fuckery driving down the price again, I WONT FUCKING SELL.\n\nBut to watch this goes completely unpunished by all the authorities that should be responsible for not allowing this to happen has given me a grim perspective on where the US stands as a safe market.\n\nIf this can happen to GME when all the eyes are on it, imagine what can be done to other stocks that dont have a these apes holding forever?  \n\nI wont sell until this $3M/share but i will probably take my money somewhere less prone to the blatant manipulation in broad day light.\n\nRant out. HODL you beautiful apes! \ud83d\udd90\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80",
