    "selftext": "Holding strong with pixel. I can\u2019t sell now and neither should you. This is more than just about stock or a share price now. This is your livelihood under a corrupt system. You\u2019re not holding for just money, holding is fighting for your freedom and we\u2019re all here holding with you from around the globe. Hold fast apes.\nI\u2019ll sell once we win this battle and citadel and fucks are liquidated. These fucks forget that we outnumber them 1000000:1. They can act like kings but even kings bleed. \n\n\"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win\u201d\n\nThe game has changed. This isn\u2019t about dd anymore. Anyone of us could be in pixels position right now but he isn\u2019t alone and we\u2019re all there with him and for each other. The stock may have been what led us here but the reason we\u2019re all holding is for a deeper and more profound reason. For our independence and for a better tomorrow. Knowing that, I can\u2019t sell in good faith until these monsters are properly done with and erased and I know everyone here feels that deeply. \nFrom their fuckery in 2008 and fucking over everyone and collapsing the economy till now, we may never have another chance at destroying corruption with the leverage we have now. We hold fast and hold strong.\n\nThe DD was right all along, this truly is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I\u2019m glad to be here with everyone of you in this fight right now. There\u2019s no where else that I\u2019d rather be and there\u2019s a reason we\u2019re here in this moment in time. It\u2019s bigger than all of us. It\u2019s the whole world. People from everywhere trying for a better tomorrow for their family and friends. \nWe\u2019re making history, holding fast.\n\n\nThreats on pixels life: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mctnn7/the_psychological_warfare_is_in_the_end_phase_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",
