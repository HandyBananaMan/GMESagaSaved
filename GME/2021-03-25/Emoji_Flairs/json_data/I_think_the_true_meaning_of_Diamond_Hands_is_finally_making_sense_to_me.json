    "selftext": "I am a Canadian millennial ape nurse holding less than 6 shares since the end of January. Before January 27th, 2021, I knew NOTHING of investing, the stock market etc., my knowledge only encompassed creating a tight budget with which to organize my piddly little nursing wage. Until GameStop...\n\nI happened across it on the r/all page one day, read the post, and did NOT understand a single word but it seemed important... I had that gut feeling. So, I started reading r/wallstreetbets and eventually r/gme. In the past 2 months I have learned SO MUCH. The learning curve is huge and it is difficult to climb. I spend every day reading through all the GME posts and diving into the basics of investing through other sources.\n\nAs of yesterday, I was finally able to understand what an ETF IS because some wrinkle-brained ape used Yu-Gi-Oh cards as an analogy. Another poster was kind enough to explain short interest in terms of WoW DoTs.\n\nSomething changed this morning when I was greeted with Pixel's disturbing situation. I got angry and upset. I've been here with everyone but I wasn't really in it if that makes sense. I didn't truly realize the gravity of the situation until today.\n\nI am here with my single digit shares. I am DIAMOND HANDS! They need ALL our shares!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83c\udffd\n\nEdit: The Yu-Gi-OH ETF was actually a comment, and I was able to find it! Here is the original comment :\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbu916/not\\_my\\_post\\_but\\_it\\_is\\_being\\_downvoted\\_like\\_crazy/gs05qbt/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbu916/not_my_post_but_it_is_being_downvoted_like_crazy/gs05qbt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",
