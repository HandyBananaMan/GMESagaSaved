    "selftext": "I have never been more disillusioned than in this moment. This entire fucking country is a ponzi scheme for the rich. Its like waking up from the matrix, I'm beyond pissed. I'm not spending the rest of my life working for a fraudulent system meant to exploit me. Fuck all of this. I'm hopping on the first flight out of this shit hole. No wonder you have an entire generation of people depressed and suicidal. This shit is ridiculous.\n\nEdit: Thank you Apes from the bottom of my heart. I will hold until the DTCC and every bank & broker in America implodes. If we all aren't millionaire's by the end of this, I will hold these shares in the afterlife. If this is what it takes to stop the corruption and lies, so be it. Burn it all down.",
