<p>I was talking to my girlfriend this morning about buying the beautiful cheesy dip of GME tendies this morning. My problem is that our anniversary is coming up next weekend and I want to do something extra special for her and us fancy dinner, jewelery, vacation, etc.</p>
<p>Well she mentioned this morning if I wanted to buy GME and postpone our dinner/gifts to buy some more GME I CAN.</p>
<p>YOU KNOW DAMM WELL I DID AND I WILL MARRY MY BEAUTIFUL SOUL MATE.</p>
<p>TO THE MOON FELLOW APES!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍♥❤❤💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🙌</p>
<p>edit: To all my fellow apes telling me to still get her something or it's a test, no worries my fellow smooth brains, making/made a couple super sentimental things and I will have flowers!   <br />
LOVE YOU ALL AND HODL!!!</p>
