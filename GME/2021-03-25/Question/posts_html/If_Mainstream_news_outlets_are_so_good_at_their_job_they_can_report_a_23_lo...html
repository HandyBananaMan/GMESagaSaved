<p>I'm just asking questions guys.</p>
<p>Edit 1, 2:53pm EDT: it is now up 43%. See? It's not hard to do news, just update with an edit and time stamp so that people can see that your presentation of information is transparent and they can form their own opinion. </p>
<p>As for me, I like the stock.</p>
<p>Edit 2, 5:03pm EDT: Some responses are giving valid statements that MSM outlets are reporting gains articles. I want to bring attention to one of my replies that I'll summarize here. </p>
<p>True enough, there are articles reporting gains when you google them, but look at the time postings. 3:28pm with updates at 4:30pm well after markets close and at a time when the majority of retail investors can't act on the news. Contrast this with negative news published yesterday immediately before the dip at 11am when there are still 4 hours for the market to respond to the news and while there may be good reasons for this, it seems suspicious. </p>
<p>As for me, I've never liked the stock more than I do now.</p>
