    "selftext": "Originally posted by: u/HomoChef \n\n\n\u201cCitadel is throttling buy orders and manipulating the stock downwards\n\nSome new DD was posted recently from r/atobitt and r/tearsaresweat, linked below to their posts:\n\n[525 Million GME shares traded OTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcfq4e/shitadel_other_hedgies_are_trading_over_525/)\n\n[Citadel paying for order flow from 9 online brokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mbvplb/huge_citadel_is_paying_for_order_flow_from_nine/)\n\nAnd I just wanted to link it together for the masses to really ruminate and understand the impact of the Darkpool accumulation of shares (which will likely Fail-to-Deliver \"FTD\" - ie., counterfeit) that Citadel has been doing.\n\nThis ELIA was posted by JOELO (I'm directly copy-pasting, because he explained it so digestibly) in the DFV discord.\n\n\u201cSo say citadel has 100,000 shares of GME in stock. They pay for order flow from a dozen public traders who route buys and sells of GME through them. If they can fulfill these trades with their personal stock, they do not need to go to public 'lit' markets like the NYSE to get shares. So lets say 5000 people buy 100 GME through them and 5000 people sell 100 GME through them. They can choose to fill the 50000 buys with their 100000 stock and then put the 50000 sells through to the NYSE so the public market only sees the sells and there is only downward pressure on the market\"\n\nExcept in this case, we're talking about 525 million shares. And they are surely counterfeit/shorted stock, as again, only about 70 million $GME Class A Common Shares are currently in existence, which was re-confirmed in the GME 10-K SEC filing yesterday.\n\nSo we're talking about a major market maker who is paying for order flow, accumulating (or fabricating) FTD shares, and then using those fake shares to fulfill the orders of traders on the buy-side, while placing sell-side orders on the NYSE. The buying pressure would not impact the price because it's fulfilled without placing a bid on the market, whereas the selling pressure would make a bigger impact on the market (and thus, the ticker price).\n\nThis explains how they've been able to make such a huge impact on the market price, despite having more buying volume than selling volume. It also explains how they've been able to short on the downticks even with SSR protection.\n\nI'm not 100% sure about the SEC definition of Market Manipulation, but this sounds criminal to me. Maybe someone much smarter than I can chip in with what can be done to counteract this bullshit.\n\nNow, I'm not sure what the impact of VIRTU Americas and G1 Execution Services are, but it can be assumed they are in cahoots or complicit in, essentially, naked short selling the stock to manipulate the share price of $GME. Further, these may be partners in crime in order to pass-the-buck on FTD timelines. Ex., when an FTD starts to hit that 13-day mark, it gets passed onto a complicit or cooperating entity.\n\nTL;DR - the price you're seeing is hugely manipulated, and this is the nuts-and-bolts of how they are manipulating it.\n\nFeel free to X-post to r/GME, as they've banned me for some reason without giving me any explanation why.\n\n\nEDIT 1 - It also explains why the EUROpoor markets have been much better able to sustain upward momentum, stabilize/consolidate the stock, and have more consistent impact on the buy-side - BECAUSE CITADEL ISN'T FRONT-RUNNING THE STOCK'S FULFILLMENT TO IMPACT THE PRICE. They use other (presumably non-compromised) brokers/platforms.\u201d",
