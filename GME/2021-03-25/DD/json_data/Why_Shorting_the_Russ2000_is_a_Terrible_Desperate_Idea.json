    "selftext": "If people are actually shorting IWM up to 35% just to get to GME things are about to get crazy.\n\nFew things first, let me explain the major indices for those who aren't aware.  The 3 major ones I follow are Nasdaq (QQQ), S and P 500 (SPY), and Russ2000 (IWM).  (Parentheses indicate the major ETF or SPDR for the respective index)\n\nQQQ follows tech companies, with large holding of things like AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, etc...  This is the one getting all the hype during the rally of 2020.\n\nIWM contains 2000 smaller cap companies in sectors like Healthcare, Financials, Cyclicals.  Most importantly, Gamestop has moved into the top holdings as a result of recent price action.\n\nSPY is the one people like to YOLO their savings on with FDs.  It is essentially an average of QQQ and IWM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Why shorting large ETFs, in general, is a bad idea.\n\nIWM is one of the largest, most well known ETFs out there. ETFs generally don't move that much: they are safe plays and big money wants everyone to know it.  HFs go in and make large plays on both sides of these ETFs, taking advantage of people not really managing their investments and come out on top whether it goes up or down.  Now, imagine you're Bridgewater and some small-time HF (Citadel's AUM is peanuts compared to the their's) comes in and desperately shorts IWM.  Well now its starting to affect your positions in SPY.  Sure your puts might do well, but you also want your calls to make bank after you offload your puts.  Also btw 10% of your portfolio is SPY shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Citadel Positions from 13F: they play both sides to maximize profits](https://preview.redd.it/8z0wkqvr08p61.png?width=1855&format=png&auto=webp&s=797d01b9b35a77e20044852ef5c885468e4e69a8)\n\nThe people shorting IWM right now: their hand is out for everyone to see and they're minnows compared to the true money movers and I haven't even included banks yet.  This only ends two ways:\n\na) Citadel/Point72 and co get skullfucked because they have zero (relative) financial leverage and they can no longer play both sides of the trade which is the HF main advantage.\n\nb) Everyone jumps on board and decides to crash the market??? I'm not buying it...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Why shorting IWM, right now, is an especially horrible idea\n\nThis is more anecdotal, but seems to be a sentiment among the investing community (at least what people talk about in Clubhouse rooms lmao).  People want to rotate into recovery stocks right now.  Tech had a huge run but many of the retail boys have yet to reach the pre-corona highs (Macy's, Cinemark, Kimball, etc...  -> BTW NOT TELLING YOU TO INVEST IN THESE BY ANY MEANS).  But people like their buzzwords like \"Sector Rotation\" or some dumb shit like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Russ 2000 Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/j5gkyo8u28p61.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ead59254b92db6c4f03fa9c1802f91b6e787281)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[QQQ Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/shem9n1x28p61.png?width=1535&format=png&auto=webp&s=254e198fc676adecffbfb7333e6f8c66bbe52509)\n\nAs you can see in the charts, IWM trailed QQQ during most of 2020.  Tech hype was so high that people were just blindly throwing cash at it and it soared.  However, during the last month or so of 2020 into this year IWM has caught up in terms of percentage gains from the pre-corona highs.  In fact, if not for the recent sell-off from the shorting, it would have easily surpassed the Q's.  People are hungry for the recovery plays and vaccines start to roll out and that means success for IWM.  Big money, again, doesn't want their positions fucked because some idiot forgot to do the math on how long the GME dildo is.\n\nThe shorts are a kite in a hurricane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Why trying to short GME through IWM has a reduced effect\n\nIt is well known that shorting through an ETF means you only short a small percentage of each underlying asset.  Right now GME makes up about 0.4-0.5% of IWM I believe.  They have to short 200 shares of IWM just to get one share of GME.  Additionally, if they want to buy the other components of IWM to reduce the short exposure this will cost them a lot.  If they don't buy the other components they will be at huge risk to any upward movement in IWM, meaning they lose money not just from GME, but also everything else in Russ 2000.  Its a signal of desperation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne caveat to all this: some people are saying stocks are overinflated in general and that we are due for a massive correction.  While this may be true, the powers that be certainly don't care and really their opinion is the only one that matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: If Citadel/Point72/Susquehanna really are shorting GME through IWM they are now gonna bring in the real makers of the stock market and they're not gonna be fucking happy about it.  The belt will come out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: took me a while to write this but it looks like both GME and IWM are on the bounce today.  This lead me to believe that the GME shorts didn't cover their new IWM shorts with long exposure and are in the shit even more now.\n\nEdit 2: Commented said the title is a bit inaccurate: it should really say IWM instead of Russ2000\n\nEdit 3: Edited holdings of GME by IWM\n\nEdit 4: Clarified index\u2019s vs etf symbols, Also thanks for 5k and getting this in god tier dd!",
