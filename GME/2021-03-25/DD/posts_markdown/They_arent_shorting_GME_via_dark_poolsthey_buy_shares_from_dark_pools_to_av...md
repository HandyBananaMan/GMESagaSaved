"It's likely that all the ETF rebalancing allowed them to extract all those gme shares which were then sold to the shorts in dark pool transactions. i would wager thats  where they got a lot of the ammo for today's attack. 

No matter, it was just another desperate stall tactic..shorts will be forced to cover soon enough!
