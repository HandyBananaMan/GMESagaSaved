\*\*\*EDIT 16\*\*\* Lots of comments and DMs.  I'll try to get to everyone.  I am no expert.  I just guessed right (so far).  But as we know in this ongoing GME saga, anything could happen tomorrow.  So far, the momentum has carried into AH.  We'll know a lot more pre-market.

\---

Not investment advice.  Not legal advice.  Not mental health advice.  Do your own due diligence.  Make your own decisions.  This is just speculation.

So far today (~~2:48pm EST~~ ~~3:03PM EST 3:17PM EST~~ 3:33PM EST), there have been ~~206.83k~~ ~~214.43K~~ ~~238.49K 250.0K~~ 266.33K calls purchased versus ~~173.48k~~ ~~180.96k~~ ~~196.02K~~ ~~204.27K~~ 212.55K puts purchased (a put/call ratio of ~~0.843~~ ~~0.822~~ ~~0.815~~ 0.798) \[edit8: which means the disparity gap of calls over puts is still getting larger by the minute\].  The volume was similar yesterday.   I am hoping most of these calls were purchased deep in the money (like I did yesterday as explained here: [I Bought Deep In-The-Money Calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mciozx/i_didnt_merely_buy_more_shares_today_i_bought/)).  3/26 $150c this morning opened at $2.60 and have been as high as $34.72.  I picked up a few more this morning.  MMs are certainly going to have to delta hedge those calls given the price action this week.  Besides the long side day-traders profit taking and ongoing short attacks (a 10% intra-day pullback from daily high is completely natural as the stock runs higher), we are on target to close above $175 (or at least get there AH).  If and when that happens, there will be an immense amount of delta hedging by the MMs since the stock was hovering in the $110s last night.  Although a gamma squeeze was unlikely when the stock was trading in the $200s (especially given the extremely high premiums), the shorts attack on the stock gave us an opportunity to load up on deeply discounted call options.  This is what happens when you artificially crash a price where market sentiment is the mirror opposite and without a negative catalyst.  That quick of a price drop absent a negative catalyst, and 9 times out of 10 you'll see a snap back to the VWAP.  Oh, and don't forget the day-trade short sellers who are going to have to buy out their short positions since they will not want to hold them overnight.  This thing could rocket into the $200s before week end.  If you look back at the VW chart, there was a big dip before the big squeeze.....

TL/DR: I'm not saying it will happen; but it is certainly a possibility.  And a 25-50% spike due to a gamma squeeze could trigger the *actual* squeeze.

\*\*\*EDIT 1\*\*\* Typos

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\* I'll update the numbers and/or repost this once market closes to give the actual number of options volume contracts purchased and the ratio.

\*\*\*EDIT 3\*\*\* Updated figures.  A key is that the call volume outweighs the put volume (the put/call ratio is 0.842).  When the option activity is lopsided, MMs have to hedge long or short (depending on which whether the call or put volume is getting the bigger attention).

\*\*\*EDIT 4\*\*\* The $175C options are now in the money...  And, as updated above, the put/call ratio is increasing (now it is 0.815).

\*\*\*EDIT 5\*\*\* (3:08 PM EST) As per the typical playbook, here comes the day-trade short sellers doubling down in panic to try to reverse the momentum.  Volume is too high.  It won't work.  (IMHO)

\*\*\*EDIT 6\*\*\* (3:15 PM EST) The drop in the RSI from 70ish to 60ish shows the shorts are putting downward pressure.  But its weak pressure (moreso panicking day-traders on short side than coordinated HFs on the short side).  Updated figures above,  the put/call ratio keeps getting larger (i.e., more disparity of calls over puts).

\*\*\*EDIT 7\*\*\* (3:20 PM EST) Although the RSI dropped (indicating downward pressure on the price), the short-term MAC-D is still 1 point above the signal line, which indicates the momentum is still bullish (and the downward pressure on price is artificial and not reflective of true market sentiment).  You can just feel the tension building....

\*\*\*EDIT 8\*\*\* (3:28 PM EST) I've gotten some DMs about why I picked up the call options yesterday.  I explained my thoughts a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mciozx/i_didnt_merely_buy_more_shares_today_i_bought/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcea8r/thoughts_on_todays_manufactured_price_action/).  We still need follow-through volume from the bulls tomorrow for the price to hold.  But by overattacking the stock (a stock that some people with big money want to see go up), they overdid it.  The stock behaved so abnormally to traditional technical analysis and indicators that I thought a bull run today would be a big possibility.  I just got the sense that a lot of people were hovering over the "buy" button waiting for the bottom.  A lot can still happen. Nothing is guaranteed.  I am just saying the *possibility* is there to follow the gamma squeezes in January and February.  If it does gamma squeeze, is this something that is going to start happening once a month?  Guess we will find out.  (Also, updated figures above.  The put/call ratio difference keeps growing).

~~\*\*\*EDIT 9\*\*\* (3:42 PM EST)~~ \*\*\*EDIT 14\*\*\*  Apologies to u/Whiskiz, but I am removing the link to the VW short squeeze based on some of the comments I have received.  I definitely do not want anyone to misinterpret anything I say or create false hope or expectation.  This is really a completely different situation, and a first of its kind.  I don't want anyone to misinterpret the VW chart as saying that is what I believe will happen here--it is unprecedented so the price action will be as well.  Link removed.

\*\*\*EDIT 10\*\*\* (3:51 PM EDT).  As u/Kourafas pointed out, it is "EDT"  not "EST".  Fixed.  I'll update the call/put volume on market close.  In response to u/SquierrellyDave this is actual call/put volume. The data is courtesy of [www.trade-ideas.com](https://www.trade-ideas.com).   Also, I am not promising a date.  I am not promising a gamma squeeze.  I am not promising the price will go anywhere.  I've only been day trading for about a year.  I have a lot to learn.  Certainly not claiming to be an expert.

\*\*\*EDIT 11\*\*\* (4:01 PM EDT).  Updated with new numbers.  **Final numbers:  Call volume of 294.18K vs. put volume of 230.97K (a put/call ratio of 0.785).**  I'll need to dig (perhaps someone can help) to find out how many of the calls are in the money, almost in-the-money, or lotto tickets (e.g., $800).  The reason I think this is ripe for a gamma squeeze (which is NOT a short squeeze) is because the price was $115 this morning.  At that price, the $150,  $175 and $200 calls were way out of the money.  The further out of the money the calls are, the less likely the price will reach the strike price.  The less likely the price will reach the strike price, the less shares MMs need to purchase to hedge.  A gamma squeeze (which I believe is what caused the spikes in January and February) was not a possibility until the HFs over-attacked the price yesterday.

\*\*\*EDIT 12\*\*\* I was going to post this in a comment but adding an edit here for everyone.  This is in response to u/Idjek's question.

So a call/put option is a contract.  The contract gives you the right (but not the obligation) to purchase (call) or sell (put) shares at the strike price.  Most people who have in-the-money call options (which means the market price is higher than the strike price \[further simplified you are making money on the option\]) will sell them for a profit, or if they expire without being exercised they will be compensated at fair market value if the option holder does not have the cash on hand for it to be exercised.

A call option is the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price.  So if I purchased 3 $150 call options that expire tomorrow, that means even if the stock price is at $250, I have the right to purchase 300 shares at a price of $150.  That's still a big nut ($45K) which most people cannot afford.  Even if no one holding an in-the-money (profitable) call option executes the option tomorrow, the market makers still need to have enough stock on hand to deliver it just in case someone (or multiple people) does executes the option (contractual right) to purchase the stock at the strike price.

The theory behind a gamma squeeze is, when enough people load up on call options, the market makers have to acquire shares for the possibility that the call options are both in-the-money (profitable) and exercised (the holder exercises the option to purchase the 100 shares).

The other key is the disproportionate number of calls to puts.  If there are an even number of calls and puts, then the option activity itself is hedged (so the brokers and MMS are risk-neutral on the options).  Think of it like sports betting.  If heavy betting is coming in on one side, Vegas moves the odds to encourage betting on the other side and even-out the activity.  Rather than "move the odds line", the MMs have to buy/sell shares to be risk-neutral on the options activity.

The market makers usually buy and sell shares slowly throughout the day to keep up with the options volume--so they are hedging real-time and it doesn't really effect the stock price.  When there is a sudden heavy surge of call volume + a huge swing in the price upwards, that unexpected movement causes a sudden need for the MMs to acquire an abnormally larger number of shares.  If they did not already have them on hand, they need to acquire them to stay risk-neutral.   How many shares they buy/sell is probably all done by computers and algo formulas.

On a basic level, everyone would lose faith in the market if someone tried to exercise an in-the-money call option and the broker said: "sorry, no shares available" or "sorry, I don't have them."  The brokers MUST be in a position to deliver the shares (via the Market Makers) if a call option is exercised.

\*\*\*EDIT 13\*\*\* I've gotten a few comments about my analysis, etc.  This is all just a hunch based on experience and studying.  This is definately a rigged game, we all know that.  But studying and learning has helped me try to make money by tailing the whales.

Here are a few books that I highly, highly recommend:

(1) "*A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis*" by Anna Couling \[she explains the importance of volume and how it never lies.  Back in the days of pit traders, the traders use to "sense" the markets shifting and could coat-tail the shift to make money.  At the time they, had a number of words for it...but what they were really sensing was volume."\]

(2) "*The Ultimate Price Action Trading Guide*" by Mangi Madang

(3) "*Trading In the Zone*" by Mark Douglas

There are also tons of videos online from people that know what they are doing.  You have to watch and study price action.  There is no shortcut to it.  I certainly am no expert.  But by studying charts and price action, it has helped me TIME my trades better, look to trade at support/resistance levels, wait for the volume to confirm a break-out, etc.

\*\*\*EDIT 15\*\*\* My data is based on the call volume (per trade-ideas, which is a stock screening platform I use).  I don't know what portion of the call volume is people (like me) who bought and are holding call options, or people who flipped them as the price went up.  Thanks to u/87CSD, here is some data on the actual option contract activity.

According to this page: [https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/](https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/)

March 26:

ITM calls = 14,418

OTM calls = 80,541

ITM puts = 6,879

OTM puts = 139,575

\*\*\*EDIT 17\*\*\* Courtesy of u/manifestingmoola2020, here is some additional information about today's options activity.  More info is always a good thing.

I was hoping this info would be useful. I dont think its all options activity based on your call/put ratio, but if you find this useful please feel free to share. This data is from a monthly chat service i pay for and i dont know how its accumulated.

Option flow data from today is as follows:

\*\*\*EDIT 18\*\*\* (3-26-201, 12:38 PM EDT)   Although I thought yesterday the conditions were ripe for a gamma squeeze, as I said, we needed bull momentum to continue into today. So the landscape--for now--has changed. Looks to me like $190 is where we consolidate, but I think we break out back up to the $200s soon. I still think we have a good chance to close above $225.  But the shorts will continue to attack at key support and resistance points to try to trigger panic and algo selling.  Since volume is low right now, we may be in for another short attack to try to break trend.
