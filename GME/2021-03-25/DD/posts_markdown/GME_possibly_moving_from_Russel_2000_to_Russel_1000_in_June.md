Due to GME's current market cap / stock price, GME is very likely to be eligible to join the Russel 1000 in June.

This Index/ETF is the bigger brother of the Russel 2000 and GME joining it will likely be a great thing.

***Long Winded Tesla Example:*** *Tesla joined the S&P 500 (SPY) last year. This is a great example of an MM attacked company and HF overshorted company that defied all expectations and joined a bigger index...*

# What happened when Tesla joined the S&P5OO

**How does S&P500 (SPY) work?**

* The usual buyers of the SPY which are usually retirement funds and other easy money/passive investors. When they buy 1 share of SPY, they're basically buying a small percentage of all 500 stocks in that index. The SPY doesn't track all 500 shares equally, some have more weight or more of an effect towards the SPY's final price.

**What happened to TSLA's price before it joined the SPY?**

* Right before Tesla joined the SPY last year, the 'market' which is basically us and those clever sneaky Wall Street people knew this was happening and they knew it beforehand. So what they did was that they drove Tesla's price up by loading up on tons of shares because they knew Tesla joining the SPY was only going to drive the price even higher.
* They drove the price to something like $510 and waited up to 2-4 weeks for the addition of Tesla into the SPY. Once it was added, only a couple of weeks later did we start seeing the price starting to slowly launch upwards slowly slowly into the 600's 700's 800's and just barely at $900.

**MIND YOU** that Tesla also did a stock split BEFORE entering the SPY. **Why?**

I don't know the facts and this is going to be speculation on my part. They simply did a forward split in order to create more float hence to make the stock price less volatile as we all remember how volatile it was pre-split... (Was sometimes moving by hundreds of dollars per day).

Because if you're part of an index like the SPY, you can't be volatile like that, you got to be like AAPL or MSFT or AMD slow moving and predictable... like a snail.

# GME possibly (likely) entering the Russel 1000

I think the following information should tickle you just right because it's pieces of a puzzle coming together to form something, you can almost tell what it is...

# #1

The Russel 1000 starts to rank all eligible US equities (stonks) to find new candidates to join it's index. It does this on **May 7.**

https://preview.redd.it/fy0llcnmy8p61.png?width=1923&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b8745debdd745cc979bb968effb8851515dad5b

# #2

The annual GME stockholder meeting, as screenshotted from the sec [10k filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-21-000032/). Date is \~June 10. May not be exactly **June 10**, but will likely be AROUND that time give or take a few days.

[GME stockholder meeting. June 10, we all know this.](https://preview.redd.it/mxos0jztx8p61.png?width=2477&format=png&auto=webp&s=99d5e4b9f94951029b4baf9cf3d6fdf7ab7e768e)

This day could be a red day as the kick out a bunch of boomers out of their board, the MM spin this negatively and do a fake attack to drop the price as usual. Also GME likely HAS to to pay these 'people' big bonuses for them to leave (willingly) so that will be a small but acceptable price to pay which again could take us in red territory.

# #3

But here's the kicker... The Russel 1000 Index re-constitutes (new better stocks replace old ones) itself on **June 25**

https://preview.redd.it/dx622fd2z8p61.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=16745e2eb3f627f46921df7320fb3bc0c635350b

**TLDR for this section:**

1. **April 12** GME shares recalled 60 days before the stockholder meeting.
2. **May 7** they'll talk internally and likely pick GME as a Russel 1000 candidate.
3. **June 4** Russel people might tell everyone some names joining the Russel 1000
4. \~**June 10** GME has it's stockholder meeting.
5. **June 11, 18 and 25** Russel people will tell everyone who's joining the Russel 1000
6. **June 28** Russel 1000 reconstitution is complete. GME is **maybe** part of the Russel 1000

# Possibility-craft (Likely to happen)

The 'Market' will want to price in GME's move to the Russel 1000 before it joins, could be up to 4 weeks maybe more when they start to do this. This happened with Tesla and other companies (though Tesla is the most vivid example i'm aware of)

&#x200B;

**Pricing GME into the Russel 1000 BEFORE IT JOINS:**

The 'market' (again us and the stock manipulators), love to price things in before they do something. They're 100% in my mind going to do with GME.

The 'market's' version of pricing in GME's move into the Russel 1000 BEFORE it even joins could be a future where HF and MM's will be beating the proverbial goat to death with more attacks and "gMe BaCk DoWn To 10 fAsT!!!1!1". It could also be glorious!1!1

&#x200B;

**Tendie town after GME joins the Russel 1000 & HF trickery to watch out for**

GME might start going up (or down) as soon as June 28. Don't forget what you read with the Tesla example at the start of this thread. Even after they joined, it took several weeks for the joining effects to become visible.

I don't know why, but this is what happened. It's in your best interest to expect it to happen with GME as well as a psychological war type of thing by god knows who to make you think the Russel 1000 join did nothing when in fact it's HF trickery again...

# Theorycrafting (Less likely to happen)

I'm going to line up a bunch of events for you, and you decide whether these are a series of coincidences or whether these are setup like dominoes.

1. **March 13:** Was to be the GME earnings date but was moved up. (**WHY?!!?**)
2. **March 22:** XRT rebalance COMPLETE date.
3. **March 23:** New actual GME earnings date
4. **March 25:** IWM dividend paid. GME shares dumped.
5. **April 12:** GME shares recalled 60 days before the stockholder meeting.
6. **April 16:** Expiry of DFV's 500 x $12c option contracts
7. **May 7:** They'll talk internally and likely pick GME as a Russel 1000 candidate.
8. **June 4:** Russel people might tell everyone some names joining the Russel 1000
9. **June 10:** GME has it's stockholder meeting.
10. **June 11, 18 and 25:** Russel people will tell everyone who's joining the Russel 1000
11. **June 28:** Russel 1000 reconstitution is complete. GME is maybe part of the Russel 1000
12. **June 29:** All Russel Indexes are rebalanced and reconstituted.

Look at these events, how they're lined up. Look at them and find the patterns. Please comment about what you see as my brain is just on the verge of being toast. 

It's my personal opinion and only opinion that GME will do a TSLA style split to screw the hedgies somewhere between those dates / months that have nothing officially scheduled. I believe the only reason those dates are empty is because they have announcements planned there.
