When I first mentioned that OTC was being used to manipulate $GME I was hammered and told $GME is not even traded on OTC. Little did those apes know that any stock can be traded on OTC and it is the wild West of the market. Since then a lot of apes are catching wise to the OTC dark pool that has been used to short ladder attack $GME and that’s just great.

OTC trades for $GME

525,247,648/5,777,645 = 90.91 shares per trade

FINRA data pull of all tier 2 $GME shares since 02/08/2021

535,650,669/9,511,674 = 56.31 shares per trade

OTC + tier 2 trades

1,060,898,317/15,289,319 = 69.38 shares per trade

Of course, this is FINRA data and the heggies pretty much can report anything they want. Especially with OTC data. So, the math probably looks more like this

I know you’re also thinking, how can there be 1 billion in volume since February? We better verify this with a yahoo finance day by day data pull.

And the volume since February 8th adds up to 1,379,940,300

Wait so the market reported volume has a 319,041,983 share discrepancy than what is reported on FINRA? (BTW the volume has been 2,642,030,700 since the start of 2021 but I can’t get a FINRA data pull for January)

Hey Heggies, is there 319 million synthetic $GME shares right now?

Since these are most likely shorts underreported in OTC market trading;

$GME is likely shorted at least 457% of total shares and 706% of the float. I wouldn’t be surprised if the January numbers raise this estimate to the top end that another ape pointed out around 900%

More shorting evidence. As Citadel’s ownership in $GME share drops the price rips. They are shorting it to hold it down. Also note that their volume drops during that weeklong SSR saga. Meaning they don’t care to have $GME shares if they can’t short them.

Of course, the ETFs holding $GME got shorted to hide shorts. So, how does the Heggie favorite $GME shell $XRT look?

OTC 18,203,955/51,055 = 356 shares per trade.

Tier 1 shares since January 20,944,966/130,060 = 161 shares per trade.

Alt 843,986/6,569 = 128 shares per trade

OTC + Alt + tier 1 shares 39,992,907/187,684 = 213 shares per trade.

Alright now for the yahoo data pull, and… WTF?

The volume has been 267,687,800 since January. A discrepancy of 227,694,893! Too be fair $GME at only 20% of $XRT’s portfolio the heggies must short $XRT 5 times as hard.

So, the biggest spike in volume is right at the January peak for $GME. Basically, the short shell game started right away. No surprise seeing some volume spikes around $GME SSR times.

Update below, $XRT now only holds 6.75% of its portfolio in $GME. This shell game is coming to a close.

I’m sure this all normal.

Anyway, back to $GME.

First thing to point out, do you see how the volume jumps prior to the January price peak? If the shorts covered and that really was a short squeeze the volume would be up with the price not before it. The shorts absolutely have not covered. This was either a gamma squeeze or good old-fashioned share buying.

Then some boomer writes in Forbes that hyper rational traders are buying calls to trigger gamma squeezes and all the apes forget the example used was buying calls for 2% of the share price. The $GME calls are up to 40% the share price. Also, now that it is established how dangerous the dark pool is, maybe not buy calls and just buy shares? They don’t have to delta hedge for calls you can’t or won’t exercise. If you don’t buy the 100 shares at the strike, neither do they. The are NOT obligated to. Heggies are market makers. This means they’re playing on godmode. They can just send you the delta. You have no way to hold them accountable to purchase those 100 shares if you don’t exercise the call.

This is how Citadel sees you if you set a stop loss, use margins, or YOLO on calls.

TL:DR

When Citadel has the volume, $GME dips. When apes have the volume, $GME rips.
