<p>Similar to Pixel upon release of my first DD I was sent threatening messages and my IP/VPN was attacked with tracking software. I have had 3 additional accounts banned from reports and IP tracking software. I believe they were most concerned about what I am about to release to this community now (I released a similar version of this DD to my private group).</p>

<p>Whenever looking at a massive war as a spectator I always look at who has most to benefit and lose from the situation. I believe this is what our Bloomberg terminals show us quite clearly:</p>

<p><strong>Shares vs Shorts - Blackrock/Vanguard vs Citadel/Susquehanna</strong></p>
<p>Most of the other names on the shares/options side of this stock are either directly or indirectly connected to one of these 4 major funds. However, this story does not begin with GameStop - in fact - GameStop is simply where it most likely will end.</p>

<p><strong>Tesla</strong></p>
<p>The war between Blackrock and Citadel/Susquehanna came to a culmination point around this stock in particular, but in this situation they found themselves on opposite sides of the trade:</p>
<p>Taken directly from Blackrock’s Wikipedia page:</p>
<h2>Global warming activities[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BlackRock&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12">edit</a>]</h2>
<p>Despite BlackRock's attempts to model itself as a sustainable investor, one report shows that BlackRock is the world’s largest investor in coal plant developers, holding shares worth $11 billion among 56 coal plant developers.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock#cite_note-82">[82]</a> Another report shows that BlackRock owns more oil, gas, and thermal coal reserves than any other investor with total reserves amounting to 9.5 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions – or 30 percent of total energy-related emissions from 2017.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock#cite_note-83">[83]</a></p>

<p>What stock serves as a great threat to the largest coal/oil investor in the world? You guessed it, EV and Solar.</p>

<p>Blackrock went short on Tesla along with most of the traditional wall street firms. Citadel and Susquehanna super accumulated shares and options to go deep long:</p>
<p><a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link</a></p>
<p>10% of Citadels holdings are in Tesla options</p>
<p>Citadel CEO Ken Griffin has ownership through company entities, including the hedge fund, a total of 7,864,059 Tesla shares. That’s a 4.3% stake in Tesla.</p>
<p><a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-international-group-llp#tabholdings_tab_link">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-international-group-llp#tabholdings_tab_link</a></p>
<p>11% of Susquehanna holdings are in Tesla options</p>
<p>Susquehanna International Group, Llp has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 2,203,701 shares of Tesla Motors, Inc.</p>
<p>Susquehanna, Citadel, and retail ultimately slowly squeezed Blackrock out of Tesla resulting in an approximate 550 billion dollar gain (rocketing both of them into top 10 funds worldwide). The gain in their portfolios in 2020 is staggeringly large (30-45%) and almost directly congruent to Tesla’s rapid stock rise.</p>
<p>What does the #1 firm on wall street do when they get squeezed? They squeeze back:</p>
<p>“Sir, I’ve found a subsidiary of Citadel named Melvin has been shorting the shit out of a low float brick and mortar named GameStop. They even installed snake board members and are planning on bankrupting the company due to bond defaults at the end of 2020.”</p>

<p>To reform a corrupt board/company takes 2 things: voting share majority and a kickass CEO:</p>
<p>In 2011, at the age of 25, Cohen founded Chewy under its original name of MrChewy.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-lima-5">[5]</a> Cohen says his inspiration for picking the pet category came from his experience shopping for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle">poodle</a> Tylee.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-forbes-6">[6]</a> He cites his father Ted, who ran a glassware importing business, as a mentor.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-verdon-7">[7]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-rcohen-8">[8]</a> In need of capital, Cohen says he originally approached over 100 venture capital firms and was rejected by all of them.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-adams-9">[9]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-dahlberg2-10">[10]</a> In 2013, Cohen secured the company's first outside investment from Volition Capital for $15 million.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-cohen-11">[11]</a> By 2016, he had raised capital from investors including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock">BlackRock</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Rowe_Price">T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-zaleski-12">[12]</a> That year the company had $900 million in sales and had become the number 1 online pet retailer.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-armental-13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Getting the picture yet? Blackrock helped Ryan Cohen not only capitalize his company for an online takeover, they also assisted in his sale to PetSmart AND listing on the NYSE. The same year Blackrock invested in Chewy, it became the #1 online pet retailer. Back to GameStop - 9 million shares from RC alone isn’t enough for a voting majority or to oust a corrupt board (we saw the CFOs lame attempt to get RC ousted). But, when you combine Blackrock/Vanguard/RC’s voting shares you get damn near half the available float.</p>
<p>Fellow apes - we are not running with a whale or even a kong. We are riding on the back of KING FUCKING KONG - the largest investment firm in the entire world, Blackrock. So as you continue your screeching and slinging of ape shit, do so with bravado and confidence knowing we are backed by the biggest fucking ape of our world. Godspeed space travelers.</p>

<p>EDIT - Thank you very much. If you appreciate it, please upvote, Wuz' DDs seem to get buried on this sub. Also I just read the teleprompter Ron Burgundy-style this is all Wuz. But again, thank you for the awards and votes.</p>
