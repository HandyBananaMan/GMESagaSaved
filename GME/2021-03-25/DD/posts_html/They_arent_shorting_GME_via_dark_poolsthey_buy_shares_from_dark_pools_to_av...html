<h1>Title: "They aren't shorting GME via dark pools...they buy shares from dark pools to avoid creating buy pressure, and then either deliver them to close out FTDs or sell them on the market to create sell pressure. This is another form of market manipulation."</h1>

<p>"It's likely that all the ETF rebalancing allowed them to extract all those gme shares which were then sold to the shorts in dark pool transactions. i would wager thats  where they got a lot of the ammo for today's attack. </p>
<p>No matter, it was just another desperate stall tactic..shorts will be forced to cover soon enough! </p>
