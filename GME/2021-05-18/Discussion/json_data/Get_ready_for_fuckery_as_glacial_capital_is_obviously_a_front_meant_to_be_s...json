    "selftext": "Edit* this is purely speculation.  I apologize for the title making it seem like fact.  Also do not attempt to day trade as nobody really knows how the price action will until well it happens and selling will only aid the constant short attacks that keep the price below 180 as of rn.\nEdit 2* trading halts are not done by hedge funds or anyone else but are a natural occurrence when the price skyrockets really high with a short amount of time.  When the price does not move it does not immediately mean that people are going to sell off.  It just means you won\u2019t see any movement until the trading halt is done.\nThe price is most likely going to skyrocket over the course of a couple days.  What does this mean.  It means there will be most likely a repeat of last March.  What fucked many people over last March was the sheer amount of shares Citadel and Melvin capital sold that drove the price down enough to trigger people\u2019s stop loss orders.  So what do you do? Get rid of your stop loss orders if you haven\u2019t already.  Do not attempt a day trade during this event as you will have no clue when the drop will be and how far it will go since many people will not have stop loss orders.  There will be price halts during this as they\u2019re gonna try to shake our diamond hands as hard and as sudden as possible to maybe shake our wills up.  Buy and Hodl and more margin calls will be triggered.  This is a very dangerous play for them but what can they do? They\u2019re running out of shares to borrow and running low on capital.  Kenneth griffin will fight even if loss is imminent.  The squeeze has not squozen until citadel or all hedge funds shorting gme have gone bankrupt and the dtcc insurance kicks in.  Only then will the squeeze really begin.  Hodl strong guys.  Victory is near.",
