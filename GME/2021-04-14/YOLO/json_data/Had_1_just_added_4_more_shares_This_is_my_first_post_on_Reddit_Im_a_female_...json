The pandemic and 2021 has been hard on me like everyone else and gme has given me hope and so much entertainment. Thank you to everyone who writes hours and hours of DD, helping a smooth brain like myself understand what the hell is going on. My dad was a computer programmer and had my brother and I on our own computers by the time we were 5. We LIVED at GameStop. My brother and I have never had the closest relationship and when my dad passed away suddenly a year ago I figured we would never have a chance at one. Until GameStop. It\u2019s changed everything and we talk more now than we ever have. Even if there is no squeeze, the relationships that have been formed are priceless. HODL",
