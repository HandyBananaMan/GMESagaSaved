Tomorrow we may have covering from the FTD 21 cycle having yesterday as the last day to find shares and today force covering gonna be fun to see what happens 👀.
* Some 🦍s also found out how the [FTDs affect Crypto liquidation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwm7wg/with_all_the_talk_about_t21_and_the_current/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and another one may have found [Kennys wallet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkknwz/bitcoin_address_activity_another_set_of_eyes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) 👀

* there's More Robinhood incorrect cost biases [being reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nl63sz/did_i_buy_0165_shares_of_gme_for_632615_on_april/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) this is a tax matter if you're having this "problem" here's a handy how to on [reporting it to the IRS](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nhi0qz/how_to_report_suspected_fraud_to_the_irs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (i shared it before but its worth a re-mention)
* Im not sure i mentioned this before but there's a little known [140% short interest rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndx8ay/after_hearing_about_the_140_rule/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (this would explain Januaries reported interest which is theorized to be much higher, because the goal was to short Gamestop out of existence, being limited to 140%. I can't imagine how big the Shorts really are are)
* to end it here's some [Green Crayon Fluff](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nl7r5d/gme_525_on_market_watch/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
