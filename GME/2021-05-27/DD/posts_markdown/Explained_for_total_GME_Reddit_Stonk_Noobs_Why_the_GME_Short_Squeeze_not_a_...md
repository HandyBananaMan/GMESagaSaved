Are you worried that the GME 'short squeeze' thesis is crazy tin-foil hat conspiracy, like a financial Qanon of sorts? Here is a guide, explained so complete GME, stonk, reddit noobs can understand it, that seeks to debunk that worry, with lots of links for helpful data for the skeptical.

>TL;DR: The short answer as to why the GME short-squeeze play isn't 'financial Qanon' can be summed up most simply in the following way:  
>  
>*Evidence points to* [2008 style market fraud](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/how-wall-streets-bankers-stayed-out-of-jail/399368/) \- this time not due to mortgage backed securities, but rather, "naked short selling"  *- along with a 2008 style coverup, which will go on until there is no alternative but* [market crash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvj8fz/where_there_is_smoke_there_is_fire/)*. Part of the cause and/or fallout of this crash is a likely GME "short squeeze" of a size never before seen (called the* [MOASS](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4hqkc/gme_moass_faq/) *around here), and unlikely to ever happen again as regulations are being put into place to prevent it. There are solid reasons why the mainstream financial media,* [like in 2008](https://app.hedgeye.com/insights/70141-remember-this-jim-cramer-bear-stearns-is-fine-do-not-take-your-mon)*, is barely reporting this, see section right below for this.*

For the record, this post is written by someone who 'generally' finds mainstream media pretty reliable on many issues (especially New York Times, Wash. Post, Guardian UK, CNN, NPR), but even they seem to have missed this. For quick hard data to back up claims, and basic definition of a 'short squeeze', see separate sections below, here's the longer version. 

\--------------------

# 1. The big question: Why hasn't the mainstream media reported on the 'real' GME situation?

The main reason is simple: a [2008 style crash is coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nj1guf/were_all_fucked/), due to [massive](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/) [securities fraud](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2008/34-57511.pdf). And just like 2008, it seems simply 'unthinkable' to many, in the media and beyond, that that their 'trusted' sources would [lie](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-fc.shtml) to them, certainly not 2008-style once again. But we should've learned. There is massive incentive to do so, and regulations are so lax as to make fraud so easy, it tends to happen on a small scale and everyone just looks the other way. At least, until someone gets super greedy and does it on a massive scale, which is what happened here, and nobody wants to admit to it until they have to.

So those who know what's going on tell the mainstream press 'don't worry, everything is fine!', just like they did in 2008. And the mainstream press, which barely understands today's complex markets (full of algorithmic high-freq trading, AI, data mining, virtual shares, and various derivative instruments, oh my!), is largely fed info by their insider contacts (and sometimes [owners](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms7s31/motley_fool_is_a_hedgefund_with_a_newspaper/)),, in the hope that, duped or otherwise, they will manage expectations until everything is ready. Just like 2008, all over again.

Now it is likely the big players know this 2008-style crash is [coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvaaa7/reposting_gme_and_the_market_crash/), but they want to avoid panic before all the safeguards are in place for a 'controlled detonation' of a toxic partner who will be positioned as the 'lone bad apple' that causes the crash. All this likely happening again because incentive for fraud with lax enforcement is simply too great. For no matter how mathy they may seem, markets and their reporting, and so much else related to economics and politics, come down to human agents who, in the absence of guardrails,  rely on trust and various norms.And that all works, at least, until the players reveal they aren't trustworthy, and then so many people are 'shocked' even though they shouldn't be.

But we've seen this movie before (literally!). In 2008, everyone believed that Moody's bond ratings were the gold standard of trust. Then [Dr. Michael Burry](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cthume/dr_michael_burry_and_the_big_gamestop_short/) and friends did their homework to show that [Moody's](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/14/moodys-864m-penalty-for-ratings-in-run-up-to-2008-financial-crisis) hadn't done theirs (see the movie '[The Big Short' for more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film))), and the reason why is that Moody's trusted what they were told, which turned out to be fraudulent in relation to sub-prime mortgages and the mortgage back securities upon which the repo market was based. This meant that the collateral supporting these was crap, and that lead to a confidence and liquidity crisis, and government bailout. But mainstream media said Lehman was [solid](https://www.cnbc.com/2008/06/12/before-demotion-callan-said-lehman-was-solid.html) until it wasn't, and 'buy Bear Stearns' until they declared bankruptcy. Will we learn?

Something similar is happening right here today. If you do the math, and start to check the numbers backing up the 'easy to get' numbers - all using all publicly available official data - the numbers just [don't add up](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m68t8p/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/). The mainstream media don't want to take the time to do the math, cause they trust they don't need to, but for those willing to check the numbers, there's only a small handful of ways to explain the discrepencies, all of which point to massive securities fraud due to ['naked shorting',](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9bfp0/naked_short_selling_the_truth_is_much_worse_than/) a practice the [SEC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp) has said could destabilize the market, though it has only tried to limit this in the most 'slap on the wrist' kinda way.

So here we are. A 2008-like situation, all over again. The only difference is the big players have a huge jump on [preparing for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mt45h8/big_banks_are_outdoing_each_other_with_record/) (huge bond sales, repo mkt, crypto dump?!), and the regulatory agencies are filing [regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m793h7/new_dtcc_rule_just_passed_in_effect_immediatly/) at a fever pace to protect as much of their asses as possible, to try keep the detonation of today's Lehmans and AIGs from truly collapsing near everything. But it's in their best interest to keep this hush-hush for now, cause the more time to get things ready the better for them, and the less likely things will get out of hand. Anecdotal evidence is that this is an open secret on the street, but so long as the press is kept quiet until it's impossible to deny, the better for them, and that's not that difficult, because who in the media would want to imagine that their most beloved sources are lying to them, or playing dumb, despite 2008? 

The main difference between now and 2008 is last time it was mortgage backed securities, this time it is naked shorting, but very similar game. 

\----------

# 2. Understanding the GME Short-Squeeze Argument, explained so anyone can understand it:

&#x200B;

>**a) The setup - "naked shorting":**

The practice of "naked short selling" is a form of systemic corruption in the US stock market today. Most major players (i.e. Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, etc.) have gotten slaps on the wrist for it, but regulation is spotty at best. Technically, naked shorting is securities fraud, and the SEC published a paper on risks of this practice to market as a whole, though they did little to stop it (see the well sourced wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling).)

But the regulatory agencies which report on short selling (via FINRA) 'self-regulate', like so much in the markets, with revolving door between the regulators and the very companies they regulate (just like SEC), so there's little incentive to not do it naked sometimes. Not only is the data [self-reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwaxv/house_of_cards_part_2/),  'errors' are often reported years late (?!), and fines for 'errors' (whoops!) are often minimal compared to massive gains made from them, see [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwaxv/house_of_cards_part_2/), [here](https://www.scmp.com/business/markets/article/1846104/us-hedge-fund-citadel-banned-share-trading-shanghai-account), and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/) All of this means that it is easy to get away with shady short selling, such that some degree of  'naked shorting' is dirty open secret in US markets (see first link above).

One company that has been fined and banned from short selling in various international markets due to violations, well let's call it Shittydel, a major player on the NY stock exchange, a 'market maker' (kinda like a broker's broker), which gives it privileges to perform a limited legal form of naked short selling to keep the market liquid in its trades (kinda like lubrication).

Now  the investment wing of such a company would never [abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) that privilege, right?

&#x200B;

>b) O**verplaying their hand:**

Shittydel seems to have taken the naughty practice of naked shorting to the next level, likely by abusing market maker privileges, and done so on an unprecedented scale, all to make massive profits, but how?

Shorting involves borrowing a share in a way that lets the borrower bet that a stock will go down to a certain price. If it does, the shorter make a profit, and it if doesn't, they pay interest. If the shorter only 'pretends' they borrowed the share, they shorted naked (producing a 'counterfeit' share), and while they can get away with that for a while, at some point, they need to deliver a real share, and when they don't, it's a 'fail to deliver' (FTD). In addition, when a short position is taken, this leads those who sell the short to 'hedge' their bet by selling some of the stock themselves, having some indirect [downward pressure on the stock price](https://avgjoefinance.com/shorting-affect-stocks-price/).

Shittydel seems to have realized that by naked shorting, they could drive brick and mortar companies into the ground, and with quarantine, they ramped this up. This is a very expensive practice, but if the gamble works, and the company goes bankrupt, you [never have to pay the shorts back](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me4bw0/citadel_never_had_any_intention_of_ever_covering/) (see [Toys R Us](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me4bw0/citadel_never_had_any_intention_of_ever_covering/gsg9dff/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)!). The result is massive profits, and no no bill to pay for making them! (There even seems evidence that Shittydel may have naked shorted the repo market itself via 10 yr T bills, such that GME might not be the only toxic behavior at play, but the one they were most easily caught by, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/) for more info). What could go wrong?

&#x200B;

>**c) the Whale-trap:**

Enter another player, one of Shittydel's competitors for market dominance that would very much like to see Shittydel out of the picture. Let's call them Burp-rubb (or BR). Let's say they realized what Shittydel was likely doing, but like most big player funds, are prevented from taking advantage of this by various regulations that are more likely to be enforced than the naked shorting ones.

What BR likely realized was that they could set a trap for Shittydel. BR couldn't take them down in the open, but with the right opportunity, and the right bait, they could let others do it for them, and profit from the results. BR also wanted to get back of Shittydel for burning them in the past, long story...

While BR was waiting for the right opportunity, Shittydel turned its naked short sale sights on Gamestop, yet another struggling brick and mortar store. BR, realizing this, likely saw their opportunity to set the trap, and the rest is history.

See, recently a big fund had helped Ryan Cohen to develop his pet food e-commerce company Chewy, which he had then sold for billions. What if someone then helped fund Cohen's takeover of Gamestop as new CEO? What a nifty trap. Why?

Cohen's plan was to remake Gamestop into an e-commerce behemoth, like an Amazon of digital gaming (see [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-cohen-gamestop-transformation-ecommerce-explained-2021-3)), and when it was announced he was getting involved, this alone raised share price above the range of Shittydel shorts, trapping them, cause they can't get out of these bets *ever*, at least, until the prices goes down below that of their short bet. And they need to pay interest on these bets over time. Tick-tock.

At this point, 'somehow' (I will leave this up to the imagination ...) people on Reddit started to realize that that the most easily available public data on Gamestop was messed up, and some basic digging turned up the fact that there seemed to be [more shares shorted than should exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m8cj72/why_i_think_the_gme_short_interest_is_much_higher/), likely indicating naked shorting. This lead to the first [micro-squeeze in January](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH_F7mQIM0M), which got squashsed by Robinhood, etc.

Since then Shittydel and friends have said they covered their short contracts, and the easiest to find public data (ie: S3, Ortex) supports that. But as mentioned above, the numbers are self-reported, only a small fine for misdeeds, and the formula was even recently [changed](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lu1fu5/finra_changed_how_they_report_short_interest_this/) in a way that helps obscure precisely these sorts of shady practices (hmm).

 What the mainstream reporters likely didn't do was what the Redditors did do: rummage around, add up all the numbers (remember, it's all publicly available data!), and start asking questions. Like what happened with the Pentagon papers, or the Panama papers, or the Big Short .... (It's hard to explain stuff like [this](https://www.reuters.com/technology/gamestop-amc-short-sellers-sit-nearly-1-billion-loss-ortex-2021-05-18/) or [this](https://m.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/GAMESTOP-CORP-12790/news/Short-sellers-lost-818-million-on-Gamestop-bets-on-Wednesday-Ortex-32541213/) unless something shady is going on!).

Everything in the data pointed to one conclusion: Shittydel, which had a track record of fines and bans for naked shorting, was still doing this, [hiding their naked shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu4q3o/slb_ibkr_416_update_hedgies_not_covered_gme/) by failing to deliver, and covering this using various quasi-legal means that are decently hard to track (stuff with [ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ll1qb8/list_of_etfs_that_hold_gme_shares_and/), and '[synthetic calls/married puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m08xbn/explaining_gme_synthetic_long_shares_aka_fake/)',  hoping few check the details, waiting for the price to go down again so they could wiggle out of the trap.

This thesis is supported by the fact that since the Jan mini-squeeze, GME price would continually behave strangely, diving in price but with barely any volume of people selling (which is what normally makes prices drop). What could account for such behavior? Only one sensible thing: more short selling, which like the rest, was also not reported. That is, as crazy as it sounds, Shittydel was likely [doubling down](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mozzor/gme_short_between_110_1564_of_free_float_my_dd/), kicking the can down the road, in hope of shaking the crazy Reddit crowd. Don't believe me, check the links!

&#x200B;

>**d) The Turnaround:**

Now even beyond the squeeze, its worth saying, GME is headed for a very [strong e-commerce turnaround](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mwsxag/a_longterm_speculative_review_of_where_gamestop/). They are rebooting their brick and mortar locations as [gaming 'experience centers'](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m73ga7/want_to_see_what_the_new_gamestopcom_store_looks/), and have brought on a whole [new team](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mv5f18/%F0%9D%97%9A%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%BA%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%A6%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%98%80_%F0%9D%97%98%F0%9D%98%85%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%98%82%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%83%F0%9D%97%B2_%F0%9D%97%A7%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%BA_%F0%9D%97%95%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%B1_%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B3_%F0%9D%97%97%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B0%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%98%80/) of e-commerce heavy hitters with a [ton](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgdoty/three_executive_hires_today_one_from_amazon_and/) of experience to help Cohen bring about the transformation. They also just paid off whatever [debt](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes-0) could get in the way of this.

GME also just announced it's [getting into the NFT business](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nky0n0/gamestop_has_an_nft_website_setup/), and [NFT Gamestop tokens](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqhjzw/why_gamestop_hiring_someone_with_blockchain/) would be a smart way to create an entire second-hand digital gaming market, a huge development. Now such tokens could also be issued to shareholders as dividend to thank them, which is also a sneaky way to snag short sellers, as [Overstock](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mpm3vs/overstock_triggered_a_short_squeeze_summer_2020/) did with a crypto dividend when it was over-shorted in 2019.

NFTs, like crypto, are essentially impossible to forge. If dividends are offered in NFT, only real shares will get those, and 'counterfeit' naked ones won't, which will show what's real and what's not, making it impossible for naked shorters to lie. Overstock got sued for doing this, so they had to show a legit reason for doing what they did, namely, hard evidence that people had naked shorted them using counterfeit shares. They did this by having a shareholder vote, and showing that there were way more votes than shares, and so Overstock won the court battle, and the result was a short squeeze.

Well, Gamestop is currently holding a shareholder vote for its new board of directors, for the June 9th shareholders meeting. [Tick tock.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mqt7w6/gamestop_vs_overstock/)

&#x200B;

>**e) The Movement:**

Now all this is unprecedented in the market (if you don't count 2008, at least), which is why Shittydel likely figured they could get away with naked shorting like this. They bet that everyday 'dumb money' stock purchasers (retail investors) wouldn't be able to sift through all their complex [ways](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv5kbm/deep_dive_into_dark_pool_trading_how_they_might/) of [hiding their naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwbk4y/this_drop_is_synthetic_and_i_think_we_might_be/). and even if they did, it would take hordes of them buying and not selling as individuals, even when the price was artificially tanked by yet more shorting, to catch them, and what's the chance they would all figure it out? Before the internet and social media, this would've been impossible, and even today, it took a while for an online community to start going through the data together, looking for explanations.

But once it happened, it congealed into a movement. So many were burned by 2008, and the regulators are letting it happen again?! The GME movement on Reddit left r/WSB as their mods were likely infiltrated by those wanting to scare off short squeezers, with the group landing at r/GME and r/Superstonk. From there, crowds of people educated themselves, wrong data and incoherent hypotheses were scathingly debunked, the Redditors even evolved a form of [peer review](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/), and brought in [expert witnesses](https://www.youtube.com/c/Superstonk/videos) in weekly [AMA interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/wiki/index/ama) to gain the insight of those with real old-school chops yet willing to take on the system. It likely helped that some of these Redditors have relevant backgrounds. But each makes their own decisions, and the mantra is: do your own homework, don't believe anyone else, make your own informed decisions. This is why DD, or "due diligence" is so valued.

Why did this happen now? Shittydel's practices threaten the stability of the whole game, rigged and corrupt as it may be. The only way to stop them, with a toothless SEC, was to take a big chunk of the market with it, which BR was happy to do, cause they'd be there to pick up the pieces cheap to reap massive profits when market eventually recovered, and the govt has incentives to not get in the way of the removal of this toxic player. So Shittydel now spends its final days unable to get out of its short positions, spending gobs of cash [delaying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvnfq6/why_would_short_sellers_keep_doubling_down_on/) and spreading info that the squeeze is over or already happened, in the hopes that everyday investors walk away, but Reddit keeps showing that the numbers indicate that Shittydel's claims are as fake as their shares. 

&#x200B;

>**f) The Controlled Detonation:**

The result is that [GME is set up to be the MOASS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml48ov/walkin_like_a_duck_talkin_like_a_duck/) (mother of all short squeezes), not for any reason really having to do with the stonk's 'fundamentals' (though the shift to e-commerce is part of why this all comes together), but mostly because it was how Shittydel got caught with their hand [way deep in the cookie jar](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/). Keep in mind, [there have been short squeezes before, and while very unusual events, when they happen, they're pretty crazy to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mekkxf/predicting_the_gme_short_squeeze_price_based_on/), and this one is so unique, that it's gonna be a once in a lifetime kinda thing, cause they won't let this happen again.

What seems to benefit the most players, considering the circumstances, would then be a '[controlled detonation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n5jqse/reminder_the_price_is_irrelevant_this_is_the_only/)' of the now toxic Shittydel. All the new regs going on the books (from DTCC, DTC, NSCC, OCC, ICC, FINRA) are there to make sure that when a big player goes down, the effects are limited as much a possible from impacting what's around it. Shittydel will then likely take the fall for the entire market's dirty secret regarding naked shorting, but as it got greedy, there it goes.

It's in the best interest of all the big players that this controlled detonation happens. Let's go through the list on why.

\- BR likely set the trap, and will be there to pick up the pieces, with a major competitor eliminated, and gain big bucks from market dominance after this.

\- Govt takes out a player that was doing stuff that threatened the status quo of the market with its risky practices, with a nice fall-guy to be 'the lone bad apple' so they don't have to change too much afterwards (though many Redditors hope to create pressure for change post-MOASS). Govt will also likely be able to limit the damage to the rest of the economy this way, and will also make massive taxes from the [winnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/). This will  be like another round of targeted stimulus that, unlike traditional stimuluses that tend to get siphoned off by corporations before getting spent, will go directly to consumers. Calculations indicate that cost for the entire squeeze, even at its most massive, would [likely](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations_for_the_total_payout_of_gme_based_on/) be about 5 trillion, not more than the most recent stimulus, and 40 percent of that would all but immediately return to the Fed via taxes.

\- Shittydel knows they're caught, and they get some time to try to wiggle out while the rules are put into place, and maybe even hide some assets [offshore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mokvhk/chaos_theory_the_everything_connection/), but if they go along nicely once things start, this will likely allow their main players to avoid jail time.

\- Everyday retail investors? We may be pawns of BR's trap for Shittydel, and merely going along for the ride, but unlike many market crashes, we will likely be well paid for playing this role, and quite empowered going forward. Some have said the MOASS could be the single largest top-down transfer of wealth in human history (oops, Shittydel, that ain't supposed to happen!).

# APPENDIX:

&#x200B;

>***1) But what's a Short Squeeze?***

A [short squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze) is when all the 'real' shares of a company are recalled, so that all the [counterfeit shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling) produced by naked shorting need to be paid back immediately to those they were borrowed from, and often several times over, and in this case, only 'real' shares will work. But if the owners of the real shares decide to just hold and not sell, the price will keep going up, and shorts will scramble over themselves to sell before the price goes yet higher. The price can go as high as the owners of real shares have patience to hold, infinity is the limit.

Once the price hits certain levels, however, a fund will get '[margin called](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp)', because its on paper debts start to exceed what others think they can pay. This leads to their creditors calling for more collateral from the shorts, and if they don't have any more, regulators take control of their assets, and liquidate them via computerized automatic auction. From there, it is just watch the price go up to the moon, as the shorts who are on the hook for whatever price stuff sells at, with the whole process now out of their hands. If the shorts go bankrupt, their creditors are on the hook, and if they go bankrupt, there's clearing houses, their insurance, and at last resort, the Fed itself. Now the government could step in and change the rules of the game, but if they did this, the whole world might see the US stock market as untrustworthy, and so to keep the world's business, it is in the interest of the Fed to let the short squeeze happen.

&#x200B;

>***2) Quick evidence that a market crash is likely coming:***

a) the [VIX index](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mpt45u/vix_gme_connection/), used to track likelihood of volatility, has been hitting record  numbers lately of the sort which only tend to occur before a major market event, most frequently a crash.

b) the [repo market](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/why-the-fed-pumps-billions-into-repo-market/). I heard it once said that if the stock market is a car, the repo market is the transmission, and when the transmission seizes, like it did in 2008, everything stops. The repo market (and its complement the reverse repo market) is how the Fed adjusts overall market liquidity, providing overnight loans of cash or securities to keep markets and the economy more generally well lubricated and moving. The repo market is also the main way the government puts more money into the economy when it 'prints' it, or pulls money out of the economy to fight inflation. The '[quantitative easing](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/01/28/what-is-the-repo-market-and-why-does-it-matter/)' that the Fed has used since the 2008 crisis to manage the overall state of the economy via money supply has largely occurred through how it works its repo/reverse repo markets. Right now almost all the funds which could take repo money are doing so, and while there's usually a ton of excess room to adjust here, the repo market is hitting record levels of use, and is nearing its cash ceiling. This signals likely market crash unless something big happens to prevent it.

c) Regulatory agencies filing new regs at frantic pace, all designed to limit exposure in case of a major default, likely because they see something huge coming. [New regulations summarized.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhh0f1/update_go_nogo_for_launch_the_checklist_keeping/)

>***3) Quick evidence what's going to happen likely will involve a GME 'short squeeze':***

a) GME has a verrry high [negative Beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6mje0/gme_beta_from_bloomberg_and_ownership_update/), an indicator that means a stock goes up when the market goes down. Unprecedented at this level, the only reasonable explanation is a major market player is likely selling oodles of other assets to get cash to depress the price of GME when it spikes up.

b) since the January micro-squeeze, GME price dives even if very few are selling, and many are actually buying according to volume data. This means that the price depression is due to [shorting that is not being reported ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5wrl4/summary_of_shorting_techniques_used_by_hedgies/)to the normal market channels.

c) FINRA data on GME has tons of [FTDs (failures to deliver)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228260887_Naked_Short_Sales_and_Fails_to_Deliver_An_Overview_of_Clearing_and_Settlement_Procedures_for_Stock_Trades_in_the_US), even as short interest numbers have recently switched to calculate percent of float rather than percent of existing shares, muddying the waters conveniently for big shorts. FINRA data shows that no matter how much those who shorted GME in January say they got out of their positions, the FTDs [indicate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msm49u/my_second_rebuttal_to_deleted_but_important_bear/) that there are likely still far more ['counterfeit' shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mn0q9q/theory_all_the_pieces_pt_1_the_anatomy_of_the/) than real ones, all produced by 'naked shorting' and hidden by quasi-legal market [manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwx5nk/forget_hiding_ftds_in_etfs_they_are_being_hidden/) (ETF sales, 'dark pool' exchanges, and [synthetic calls/married puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcvnnk/synthetic_share_tracing_ignition_inevitable/) (also see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lkpnod/a_conservative_count_of_synthetic_long_positions/)).

d) Every day the price goes down and selling volume does not seem to cause this, this is likely due to further shorting, in an attempt to kick the can down the road, discourage talk of a 'short squeeze', and [dig the short sellers deeper in the hole](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lsvpq6/really_long_dd_and_analysis_what_happened/). The amount of cash needed to do this is beyond massive, making it likely that the huge negative Beta is because a major market player is about to be liquidated because for shorting beyond belief to get out of being short squeezed in GME, and likely [did not](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg79zp/proof_that_gme_is_not_a_sell_off_but_short_attacks/) [succeed](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcdw5x/gme_down_25_today_on_almost_no_volume_this_is_not/).
