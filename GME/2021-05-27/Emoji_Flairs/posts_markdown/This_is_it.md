I don't post frequently, just wanted to say thank you for being excellent everyone.

We knew a long time, that they're going to pump other stocks in an attempt to shake us. We haven't won yet, but we are close. Each day, each battle takes us closer to victory.

Buy, hold and vote while staying excellent to each other.

EDIT: wow, this blew up! Thank you everyone, just shows how good of a community we are! Can't wait to meet every single one of you beautiful bastards in outer space!
