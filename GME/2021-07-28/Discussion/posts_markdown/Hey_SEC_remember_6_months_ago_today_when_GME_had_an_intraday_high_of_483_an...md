# Title: Hey SEC, remember 6 months ago today when GME had an intraday high of $483 and they blatantly manipulated the market by blocking retail from buying securities nosediving the price of the stock costing retail traders billions of dollars?

\*CORRECT MOTHER FUCKERS may at this point include yourselves for being complicit unless you act now (all eyes on you Gurbir Grewal)...

They straight up robbed retail in broad fucking daylight with the police watching and the world recording it on their cell phones and motherfuckers need to be placed in prison over this sooner rather than later.
