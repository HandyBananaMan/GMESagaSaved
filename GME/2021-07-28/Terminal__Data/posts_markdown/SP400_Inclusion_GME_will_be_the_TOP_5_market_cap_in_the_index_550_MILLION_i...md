**Executive Summary: GME with a market cap of $13+ billion (*****so far*****) joins the S&P 400 Midcap. That market cap will be the fifth biggest among the index's 400 companies.

Therefore, about $550 million (0.61% \* $90 billion) worth of GME is expected to be bought once the index rebalancing completes.**
