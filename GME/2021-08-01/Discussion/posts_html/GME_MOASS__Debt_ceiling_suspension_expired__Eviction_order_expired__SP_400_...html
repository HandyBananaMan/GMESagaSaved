<p>Way too much FUD this weekend!!</p>
<p>Let's go down a quick list:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The markets crashing won't necessarily trigger MOASS" -- sure, let's just dismiss countless months worth of research on collateral, collateral requirements, and prime brokers liquidating their clients (Shitty Hedgie Fundies). NOT! <strong>Markets crashing will make the MOASS exponentially much more imminent</strong>.</li>
<li>"Politicians are corrupt!" -- gee, color me surprised? Don't be scared hedgie, we are throwing you in PRISON!</li>
<li>"Here are the X politicians who didn't report their stonks!" -- are we the congress police now or some shit? bad fud</li>
<li>"The shorting bill BARELY passed!" -- haha, okay? but it passed, so suck it.</li>
<li>"Robinhood has lost X amount of money on Y date" -- okay, and who cares?</li>
<li>"Post MOASS there will be a WEIRD situation" -- what's that? wall street being thrown in prison? not all that weird to me.</li>
<li>and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>The POINT is: we are being slided on. Do not let all these haters distract us from the <strong>cold, hard, facts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debt ceiling suspension has EXPIRED</li>
<li>Congress in a deadlock in regards to the debt ceiling, on vacation for 6 weeks</li>
<li><strong>Collateral assets to become more expensive</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shortage of T-Bills</strong></li>
<li><strong>Secretary Yellen posturing to resort to "emergency measures"</strong></li>
<li>Evictions are back on the menu</li>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 400 MidCap inclusion</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Keep your eye on GME! MOASS, GME, BUY, HODL, MOON, HYPE.</h1>
<p>We need to be speaking about GME, GME, GME and not what Robinhood is doing, or how corrupt our politicians are. I can't believe we fell for it this weekend.</p>
<p>Anyhow: GME 🚀</p>
<p>🐘🦍<strong>TITS JACKED</strong> 😍✅💰</p>
