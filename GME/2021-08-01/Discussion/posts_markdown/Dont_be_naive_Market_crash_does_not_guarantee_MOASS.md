Across all the GME subs I’m seeing a dangerous mindset take hold: market crash = moass.  While possible, that shit is FAR from a certainty - but believing it as gospel could be devastating to ape morale if it doesn’t play out like that.  

The volatility during a violent correction / crash are most certainly going to directly affect GME and the bad actors on the other side of this trade.  But seriously - do you magnificent idiots really think these funds can’t predict and profitably trade through the same forthcoming crash we are anticipating?  

#Cmon now.  

They short for a living.  They fucking crushed it so hard in 08 that short selling banks and brokerages was temporarily banned https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-211.htm

#Don’t think for a single solitary fucking second they’re not planning on doing that same shit again, reaping insane profits - all while they tune the algos to trade gme down along with the rest of the broad market as it circles the damn drain.  

It’s nice to be optimistic, and I think the idea MOASS could be triggered by the market tanking is a reasonable expectation, but the reality is that shit is not a ‘given’.  Nothing is.  I’d say the the long term success of this company is about as close to a certainty as any other variable in this play - but even that - it’s not guaranteed.  

It doesn’t matter that these big shorts are cornered with no way to get out of this trade alive - they’re still fucking titans and have the intentions and resources to drag this out for eternity.  Their very existance, and way of life - all depends on it, so admitting defeat will never happen.  They will need to be forced out of this position, kicking and screaming like the whiny little worthless & cheating children they are.  

#This is not FUD, it’s reality.  Accept it, and it will make you stronger.  

They are still trapped in a room full of loaded mousetraps, and all it takes is one to set off a chain reaction that cannot be stopped.  Market crash is most certainly one of the traps in that room, but it is absolutely NOT a certainty to be the trigger.   My belief is the shorts are anticipating the crash, hoping it dilutes the retail movement by means of middle class pain and enough apes needing to sell to stay afloat - planning for this whole thing to fizzle out in time and they quietly make their exit.  They intend to navigate this shitstorm profitably and praying it defeats our beautiful legion of retards.  The lights aren’t on all night long to cry about their position, they’re strategizing to stay alive long enough to defeat us.

#(Spoiler alert: it won’t work)

While not undetectable by the general public, this crime simply cannot be proven due to features, not bugs - in a system which carefully architected the equities markets to facilitate the biggest ponzi scheme of all time.  Let’s review some of them, shall we?

-over voting proving the existance of phantom shares: deleted as part of the voting process and rules.

-complete non-existance of short interest reporting by firms. (Though this could be about to change with the latest bill approved by the house)

-negligable penalties, with no jailtime for the crime - which only comes several years following the crime itself.

-the Stock Borrow Program from the NSCC, obligations warehouse -both ‘self regulating’ private entities mind you- and the absurd concept of continuous net settlement - are all working in unison to obscure the fact that securities are being sold, paid for, and never delivered.  These systems EXIST to ensure naked shorts are unable to be proven / caught / forced to close via the SEC’s regSHO provisions of tracking FTD’s and identifying threshold securities. 

-though allegedly about to change in september with the CAT audit trail - the regulators have no ability to trace individual transactions on exchanges back to the parties who transacted them, so even when it is KNOWN that naked short selling is occurring on a given security- the system protects the ‘who’ in total anonymity.  

-ability to abuse privileges to combine the additional settlement time afforded by ‘bona fide market making’ with illegal options transactions to ‘reset’ the clock on securities they fail to deliver, in perpetuity, and once again, without the ability to be traced.  

-use of the mainstream / corporate media to create new version of reality - their version - in an attempt to obfuscate the truth by creating only narratives which benefit their short position.

All this comes together to form the full 🌈🐻 voltron: the ability to collect money for each security sold short, with no regard to whether it was actually borrowed or not, and never ever deliver it.  This is BY FAR the most OP shit i’ve ever seen, gaming or otherwise - and the bad actors we’re up against in this trade have utilized and abused this glitch for DECADES, becoming wealthy & powerful beyond our wildest imagination.  If a 50% + correction in S&P500 doesn’t take these shitheads down - you heard it here first: don’t be surprised.  

Align your expectations with the reality that this could go on for years.  Keep doing what you’re doing - buy and hold, exercise your right to comment to the regulators, stay frosty and continue to drag the waters for every shred of evidence against what has been the perfect crime: naked short selling.  

Until now.

#Important closing thoughts
Every single short squeeze had one thing in common (besides 🌈🐻’s of course): the element of surprise.  That WAS us in january.  They never saw it coming, and we rectum - damn near killed ‘em.  But after deleting the buy button, they defeated us - but ONLY as the element of surprise.  Now, we’ve become a constant.  I dont know about you - but to me, it sure looks like they’ve figured out how to live with it.  They’re not happy about it - they’re realllllllly pissed we found their secret tendie tree - but IMO they’ve done a pretty good job thus far of adapting to our presence and awareness.

So if all us literal dummies see a market correction / crash coming, it’s fair to assume it won’t present the element of surprise we probably need in order to reach escape velocity.  I mean, we know for a FACT they are watching GME reddit subs, if there’s any truth to the timing and severity of a forthcoming crash - I speculate that they’re all over that shit, and positioning themselves to benefit tremendously from it.  I mean - they’re hedgefunds.  They hedge.  And if they do a good enough job at it - they’ll come out of a crash even stronger, with more margin to post against this absurd short position- despite the high likelihood that their long positions will take a BATH during a crash like they did last year.  Through shorting and derivatives, they can make a killing on a crash with very little up-front cash or margin requirements.  

So, in my retarded opinion, none of which is financial advice by the way - the element of surprise will most likely come from the regulators, or gamestop themselves.  As long as we keep doing our thing, liking and holding the stock en masse - the shorts stay cornered, and the shitshow continues.  It’s entirely possible that a crash sets off the rocket - but it’s not guaranteed - so let’s not psych ourselves up for it, in the event it doesn’t pan out the way we’d hoped.  

In moments like this, when we’re down - but not out - NEVER forget:  ‘hang in there’.

Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Tldr; there is no tldr, its already in the damn title.  Aside the god tier dd, and some solid thoughts I’m seeing shared - there’s been a few highly awarded low quality, cringe level lightspeed stupid bullshit posts making their way to ‘best’ and such in these subs simply because of the power of confirmation bias in a really fucking resonent echo chamber.  You already know the play: like the stock?  -then buy and hold it.  If you want to become truly informed, skip the fucking tldr’s and learn, you beautiful idiots, you, and use those smooth brains before giving awards and updoots.  

Feel free to crosspost, I don’t need or give a shit about shwarma blarma - clearly it’s fucking worthless anyway, as I have a decent amount but can’t post in the other subs.
