<p>we do not go back. </p>
<p>We avoid big box stores. We remove ourselves from large banks. We avoid large fast food chains. We shop local. We support businesses in the community. We give back. We get involved in the local and regional governments. </p>
<p>But we do not go back to the ways things were before the MOASS. </p>
<p>And we make sure this never happens again. If that means you take classes or watch YouTube on how to manage money to upgrade your smooth ape brain, then you do it. Hire a lawyer. Hire a money manager, if needed. But keep yourself from becoming them. If a company gets too big for its britches then we avoid like the plague. Nothing drastic. Do not make it your end all, be all. But nothing should be “Too big to fail.”</p>
<p>Be Bruce Wayne and Batman, as needed.</p>
<p>But we do not go back. And we do not become what we have fought so hard against the past 6-12 months. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>Edit: And thank you for the awards. It won’t show who gave all of them, but I appreciate all of them.</p>
