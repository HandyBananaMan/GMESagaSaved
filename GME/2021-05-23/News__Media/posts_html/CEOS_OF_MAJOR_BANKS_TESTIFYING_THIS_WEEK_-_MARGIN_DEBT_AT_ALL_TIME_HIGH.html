<p>Edit 1: Was pointed out that I should include THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS will meet REMOTELY to conduct a hearing entitled, ‚ÄúAnnual Oversight of Wall Street Firms.‚Äù which will include the same bank CEO'S listed below. Here's the link to the live stream:</p>

<p>Obligatory, not financial advice. I'm just a regular ape with no special skills aside from enjoying research and Crayola midnight blue.</p>
<p>I downloaded Duck Duck Go when I saw another post saying Google seemed to be filtering some articles out, just to see what popped up. Low and behold, that post seems to hold up as my obsessive searches about our beloved stock and related information (because you know that I know that you know that it's ALL related) yielded different results on the quack. Sweet, a new rabbit hole to spiral down. And, I'm not saying Google is entrenched with the devil or not. I'm just sayin the articles that popped up were different.</p>
<p>I've had an eye on Finra's reported margin debt. I know this info has been shared before, but the margin debt, or "simply the amount of money that investors borrow from their brokers to buy more stocks", is at higher levels than it's ever been. Higher than when they destroyed us, our families, and our communities in 2008. And the climb to these heights hasn't been slow and steady. It has jumped higher and quicker than my wife's boyfriend when the dog's nose catches him right in the brown star. The Fed has had the money printer on auto-brrrr for quite some time because of the economic impact of COVID-19 which has only amplified the problem.</p>

- This article is on Google as well</p>
<p>Here's an article I think people really should read. It's from last month, but it's insightful, feels unbiased, confirms my bias, and leads me to my final point. The point we've been making for quite some time now:</p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/04/margin-debt-has-exploded-by-49-percent-in-one-year-to-814-billion-the-actual-figure-may-be-in-the-trillions-heres-why/">Margin Debt Article - Debt Possibly in TRILLIONS</a></p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong> read the article you illiterate chimp. Educated ape makes more sound decisions in moments of stress.</p>
<p>The system is on verge of collapse from the tippy top down and the "TOo BiG tO FaiL" mentality has come back with a vengeance from our systematic failures of 2008, when we failed to enforce new rules to prevent this fraud from occurring AGAIN. The hedge funds are leveraged and it's leaking right out of their SHORTS which is where margin debt comes into play. The banks are leveraged to the tits and then some because "Wall Street‚Äôs largest banks are not actually reporting¬†all¬†margin debt that is fueling the sharp rise in stock prices" <em>(sudden gasp for air)</em> üòâ. This is because there are so many different entities that aren't required to report (surprise) this information and er'body be shorten, naked, because it has ALWAYS worked for them and by them, I mean not only the hedgies, but the GD banks too... until now. </p>
<p>My spin: The naked shortening increased borrowing through fictitious collateral (seen in previous DD's), the GME and other stonk HODLer HODLing trapped the hedgies, which increased lending to keep the lid from popping off, which led to more lending because they knew they were fuk'd or that additional lending would give them enough time to convince a bunch of morons who "like the stock" to sell, which led to more lending (because I'm WAY to stupid to sell, can't even find the button) to the point of where we're sitting in a very precarious circumstance in regards to the futures of the global markets.</p>
<p>There's also another nice caveat showing Powell blatantly ignoring our margin debt when directly questioned. J Pow, go home, you drunk. Or, are you trapped? Because you, and everyone else "servicing" the United States PEOPLE is busy covering your asses before you let this thing pop. And ohhhh, she's gonna pop. </p>
<p>The reason I point all this information out is because upcoming House hearings will be featuring the CEO'S of the following banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs who are set to convene in front of The Financial Services Committee THIS WEEK. Here's the info from the committee website:</p>
<p>May 26 at 12:00 PM ET:¬†The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will convene for a virtual hearing entitled, ‚ÄúConsumer Credit Reporting: Assessing Accuracy and Compliance.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>May 27 at 12:00 PM ET:¬†The full Committee will convene for a virtual hearing entitled, ‚Äú<strong>Holding Megabanks Accountable</strong>: An Update on Banking Practices, Programs and Policies.‚Äù¬†</p>

<p>I'm sure these meetings will just be grandstanding and holding each other's weiners BUT in the event they actually touch on some relevant issues, I think these are hearings we should pay attention to. Let's hope they actually HODL those fucking banks accountable and bust out the irons.</p>
