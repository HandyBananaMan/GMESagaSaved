    "selftext": "Now we all know that the price is gonna keep ticking down and down and down constantly as a psychological attack. But what if i tell you that there is more to this than just some psychological tactic.\n\nThis is the most bullish pattern ever, the deathspiral.\n\nNow how does this deathspiral work? Well we all know the day GME went up to $300 not so long ago and IMMEDIATELY in a blink of an eye got crashed down from it. Why? Because that $300 mark would have killed them.\n\nThey lose money everyday and thus the margin call price tag keeps going down and down and down... See the pattern? I haven't seen $200 anymore in a long time.. I wonder why, could that be their new margin call/death call price tag? And now i don't even see $175 anymore... \n\nIt is right in front of our eyes, it is a ticking time bomb. The lower the price the closer we are to the big boom. We are truly in the endgame now. \n\nI salute you all and i will HODL for every single one of you. Generational wealth for even the 0.X apes. No one should miss out on a ride in the rocket to the moon! \n\n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80",
