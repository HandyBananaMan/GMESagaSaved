Just a friendly reminder fellow apes.

They dont need low prices, they need your SHARES.
Shorts must cover as always.
We cant lose unless Gamestop files bankruptcy which never ever will happen.

The lower the price gets, the more shares I can buy which leads to a bigger infinite pool.

The price now doesnt matter at all, dont forget that. We dont have to be above xxx on friday in my opinion. (Yeah I know the OTM and ITM options) 

The rule always stays the same buy and HODL.

America is right now not in a good spot which will probably help the squeeze.
