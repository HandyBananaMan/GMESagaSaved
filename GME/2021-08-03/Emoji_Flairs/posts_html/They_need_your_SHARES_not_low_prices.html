<p>Just a friendly reminder fellow apes.</p>
<p>They dont need low prices, they need your SHARES.
Shorts must cover as always.
We cant lose unless Gamestop files bankruptcy which never ever will happen.</p>
<p>The lower the price gets, the more shares I can buy which leads to a bigger infinite pool.</p>
<p>The price now doesnt matter at all, dont forget that. We dont have to be above xxx on friday in my opinion. (Yeah I know the OTM and ITM options) </p>
<p>The rule always stays the same buy and HODL.</p>
<p>America is right now not in a good spot which will probably help the squeeze.</p>
