<p>Now we all know that the price is gonna keep ticking down and down and down constantly as a psychological attack. But what if i tell you that there is more to this than just some psychological tactic.</p>
<p>This is the most bullish pattern ever, the deathspiral.</p>
<p>Now how does this deathspiral work? Well we all know the day GME went up to $300 not so long ago and IMMEDIATELY in a blink of an eye got crashed down from it. Why? Because that $300 mark would have killed them.</p>
<p>They lose money everyday and thus the margin call price tag keeps going down and down and down... See the pattern? I haven't seen $200 anymore in a long time.. I wonder why, could that be their new margin call/death call price tag? And now i don't even see $175 anymore... </p>
<p>It is right in front of our eyes, it is a ticking time bomb. The lower the price the closer we are to the big boom. We are truly in the endgame now. </p>
<p>I salute you all and i will HODL for every single one of you. Generational wealth for even the 0.X apes. No one should miss out on a ride in the rocket to the moon! </p>
