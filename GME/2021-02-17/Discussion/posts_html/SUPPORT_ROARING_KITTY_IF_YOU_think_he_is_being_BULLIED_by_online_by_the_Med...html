<p><strong>TL;DR If you support Roaring Kitty lets get the right posts pinned and trending to explain to those visitors to this sub now and in the future what the accusations are and the truth about Roaring Kitty.</strong></p>
<p>There is clearly a war being waged against ROARING KITTY before the hearing with all the articles talking about the baseless lawsuits against him being some kind of ringleader and responsible for what has happened, has been going on for weeks, but ramped up last few days.</p>
<p><strong>I am writing this not for the community as many are well aware of the attacks and misrepresentations onslaught - but for any public or media looking at this sub willing to digest more than the narrative from Ken Griffin and Co.</strong> (Edits Feb 18th below pre-hearing comments on Plotkin and Griffin written testimony).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> THE <strong>PREDATORY HEDGE FUNDS SHORTING GME</strong> CREATED THE SHORT SQUEEZE</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT Feb 18th, Plotkin written testimony "<strong>They took information</strong> contained in Melvin’s SEC filings and encouraged others to trade in the opposite direction " <strong>Shall we restrict just Redditors or would you like Michael Burry, Ryan Cohen and the SEC banned from looking at your fund,</strong> so you can keep your mistakes private next time?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> CITADEL AND FRIENDS HAS BEEN SHORTING BRICKS AND MORTAR BUSINESSES, <strong>RESTRICTING THEIR ABILITY TO FINANCE</strong> AND TRANSFORM ENSURING THEIR BANKRUPTCY</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT Feb 18th, OMG Plotkin written testimony claims he is doing the world a favor by extreme shorting , <strong>Papa Elon please call out his BS</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> CITADEL AND FRIENDS <strong>MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY BANKRUPT TRADITIONAL BUSINESS</strong> AND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME ON BUYING THE TECH COMPANIES BY REMOVING COMPETITION</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>4. ROARING KITTY IS A VALUE INVESTOR THAT SHARES HIS DD.</strong> <strong>HE BOUGHT BECAUSE THE SHARES WERE VALUED AT LESS THAN THE COMPANIES BOOK VALUE BECAUSE OF NAKED SHORT SELLING</strong>, WATCH HIS VIDEOS!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>5. MANY MANY OTHER INSTITUTIONS SAW THE SAME VALUE IN GME</strong> STOCK AND INCREASED THEIR HOLDINGS THROUGH DECEMBER - WHY SINGLE OUT 1 RETAIL INVESTOR?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT Feb 18th,  WOW Plotkin written testimony re GME, he still thinks "its business model – selling new and used video games in physical stores"</p>
<p>Ahem... Gabe... Can I call you Gabe? Are you aware of <strong>RC Ventures plans for GME back in Sept 2020,</strong> do you not think you should have reassessed your DD then? <strong>have you heard of Ryan Cohen or Matt Francis?</strong> do you laugh at their stupidity for joining what you suggest is still a dead end business? <strong>is it possible retail investors share their vision not yours.</strong></p>
<p>You say loss making and pandemic is that your extent of your DD? do you consider free cash flow in your DD? Book value? The intrinsic value of gaming communities and GMEs customer base? console cycles? Microsoft Partnerships? gaming experiences and events? a growing gaming market? Guess not.</p>
<p>Do you now think you made a fundamental error in your DD and should in hindsight have reduced your position in Sept 2020 and protected you clients capital, which you have stated is the other reason you short sell. <strong>Are you just jealous of Michael, Ryan and Keiths better DD?</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>6. NAKED SHORT SELLING IS ILLEGAL</strong> - 2 Million GME Fail to Delivers not acted upon by SEC on 28th Jan</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>7. XRT IS NOW BEING USED TO HIDE GME - Failure To Delivers</strong> - through a LEGAL LOOPHOLE in ETFs - XRT 2 Million Fail To Delivers not acted upon 29th Jan</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>8. KEN GRIFFIN AND CITADEL IS THE DEFINITION OF WHAT LURKS IN THE SHADOWS</strong> - THE BREAD AND BUTTER CASH COW FOR NSCC/DTCC, VIRTUALLY OWNS VLAD, hires Bernanke, pays 1M SPEAKING FEES TO YELLEN, significant donations to committee members and republican party last year</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT Feb 18th, regarding Griffins written testimony <strong>no mention of GME</strong> - unsurprisingly the statement focuses on Citadel being too big and important to fail,</p>
<p>"When <strong>others were unable or unwilling</strong> to handle the heavy volumes, Citadel Securities stepped up. On Wednesday, January 27, we <strong>executed 7.4 billion shares</strong> on behalf of retail investors. To put this into perspective, on that day Citadel Securities executed more shares for retail investors than the average daily volume of the entire U.S. equities market in 2019 "</p>
<p>Can you also put into perspective,</p>
<p>- The reasons why others would be unwilling? Did you take on more risk?</p>
<p>- whether you have positions or took actions that influenced the price of, or Citadels exposure to <strong>GME or XTR Failure to Delivers</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> ROBINHOOD FROZE THE MARKET BY ORDER OF NSCC TO ALLOW <strong>STEVE COHEN AND GRIFFEN TO PROVIDE PLOTKIN BILLIONS IN LIQUIDITY</strong> BECAUSE HE COULD NOT COVER THE MARGIN CALLS.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>This way MELVIN DID NOT HAVE TO CLOSE SHORT POSITIONS</strong> and covered his margin while normal everyday investors locked out. They now can use all their combined influence to divert investors away from a transforming traditional business AGAIN so they can profit AGAIN.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT Feb 18th, regarding Plotkins written testimony about closing his positions days before...</p>
<p>Potential Questions to Plotkin and Griffin and Steve Cohen (if he was there)...</p>
<p>- Q1 Do you have any exposure today related to GME share price movements?</p>
<p>- Q2 Are you aware of the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT)?</p>
<p>- Q3 Hypothetically, could i open a position in XRT and not publicly report GME short exposure</p>
<p>- Q4 Did you make or are you aware of any significant moves toward that ETF in Jan?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>YES PLOTKINS APPARENT COMPETITORS</strong> PROVIDED LIFESAVING LIQUIDITY <strong>TO THEIR COMPETITOR! DURING THE RH LOCKOUT. ANTITRUST ANYONE?</strong> with the BS sold to the public about Robinhoods liquidity as the major issue? with a flourish of "to protect themselves from themselves" brilliantly knowing this would mean all eyes and anger on RobinHoods betrayal and not the Sheriff of Nottingham who manufactured it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT Feb 18th, based on Plotkins written testimony <strong>not a bailout? a proactive investment, so your telling me you didnt benefit or need the leverage...</strong> "It was an opportunity for Citadel to “buy low” and earn returns for its investors if and when our fund’s value went up" <strong>Isnt that what many institutional investors were doing with GME?</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>10. Reddit had nothing to do with silver</strong> other than something to point the finger at - Dear SEC, check who was making the fucking trades to drive up $AG the morning it spiked in order to sell the "look at silver" BS to media, for fuck sake seriously! people now think wallstreet bets is JP Morgan? LOL</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With likely none of the media or politicians caring to check his videos out. In case they do come to this sub, <strong>if you agree with this post comment and share! if not please remember the world may be visiting over the next few weeks and months to do their own DD! So share yours :)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>MOST Importantly lets not let Roaring Kitty, a lone retail investor get bullied and made out to be some kinda bad guy, stand up for what you believe, many not part of this sub will not bother to do any more than read the headlines so give them real headlines not conspiracy and ask them to do their own DUE DILIGENCE!</p>
<p>ROARING KITTY LINK - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiO1ITRcjeA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiO1ITRcjeA</a></p>
<p>I think any reasonable person watching him will come to the same conclusion, he is a guy that does his own research, does not hype up shit, and always tells people to do their own DD.</p>
<p><strong>As Roaring Kitty often says - This is just my view and my approach, there are many other ways to assess things, I may be wrong and often am, Do your own research and make up your own mind!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keith Gill is a lone retail investor struggling like many of us trying to earn an honest living and do our best</strong> without the perks of bloomberg terminals, idea dinners, CEOs on speed-dial and cosy relationships with research analysts, newsrooms and journalists.  <strong>link to his own words below</strong></p>
