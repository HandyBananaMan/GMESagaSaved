**Edit: Of course we are all individuals, no one represents us, and we just like the Stonk. But out of all people that could have made the mainstream spotlight he is a true diamond 💎**

A genuinely nice guy who grew up struggling just like the rest of us. Who researched and made his own fundamental investment thesis into a company he liked and thought was undervalued. Actually turned out to be correct against all odds. A thoughtful, smart, and humble guy who represents us APES 🦍 

For those who missed his open written testimony, see link below.
