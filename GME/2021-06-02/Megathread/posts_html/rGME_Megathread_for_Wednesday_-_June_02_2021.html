<ul>
<li>Good Morning/Night 🦍s, sorry for the late update, 🦍s please welcome u/freesmiles54 and u/Ren3666 to the mod team, they are here to assist with Spam, Reports, Misinformation, and Breaking of sub Rules, so please make sure to report posts/comments so Mods can address your concerns.</li>
<li>So we've seen reverse math via Etoro and Korean data of shareholders, heres some share ownership maths via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nngt4p/crosspost_gme_ownership_analysis_528_hedgies_r_fuq/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Mergent FTSE Russell Data</a> and via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmv8p0/for_the_curious_wondering_how_many_shares_we/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Bloomberg Terminal</a> calculating 114 Million shares in retail/🦍 hands and 153-174 Million shares sold respectively, and that's just the reported numbers who knows how much bigger it is.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np4wwu/etoro_got_their_15_of_all_gme_holder_straight/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">calculation for Etoro</a> has come <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/npcczs/etoro_misinformation_etoro_does_not_have_13m/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">into question </a> so now the maths showing between 6.4 Million shareholders in 1 claim and 80 Million on another the contention is how Etoro calculates it's "x% of investors, investing in X stock" and there's still question if the numbers etoro uses for overall share holders came from gamestop or not, luckily we have other sources of information (pointed out above).</li>
<li>Since data is so hard to nail down here's another "glitch" showing a GME price of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/np2jmi/glitch/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">about 25k</a>, speaking of price for the younger 🦍s here's a <a href="https://gmefloor.com">handy website</a> if you have to ask about a floor. Here's some more useful information with logic of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nod5c9/floor_after_taxes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">doubling your floor for taxes</a> and some math using fidelities 500% increase limit above share price showcasing how quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnbqqj/from_512_to_1000000000_in_ten_steps_using/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">the price could move</a> (Market Halts not included) and here's an excellent explanation of a Margin Call, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn6g4r/understanding_the_margin_call_why_it_does_not/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">how covering isn't immediate</a>, 🦍s already know what's up as far as waiting for Hedgies to pay (💎🙌)</li>
<li>🦍s another friendly reminder that Kenny <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn5lnl/well_someone_doesnt_want_it_going_past_230_again/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">isn't playing fair</a> and thats not the only thing to worry about. There have been a few posts about How <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mulstf/cointelpro_techniques_for_dilution_misdirection/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Hedgies Infiltrate, and spread misinformation</a>, here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmacz0/the_social_media_war_its_time_for_ape_boot_camp/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">social media company Kenny uses</a> to control his false narratives. There isn't just shills but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnjrhq/g_m_e/gzuydmg?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">scammers</a> as well so remember to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/no5hjg/secure_your_accounts_before_moass/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">protect your accounts/information</a>.</li>
<li>To end on a good note here's another hedgie is going down from 700 million to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn9zca/the_renaissance_period_ends_aka_another_hedge/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">250 million in assets</a> dropping like a rock, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnxz1e/remember_ken_griffin_still_wants_to_wipe_out_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Protecting Gamestop jobs</a> is another benefit of HODLing 💎🙌 and to close a little Meme/Premarket <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/no9m4r/a_little_premarked_hype_video_i_put_together/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Hype Video</a>.
