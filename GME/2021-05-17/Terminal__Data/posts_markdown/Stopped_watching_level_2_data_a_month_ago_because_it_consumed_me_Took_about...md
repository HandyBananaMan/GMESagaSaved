#Title: Stopped watching level 2 data a month ago because it consumed me. Took about 5 minutes today and watched the epic battle on this 35k share sell wall at $175. It kept bouncing off and then charging back. It finally blew through it all the way to 176.xx. I forgot how cool that was to watch! Bullish AF
