If we substract that from the outstanding shares we get 29,137,640 shares left. This is only the top institutions that own > 5% of the company. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/), there are a total of 310 institutions holding GME at the moment. We should also include the [2,478,117 shares owned by insiders](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.59.0). Subtracting that from our total leaves us with **26,659,523** shares. This is not even counting over 300 institutions and retail investors and we\u2019re already almost out of shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWE OWN THE FFTING FLOAT !!\n\nHEGGIES ARE FUCKED DEEP IN THE ASS!\n\nCONGRATS EVERYONE!  BUY, HOLD AND VOTE !!\n\nNot a financial advice  :)\n\n[https://advancedplays.com/gamestop-files-14a-sets-date-for-stockholder-meeting-reveals-massive-institutional-ownership](https://advancedplays.com/gamestop-files-14a-sets-date-for-stockholder-meeting-reveals-massive-institutional-ownership/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I thought I included the link but guess not lol",
