I'm planning to vote in person and came across this  !

**Institutional Ownership**

* BlackRock, Inc. – 9,217,335 shares
* RC Ventures LLC – 9,001,000 shares
* The Vanguard Group – 5,162,095 shares
* Senvest Management, LLC – 5,050,915 shares
* Maverick Capital, Ltd. – 4,658,607 shares
* Susquehanna Fundamental Investments, LLC – 4,409,467 shares
* Dimensional Fund Advisors LP – 3,934,919 shares

That adds up to 41,634,138 total shares owned by these institutions. If we substract that from the outstanding shares we get 29,137,640 shares left. This is only the top institutions that own > 5% of the company. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders/), there are a total of 310 institutions holding GME at the moment. We should also include the [2,478,117 shares owned by insiders](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.59.0). Subtracting that from our total leaves us with **26,659,523** shares. This is not even counting over 300 institutions and retail investors and we’re already almost out of shares.
