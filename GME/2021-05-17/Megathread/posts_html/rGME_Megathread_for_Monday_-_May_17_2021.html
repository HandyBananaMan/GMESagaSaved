<li>We had a SEC Whistleblower Friday that was supposedly debunked and unrelated to GME, the debunking was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nch64x/oooooooooooooooooooooooweeeeeeee/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">debunked here</a>, it was also reinforced that RC may really be the whistleblower 🚀🚀 with potentially a smoking 🔫 of vote counts exceeding float/issued shares (its Speculation but dam plausible considering all that went on Thursday/Friday).</li>
