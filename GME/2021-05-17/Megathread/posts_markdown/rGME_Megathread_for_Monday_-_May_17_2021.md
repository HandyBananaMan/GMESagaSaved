This is a place to discuss technical analysis, fundamental analysis, buyer/seller sentiment, \*\*and all things relevant to GME.

New Mod Announcements:

* We had a very busy weekend with a Warden Fall out on Superstonks ( [please maintain comments about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/) it has the full explanation of the situation and also counters to Warden traditional sell on the way down tactics at the bottom).
* We had a SEC Whistleblower Friday that was supposedly debunked and unrelated to GME, the debunking was [debunked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nch64x/oooooooooooooooooooooooweeeeeeee/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), it was also reinforced that RC may really be the whistleblower 🚀🚀 with potentially a smoking 🔫 of vote counts exceeding float/issued shares (its Speculation but dam plausible considering all that went on Thursday/Friday).
* We also had an [intresting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ncyj6e/dont_blindly_click_on_links_during_moass/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) about internet safety for the less tech savy 🦍s. I will try to update this more frequently with important updates along with other daily pinned threads that are important. I hope your 🦍 weekends were restful, now get ready for another exciting week of the price is wrong 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀.
