<p>If you don't know what I am talking about, see my post from yesterday. I predicted the closing price and now I'll tell you, why <strong>I think</strong> we closed around that mark!</p>

<p>I: GME is on the SSR since yesterdays price drop. What is the SSR Rule? The short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. That means they can only short on upticks. But not on downticks. What happens when they short on upticks? Nothing. They did that the last few days, the price dropped $10 - $15 and immediatly recovered a few minutes after. People also bought every dip, making it look like there is no way out for Shitadel &amp; Friends now.</p>

<p>II. People kept asking me yesterday, that if it really was the long whales triggering the SSR, why yesterday and not today? Here is what I think: They needed to trigger the SSR yesterday, because without the price drop, GME would've launched yesterday by EOD. They had to drop the price in order to get GME on the SSR for the rest of the day and for today. If I am correct with my theory, they will  definitely do it today as well, in order to have GME on the SSR for the rest of the week.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT2: I actually fell for fake news and should've stayed with my own thoughts. The SSR is NOT(!!!!!!!!!) triggered yet for tomorrow, I will edit this post back accordingly! People posted lots of links, but non of them were official links. The only official link I could find was from the SEC. And the SEC themselves say:</strong></p>

<p>III. There was an additional buying of Options instantly after the drop to $172. Between 30,000 - 60,000 additional options were purchased over the course of a few hours. Most of them @ 300, 350, 400 and 800. If you take a close look at the price movement from the past few days and yesterday especially, there weren't any abnormally large purchases in a short amount of time. That tells us, that MM's still need to buy shares in order to guarantee the execution of call options. With the additional call options from yesterdays buying spree, that would make for 5,000,000 - 10,000,000 Shares having to get bought for hedging from the past few days.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Gamma goes brrrrrr today/tomorrow  ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€. Long Whales prepped the SSR for today and stocked up on a lot more options in the meantime to make sure, this will be an actual Gamma Squeeze no one has seen before. Shitadel isn't allowed to short on downticks today. <strong>So what IS going to happen today</strong>? I think we open below $238.50 (SSR Trigger) or drop to $238.50 Intraday, in order to trigger the SSR for tomorrow as well. If we drop to that price mark and the price bounces back immediatly with almost the same volume, that's how you know it was done on purpose. But even if the SSR doesn't get triggered for tomorrow, we're ready for liftoff. ðŸš€</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean the Gamma Squeeze will happen today? Likely, but not certain. As soon as the SSR trigger is active for tomorrow, they have time until tomorrow EOD, to make sure this thing takes off. If it doesn't drop to $238.50 today, I think the Gamma Squeeze will start by EOD at last.</strong></p>

<p>That price action also fits my Endgame DD theory, of the Gamma Squeeze taking place this week in order to trigger the Short Squeeze next week. If you haven't read the Endgame DD or the Updates, feel free to do it now. Quote:  "TL;DR: <strong>MY Conclusion</strong>: The squeeze is inevitable. It got delayed many times, but no matter what data you look at, the outcome is always the same, everything points to this specific date. Also: Other Hedge funds smell blood. They can take out some of their biggest competitors as well as making billions and billions of dollars in the process. There couldnâ€™t be a bigger win win situation for them, than this one. <strong>I think the squeeze is starting a few days, maybe even a week prior to March 19th. I think that itâ€™ll start March 15th and build up all the way to March 19th</strong>, where the real rocket takes off. How long is it going to last? I donâ€™t know, no one does. But I think itâ€™s going to last for at least one week. Of course, itâ€™s going to get more and more expensive to buy in over time, so you donâ€™t want to miss out. As always: Buy and Hodl"</p>
