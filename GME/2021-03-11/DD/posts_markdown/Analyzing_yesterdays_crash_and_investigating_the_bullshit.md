So guys, yesterday, we had a bumpy ride.Although anyone of you should be able to understand that growing steadily to $346 and then crashing in minutes back down to $178 isn't normal...lets look at what actually happened.

Understanding will strengthen your diamond hands, which is necessary, since in order to be able to make smart financial decisions you need to be able to remain calm, clearheaded, no matter what you are seeing on your screen.

Figure one starts at 12:21. At this point we have already dropped from 340 tot 302, however I started with this since it gives us a really nice insight into what happened on a level 2 basis of these trades.In this figure I put down numbers for reference.

If you look at .1, you can see a very large order for $302.68, .3 shows that 303.12 was the lowest other price available, .2 tells us the amount of shares being sold for this price. A WHOPPING 21.58k. Doing this on ANY stock would crash it. Tesla, Microsoft, you name it. You can literally force any stock in the world to crash if you so violently pull out the bottom..

&#x200B;

![Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/ub8buzrwiem61.jpg?width=423&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98b1e8c41de315a66c50624078d7a5b4cceb61aa)

In figure 2, we can see the effect the previous attack has had. We've now dropped down to 248.68 after the halt. The short attack isn't over however. So another big order stream comes in for $248.68 at a whopping 18.57k size. This means we're going to drop again.

&#x200B;

![Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/s2kmiph0jem61.jpg?width=428&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3dbe9cfe5995e1c1e07edc6b30c88a5c554e644)

This is only seconds later. You can see they weren't satisfied with the amount the share was dropping. They didn't want to take any chances. They WANTED you to freak the fuck out, and decided to turn it to 11. The dump size for 248.68 increases from 18k to an idiotic 42.17k! This means that this order is worth $10.5 million dollars. Guess what happens next?

&#x200B;

![Figure 4](https://preview.redd.it/1gdq77d2jem61.jpg?width=433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56b0d3a455007a5707af9748ee4c7a969aa05740)

That's right, we freefall again. We're now at $216. As soon as the markets open after the halt, they are determined to make it drop more. Another low order is being inserted, to the tune of 44.21k! They really want this bitch to crash more. Another $9.5 millions worth is dumped and we immediately crash to a low of $178. This is the point were you were panicking, and were you either panic sold, or your STUPID (trailling) stoploss limit kicked in. A minor victory for the shorts if you did.

&#x200B;

At this point some big whales are starting to wake up. We don't know who this are and the options are endless. All we know for sure is that a very big party is gobbling up shares here.

* Could be the same party that dumped. They just dumped a very high number of shares to crash the stock. If you're short, that means you don't have enough shares to begin with. That's why shares are loaned. However if you don't return them you did achieve to crash to stockprice but you dug yourself an even deeper hole! They could be trying to claw back whatever wasn't stolen by people buying the dip. Buying the dip therefor makes their problem bigger
* Could be a long institutional whale. This little stunt plummeted their share value and portfolio. They're not taking kindly to this and they return fire by spamming massive buy orders to grab shares and push the price back up.

&#x200B;

In figure 6 whoever is this, they're not having any of it, and they're going all out. They show they too can turn the dial to ELEVEN. They're buying up all the shares with a high bid to the tune of 27k or $5.3million

Check the timestamp. The effect of all this buying is quite clear. We've shot back up to $260+.Unlike normal investing, the price means NOTHING anymore in this stage. They can make it go anywhere they want. The price however does not reflect the reality anymore.

The short positions that have to be covered CANNOT be gauged from the price day-to-day. You need to understand this, so please READ ALL THE DD YOU CAN FIND. There have been excellent explanations of the situation and unless you understand it you are prone to making bad financial decisions.

# Can you check this in real time?

Yes! There are excellent resources for this! I know not everyone has a bloomberg terminal in their home, but you can check what's called level 2 orderbooks in realtime on Youtube!

This is the livestream that contains yesterdays trading in FULL.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d57zOGhrfk&t=20853sT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d57zOGhrfk&t=20853s)This video shows yesterdays trading day. The crash starts shortly after 4:54:13. I encourage you to watch this back in real time, so you can see what happened. If you want to see the whole crash and recovery, keep watching until 5:30:07. You can see how manipulated yesterdays crash was.

# How do I know the game is still on?

Calm down friend. We need to inform you, to make you able to make better financial decisions for yourself.

* *Did the shorts cover?!*No... . I've seen people freaking out about this constantly.You CANNOT cover short positions by selling. Only by buying. Buying the amount of shorts outstanding would probably make the price rocket. The shorts (the only ones with motivation to crash the stock) dumped large amounts of shares in order to dump the price. This means they have to buy at least those back or they'd be worse off than before the crash. I think it's likely the big buying party is NOT the same as the one dumping but more on that later.
* *Was this a large whale that exited and left us to fight alone now?!*Highly unlikely. If you want to unload a a large number of shares, you're doing so for profit right?How do you profit from just throwing them all out in the open, crashing the stock and destroying your own potential returns.... You dont.. If this was a large whale exiting they would have done so gradually. The ONLY reason to dump this amount of stock into the market is to crash it, cause panic and to hope that you can buy stock for cheap from paperhands who suddenly give up their shares or by triggering stoplosses. (And yes, if you have a stoploss they KNOW about it. This information is sold to them by brokers like RH)
* Can they do this again?!You bet you ass they can. And they will. That's why it's important that you understand what is happening. If you do not understand you will make poor financial decisions. It is not in your interest to sell at low prices when a share is clearly worth more than that!

# Why does Damsellindistress THINK the dumping and the buying party are two different entities?

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2asru/death\_throes\_dd\_the\_secgovernment\_cant\_intervene/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2asru/death_throes_dd_the_secgovernment_cant_intervene/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

The chart shown here and the excellent explanation by Broviet very clearly indicates two large entities trying to make eachother back down with extremely violent bids and counterbids. This doesn't make sense if it was the same party doing this.

# Why would someone do this?

Well what do you think. We have massive evidence of short positions. This means that they are in desperate need of shares. More than exist even. They need everybody who has shares now to sell, sell, sell. How could you potentially achieve this? Well maybe you could dump a few shares and see if they are stupid enough to panic and sell? Is this illegal and market manipulation? For sure. But their alternative is certain death and potentially the biggest financial wealth transfer ever in the history of mankind.

They can try to scare you out of it but lets hope they don't succeed.

# Can this happen again?

YES! Diamond hands isn't just some cute little emoticon combination. It actually means something.They are risking EVERYTHING here, so they will do ANYTHING (illegal or not) to try and get out of it.

Personally I have over 50k on the line. I said goodbye to that money. Just as an emotional safety measure. Is it money I can afford to lose? Yes. Is it money that I want to lose? Hell no!

Many of you are already with your minds in the Lambo dealership. Not only stupid, but also a bad idea. This makes you emotionally vulnerable. Gains and losses are NOT REAL until the moment you cash out. Do not fall in love or get desperate at the sight of red or green. It doesn't mean anything. They can make the price do anything they want to until the squeeze happens.

If this all does go tits up for some reason, then I'm going long on this investment.Cohen and his team are doing so much to increase the value of this company.I've accepted the worst case scenario, that I'll be stuck in this investment for 2 years until GME achieves a $200+ valuation based on fundamentals. This is ofcourse a gamble, not advise, but investing money ALWAYS is.

# TL;DR

No. Come on. Inform yourself. Read this post, you NEED to understand what is happening in order no to panic or at least make the best possible decisions. Let's just say the main take away is this. We are at war. Someone is frightened to death that the shareprice will go over $350 it seems. Maybe there's a little margin call hidden behind it? Who knows. However, the question is.... do you want to let yourself get intimidated by this? Or do you see it for the manipulation and smoke and mirrors that it probably is?

Stay calm, don't panic. Fake crashes like these will recover.
