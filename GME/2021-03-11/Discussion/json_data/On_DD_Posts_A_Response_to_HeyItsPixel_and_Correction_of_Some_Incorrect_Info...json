Gamma Squeeze today. Likelyhood: \"Likely, but not certain\" Reality: Might've been likely, certainly wasn't certain. This did not happen today, so\n2. If not #1, then once we hit the SSR list again then Gamma Squeeze tomorrow by EOD. Likelihood: Unknown. Reality: Gonna have to see tomorrow! If you're certainty on this is 100% then there are a lot of really cheap FDs you can buy right now that'll print if you're right.\n3. If we don't hit the SSR limit for tomorrow, then Gamma Squeeze will start EOD at \"last\" (I assume this is \"latest\"). Likelihood: Unknown. Reality: This piece is unclear to me because it doesn't necessarily follow the previous logic. E.g. we could not hit the SSR list but still Gamma Squeeze tomorrow, right? Or is this strictly tomorrow only if we don't SSR, meaning this also didn't happen? Would need clarity to know. We didn't gamma today, so presumably that means tomorrow.\n\nThat makes it sound less certain than it is though! One of those 3 realities has already collapsed, and the second two r**equire a gamma squeeze to happen tomorrow.** Not 3/19. Not 4/16. Tomorrow. No other possibilities are given weight or time, and there is no assessment of the nature of the gamma squeeze and what holders might expect if it does happen (300? 400? Moon in the reaview?). Again, I have misgivings about this approach I won't go back into here. Posting this so you can laugh at me tomorrow when I'm wrong!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2: Not as dispassionate as I'd hoped, sorry gang. If you read this thinking I hit the white and wanted to take out a big figure in the sub, you'd be wrong, but I understand your perspective. I like and appreciate u/heyitspixel analysis. I agree with much of his general sentiment, as I say below multiple times. I've tried to clean up some of the factual disputes to make them more readable with point-by-point tl;drs. They're still longish, sorry; shit is complex.\n\nUltimately though, I stand by my point: hype posts that misrepresent facts are dangerous. They don't have to say \"buy right now!\" and they don't have to be intentionally malevolent to cause harm. This is a huge forum that thousands of people read every day. People expect accuracy and honesty from the figures they elevate. **They deserve that - you deserve that.** I like the stock. I don't like \"zomg 60k OI change moon confirmed gamma squeeze definitely today or tomorrow.\" If that happens it won't matter that I didn't like it or that someone said it would. A bunch of you, myself included, will make a shitload of money. But if it **doesn't**, it will **absolutely matter**. If you don't see why, buy a bunch of 300/400C for tomorrow and see how you feel watching the price move. You'll get to mock me if my temperance was unwarranted!\n\nEDIT: Ultra tl;dr: Read DD closely and don't assume facts and figures are correct. Pixel's posts today and yesterday mistake Options Volume for Open Interest multiple times, and essentially all of his OI figures are incorrect. 60k OI increase is wrong. 20k OI increase in a few hours is wrong. Anything that posits a specific timeframe in which options were purchased is wrong. Strike prices he analyzes change between posts. These pieces are fundamental to his analysis over the past couple days, and they are all bullshit. I have no idea if this is a genuine mistake or not and think you should look into it before assuming GME Nostradamus is all-knowing.\n\nI made this as a comment but am becoming increasingly confident that it ought to be a post. Because of that, I'm adding some intro from the original comment at the top here. Please read the whole thing - I'm not out to get anyone, I personally am long GME, I like the stock, and I have high hopes for its immediate and long-term future. I also know people make decisions based on posts like this, whether the author intends or accounts for that behavior. I think prominent posters need to be extremely careful and cognizant of this reality. Using phrases like \"this is what happened\" and \"the squeeze is definitely happening on x date/by y time\" is extraordinarily irresponsible. If you personally believe that, then I applaud your conviction and hope you'll temper it when interacting with others who may see your zealousness and mistake it for certainty. None of this is certain, and acting or implying that it is will have real world consequences for real people. Please consider the weight of your words. Thanks and <3.\n\nHere's a tl;dr of what I'd post if I were gonna give advice or offer my opinion on the stock, using my own advice on how to do that at the bottom of this post:\n\n>I like GME. There is obviously a lot of retail and institutional interest in this stock right now, and that interest seems to exist after the big rise and fall of January. That leads me to believe that the longs are resilient and won't settle for 'just' big gains. The people want blood. Yesterday's drop and rebound lends more credence to that idea. The high Open Interest in OTM calls lends credence to that idea. There is a lot of money at stake in this stock, and I think it can and will go higher than the 200s its been bouncing around today, because of a combination of technical factors folks have discussed in other DD posts, positive sentiment, and most importantly for me a huge well of positive news potentially breaking in the near future (Cohen CEO, Q4 earnings, DTCC rule changes, DFV YOLO posts, just to name a few).  \n>  \n>I do not like putting numbers on guesses, because it implies a level of certainty that doesn't exist outside my own brain. Telling you that I think GME has IMO, say, a 55% chance to hit 400 by EOD tomorrow doesn't provide any insight beyond you now knowing a bit more about how my brain is broken, and being able to see if I'm right or wrong tomorrow. It also oversells the upside - even if I'm right, there's a huge 45% chance it goes down! And that downside? Could be anywhere, potentially. Are you ready to watch your shares drop from 250 to 190 again? What if they dropped to 100? Are you really gonna hold, or is that loss gonna make you puke and paper hands real hard? Are you certain of what decisions you'll make based on your own personal assessment?\n\n# You have to be honest about these possibilities. If GME is going to the moon no matter what, then fuck me right? Who cares that I told you to be careful, I'm not your dad and you can safely ignore me and call me a dipshit. If GME is going anywhere else, then please be careful. Please risk Vegas money, not YOLO money, if you can't handle the potential downside. Please don't bet your life on this. I love ya.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOriginal comment text, on Pixel's post today:\n\nu/heyitspixel made improvements in transparency in his today, which make me somewhat happier! \" **If I am correct** with my theory, they will definitely do it today as well, in order to have GME on the SSR for the rest of the week.\" This is a good way to let people know that you aren't certain and I'm glad to see this change in tone from yesterday.\n\nHowever! He's still conflating Volume with Open Interest and it's driving me nuts man! **VOLUME IS NOT THE SAME THING AS OPEN INTEREST. THEY ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS, AND YOU CANNOT COMPARE THE TWO UNTIL THE OI NUMBERS ARE UPDATED THE NEXT DAY.**\n\nSo in his post today he kinda does a two-step to make it seem like hus bold 60k+ prediction yesterday was correct, when it wasn't even close:\n\n\"Between 30,000 - 60,000 additional options were purchased over the course of a few hours. Most of them @ 300, 350, 400 and 800.\"\n\nLet's examine why this is incredibly misleading:\n\n1. You have no idea when exactly options were purchased, beyond the day. Open interest in options is updated after close and will only show net increases/decreases from the day before. There are no hour-by-hour OI stats. Telling people that this event happened \"over the course of a few hours\" is only true if you mean \"the entire trading day.\"**TL;DR 1: There is no public database which shows at what time specific options were bought and sold. Open Interest represents the latest figures as of yesterday's close, not an hour-by-hour breakdown. Volume is an aggregate of buys and sells and includes some new writes, some closures, and some trades.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Yesterday your big post focused on the 300-400 strike prices, and you hypothesized that \" SOMEONE WANTS THIS SHIT TO MOON REALLY BAD AND LOADED UP ON OVER 30,000 - 60,000 ADDITIONAL OPTIONS BETWEEN $300 and $400, EXPIRING FRIDAY MARCH 12TH. (Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET) That is an increase of another 20,000 Calls from just 10 Minutes ago!\" This was untrue and caused by you, again, misreading volume as open interest increases. Here's what actually happened: 300-400 strike call open interest increased from \\~19k on 3/9 to \\~30k on 3/10. It could be anywhere today and you cannot know for sure until the numbers are updated after close. The actual increase here was \\~11k from strikes 300-400. Not 20k, not 30k, not 60k. 11k. Why does it matter? Because today the target has moved! You now are including the wildly large Open Interest at the 800 strike because it inflates the total number of open contracts and makes it seem like you were correct about the 300-400 prediction yesterday. The 800 strike calls alone increased by \\~7k (from 22244 OI at open on 03/10 to 29496 OI at open today) - that could be due to genius IQ ultra-high-level plays, or it could be explained much more simply as degen gamblers buying up cheap 800 strike calls when the price flatlined for a second. Neither of us knows why, and I find both explanations to be compelling. You don't mention the second explanation in either post. Why?**TL;DR2: There was indeed an increase in OI yesterday. It's magnitude is overstated both in yesterday's post (\\~60K+) and todays (40-60K+) due to confusion of volume with OI. Today's post looks at 300-400 and 800 strikes (\\~20K increase in OI yesterday) and fails to analyze other strikes before coming up with 40-60k figure. 800 strikes are as likely to be YOLO gambles as a concerted effort to gamma squeeze. 800 strikes did not figure into yesterday's DD at all, which means they weren't important yesterday even though they have had >20k OI for weeks now.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. How can you not provide an exact figure of additional options purchased yesterday? Was it 30k or 60k? We know that \\~11k is attributable to increases in the 300-400 strike range, and based on the optionistics site it looks like the 800 strike increased by 7252 (from 22244 OI at open on 03/10 to 29496 OI at open today). That's a total of a hair <20k. Where do you get the rest of that insane range from? I can only attribute a bit under 20K in OI changes to the 300-400 and 800 strike prices. There's no chance 40k additional contracts were opened at other strikes, so I have no idea where you get the upper part of that range. 30-40k in total might be reasonable, across all strikes, I don't have time to look through the full chain right now, but trust me I will!**TL;DR3: The figures used throughout the post flip between generic and specific, and this makes it difficult to interrogate what is fact (300-400, 800 strike OI increased 20k) and what is conjecture (40-60K OI change). I do not believe the upper range of that figure (60K) is accurate, and question why a person doing this level of analysis would take a guess here instead of posting the actual figures. This is not due dilligence.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. So your 30-60k number is maybe 30k-40k in new OI since yesterday. It's not 60k. How many shares would those new strikes entail, if they all come ITM and get exercised? (I find this possibility to be extremely unlikely, as a lot of contracts would get sold instead of exercised in order to retain some of the insane IV value and because it's unclear if all 800 strike buyers can afford to exercise a contract that costs 80k, but let's go with it). Using your high 60k change in OI, this would equate to 6 million new shares needing to be hedged vs. yesterday. This is, again, only true if these options end up ITM by tomorrow, and only true if your wild figure that has no basis in factual reality is real. If these strikes aren't ITM, MMs will not fully hedge any of them, and they may in fact already be hedged given that their deltas were all higher yesterday than they are today. You have no idea how many more shares need to be bought, if any, because you aren't making these markets. It could be 1 million, it could be 6 million, it could be 0. If these go ITM, I would agree that the gamma squeeze potential is higher since OI is also higher, and that MMs will need to buy additional shares to hedge these increased deltas, but anything else is conjecture.**TL;DR4: Today's post follows yesterday's in guessing about OI increases intraday. This is again conflating volume with OI. We will not know if and by how much OI changed today until after close. Today's post additionally posits that a gamma squeeze is imminent today or tomorrow to cover the additional OI yesterday (real) and today (assumed). The author has no idea if and by how much Market Makers have already hedged these strikes. The author fails to address existing Delta hedging, and fails to address that delta on all of these high strike calls was higher yesterday and therefore some hedging has already occurred. Market makers do not have to wait to hedge. They might be doing that for the 800 Calls because they're so far OTM. No one but the MMs themselves know these exact numbers.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Remember - as of this post none of these new options are ITM, not even those 300-400 strike ones, so MMs are not fully hedging any of them at this point. Delta on the lowest of those, 300, is \\~.34 as of this moment (this will change wildly with price swings but go with me). That means the 300 strike calls are already \\~1/3 hedged. The 400 strike calls have a Delta of \\~.14 (same caveat) so are \\~14% hedged. The 800s sit at a delta of \\~.02, so they could theoretically be naked, but again the 3/12 ones are currently way OTM. This means that, even if the price rockets to 300/400, there is no guarantee that the additional hedging will cause the price to hit 800 and then the moon. It seems likely that that *could* happen, but again with the 11k increase in 300-400 strike OI, this is a maximum of 1.1 million new shares to hedge on that OI increase, if the calls go ITM. That number is not, in fact, 3-5 million.**TL;DR5: Even if MMs are underhedged on these OTM options, it will not actually matter until those strikes move closer to ITM. Even if that happened, there is no way to be certain that it would propel the price to any specific point. A gamma squeeze could occur at e.g. 300 that pushes to 350, or pushes to 400 and squeezes up to 600. It could push to 100k. It could be that we never get close to these strikes being ITM this week and the guaranteed gamma squeeze doesn't happen at all.**\n\nI could go on but this shit is getting tiresome and too long so here's the tl;dr #2: you and other smart people need to stop doing this shit. You need to be more sober in your analysis and more frank and clear in your presentation of data and your conclusions. If you want to be seen as someone with insight, you need to say \"I think ABC will happen, because of the following factors. It's possible that doesn't happen. If it doesn't, it will likely be because of X, Y, or Z risk factors I identify below. This is an unprecedented situation, and while some predictions can be accurate, we won't know exactly what will happen and exactly when it will happen until it does.\"",
