    "selftext": "When I was a boy in Bulgaria, my mom would read me the following poem before going to sleep at night. I thought the rest of you apes may find it soothing as I did.\n\n>Twas the night before MOASS, when all through the market,  \nNot a news outlet reporting, only pumping silver and Rocket.  \nThe call options had been bought, for their gamma with care,  \nIn hopes that the Tendie Man soon would be there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The autists were nestled all snug in their beds,  \nWhile visions of green dildos danced in their heads.  \nAnd my wife out with her boyfriend, and me alone in my cap,  \nI settled down for a long winter\u2019s fap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When in my portfolio there arose such a clatter,  \nI knew it was hedge funds with a short attack ladder.  \nAway to the Reddit, I flew like a flash,  \nAnd there bots and shills, shitposting all kinds of trash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The red on the breast of my new-fallen shares,  \nGave me temptation to sell to the bears.  \nWhen what to my eyes should emerge from the fog,  \nBut DFV in a Lambo, pulled by three tiny hedgehogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"On, Citron! On, Melvin! Onward, Citadel!  \nI own the stock and I ain\u2019t heard no bell!  \nTo the tops of the chart! And over the sell wall!  \nI like the stock! I like the stock! I like the stock all!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A bundle of tendies he had flung on his back,  \nAnd he looked like an alpha ape with a huge nut sack.  \nHis diamond-hands, how they twinkled! His giant balls, how merry!  \nHis cheeks were like roses, his headband like a cherry!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He spoke not a word, and gave no financial advice,  \nI couldn\u2019t give AF anyway, because I set my own price.  \nBut laying his finger aside of his nose,  \nAnd giving a nod, up the stonks rose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He sprang to his Lambo, not once having sold.  \nNow it\u2019s up to me, to buy and to hold.  \nI heard him exclaim, as my account became fat,  \n\"Happy Tendies To All, and To All: I Am Not A Cat!\"\n\nEdit: formatting/spelling\n\nEdit 2: Some of you seem to think I am suggesting a date. I don't know anything about that. This is just a poem my Bulgarian mother read to me every night - just in case. Maybe you'll share it too someday with your loved ones every MOASSiversary eve.",
