<p>When I was a boy in Bulgaria, my mom would read me the following poem before going to sleep at night. I thought the rest of you apes may find it soothing as I did.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twas the night before MOASS, when all through the market,<br />
Not a news outlet reporting, only pumping silver and Rocket.<br />
The call options had been bought, for their gamma with care,<br />
In hopes that the Tendie Man soon would be there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The autists were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />
While visions of green dildos danced in their heads.<br />
And my wife out with her boyfriend, and me alone in my cap,<br />
I settled down for a long winter’s fap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When in my portfolio there arose such a clatter,<br />
I knew it was hedge funds with a short attack ladder.<br />
Away to the Reddit, I flew like a flash,<br />
And there bots and shills, shitposting all kinds of trash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The red on the breast of my new-fallen shares,<br />
Gave me temptation to sell to the bears.<br />
When what to my eyes should emerge from the fog,<br />
But DFV in a Lambo, pulled by three tiny hedgehogs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On, Citron! On, Melvin! Onward, Citadel!<br />
I own the stock and I ain’t heard no bell!<br />
To the tops of the chart! And over the sell wall!<br />
I like the stock! I like the stock! I like the stock all!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bundle of tendies he had flung on his back,<br />
And he looked like an alpha ape with a huge nut sack.<br />
His diamond-hands, how they twinkled! His giant balls, how merry!<br />
His cheeks were like roses, his headband like a cherry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He spoke not a word, and gave no financial advice,<br />
I couldn’t give AF anyway, because I set my own price.<br />
But laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />
And giving a nod, up the stonks rose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He sprang to his Lambo, not once having sold.<br />
Now it’s up to me, to buy and to hold.<br />
I heard him exclaim, as my account became fat,<br />
"Happy Tendies To All, and To All: I Am Not A Cat!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: formatting/spelling</p>
<p>Edit 2: Some of you seem to think I am suggesting a date. I don't know anything about that. This is just a poem my Bulgarian mother read to me every night - just in case. Maybe you'll share it too someday with your loved ones every MOASSiversary eve.</p>
