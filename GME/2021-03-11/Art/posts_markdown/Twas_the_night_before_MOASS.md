When I was a boy in Bulgaria, my mom would read me the following poem before going to sleep at night. I thought the rest of you apes may find it soothing as I did.

>Twas the night before MOASS, when all through the market,  
Not a news outlet reporting, only pumping silver and Rocket.  
The call options had been bought, for their gamma with care,  
In hopes that the Tendie Man soon would be there.

&#x200B;

>The autists were nestled all snug in their beds,  
While visions of green dildos danced in their heads.  
And my wife out with her boyfriend, and me alone in my cap,  
I settled down for a long winter’s fap.

&#x200B;

>When in my portfolio there arose such a clatter,  
I knew it was hedge funds with a short attack ladder.  
Away to the Reddit, I flew like a flash,  
And there bots and shills, shitposting all kinds of trash.

&#x200B;

>The red on the breast of my new-fallen shares,  
Gave me temptation to sell to the bears.  
When what to my eyes should emerge from the fog,  
But DFV in a Lambo, pulled by three tiny hedgehogs.

&#x200B;

>"On, Citron! On, Melvin! Onward, Citadel!  
I own the stock and I ain’t heard no bell!  
To the tops of the chart! And over the sell wall!  
I like the stock! I like the stock! I like the stock all!"

&#x200B;

>A bundle of tendies he had flung on his back,  
And he looked like an alpha ape with a huge nut sack.  
His diamond-hands, how they twinkled! His giant balls, how merry!  
His cheeks were like roses, his headband like a cherry!

&#x200B;

>He spoke not a word, and gave no financial advice,  
I couldn’t give AF anyway, because I set my own price.  
But laying his finger aside of his nose,  
And giving a nod, up the stonks rose.

&#x200B;

>He sprang to his Lambo, not once having sold.  
Now it’s up to me, to buy and to hold.  
I heard him exclaim, as my account became fat,  
"Happy Tendies To All, and To All: I Am Not A Cat!"

Edit: formatting/spelling

Edit 2: Some of you seem to think I am suggesting a date. I don't know anything about that. This is just a poem my Bulgarian mother read to me every night - just in case. Maybe you'll share it too someday with your loved ones every MOASSiversary eve.
