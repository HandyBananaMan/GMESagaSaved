    "selftext": "Good morning San Diago,\n\nI am Rensole,\n\nI told you to expect fuckery now didn't I?\n\n\\*insert flashy intro card\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uz1dch641dm61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af8c1ae9a8ffc73fee393f55c92ff07c1321684\n\nNone of this is financial advice, this is all my personal opinion.\n\n# wtf happened yesterday?\n\nOk so lets get a few things clear before moving forward.\n\n1. this was not individual retailers selling off, this was a \"Flash crash\" [more info on it here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flash-crash.asp#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Flash%20Crash,minutes%2C%20resulting%20in%20dramatic%20declines)\n\nWe saw about 500.000 shares sold and no one buying.\n\n2) this was premeditated, this was planned.\n\nHow do I know? because I was already saying this would happen for days.\n\nplus some news outlets did a fucky wucky and posted this before the crash happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The first trading halt going down was at 12:41:05](https://preview.redd.it/760ivl8x1dm61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c07278a389323400fd787d590e1c6a00903e3da)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[article posted within 2 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/g211piu82dm61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b40eb8b121352e53f9f61f98de945e571235b090)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Marketwatch even did it a lot earlier ... which is impressive](https://preview.redd.it/rpg5u9qc2dm61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5986a834b56191d17f352f2d9324bc765293b3d5)\n\nSo like I said yesterday, they're trying to pull the rug out from underneath us and start to spread FUD. and they did alright, we had so many bots we kicked off the board since that happened.\n\nLike clockwork the amount of bots and shills coming on just then and there where immense.\n\nat the same time lots of trolls / hater/bots/shills came out on twitter to say \"I TOLD YOU SO YOU SHOULD SELL\"\n\nSeriously Kenny, Melvin if you're watching, if you let the stock go down I see this as discounts and just in time for salary / stimmy's... you 2 do love us dont you <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48kwyfo73dm61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97b3e56444c7f04af29136fe272ab430418617bf\n\nAlso I'd love to bring attention to the chart from yesterday, I'm not a professional so to me it looked like a... wtf is this?\n\nsome explanation can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m28dqw/can\\_someone\\_explain\\_the\\_last\\_price\\_column\\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m28dqw/can_someone_explain_the_last_price_column_here/)\n\nBut it seems to me as I see the reactions of other people... yeah this is what is the thought across the board as they either claim this is impossible or have never seen anything like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8hg2rcqladm61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1c97a77186ceb1ddf37d750aa6fbbac17be4fbf\n\n# why was 350/400 so important to get it bellow that?\n\n[u/AcedVector](https://www.reddit.com/user/AcedVector/) did a great writeup yesterday on why this price is so important for the shorts.\n\nWe all have been wondering for a while why now? why around this exact point did they choose to do this?\n\nwell remember those FTD's? they're fairly low right now right?\n\nand also the Short amount went from 240% to what? 30%? ok so they hid this, the question is, HOW?\n\nwell it seems they took the \"kick the can down the road\" idea very literally, they hid them in in deep ITM options. give his article a read it gives a good explanation on how this works and how they did it.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2bhl8/why\\_the\\_400\\_mark\\_is\\_important\\_and\\_how\\_it\\_explains/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2bhl8/why_the_400_mark_is_important_and_how_it_explains/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptfdxirr3dm61.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d02b3a9204e27398817a4672b52c718775039dc\n\n# Garryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!\n\nMadlad Gensler is getting appointed today!\n\nSeriously guys stfu and stop hating because he worked with Obama, yes we get it Trump bad Obama bad Biden bad. we don't care it's not about politics here so stfu.\n\nWhy do I have so much respect for this motherfucker?\n\nfor one his head is brighter than my future, second do you know who made laws so hedgies can't pull the same trick they did in 2008? this motherfucker.\n\nHe made the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, this law basically said oh you did what? swaps? these fucking things aren't regulated? one sec fam I got you.\n\nAnd this guy spat in the face of everyone and just went and legislated this shit so hard that you probably haven't heard about swaps in a long time. he is known for giving zero fucks and doing what he thinks is right. not what the corporations think, no what HE thinks is morally right.\n\nSo yeah this is one of the few people in politics I like enough to share a beer with, maybe even a meal... call me Garry <3\n\n[https://www.congress.gov/nomination/117th-congress/80](https://www.congress.gov/nomination/117th-congress/80)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hodl boys Hodl](https://reddit.com/link/m2mnvw/video/3j4p0tv45dm61/player)\n\n# 100.000 a share\n\nA lot of people have suddenly started talking about this being outlandish, funny how the fud campaign started yesterday with this, the flash crash AND the media all coming together, wtf is this Melvin's A-Team?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1waof/this\\_is\\_why\\_gamestop\\_wont\\_stop\\_and\\_why\\_100k\\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1waof/this_is_why_gamestop_wont_stop_and_why_100k_is/)\n\nI'm gonna be very simple in a few of the most asked questions.\n\nQ: Why would they pay it?\n\nbecause no one else seems to want to sell for lower so they have to buy them.\n\nQ: Who is going to pay me?\n\nJust like when I sell my piece of shit car, Idc who pays me or how they get the money, this stonk is like my pos car, I set the price and they can get my shares for whatever I value them.\n\n# Some tips:\n\nOk so I've noticed a growing fear of what we should do \"just in case reddit black out\".\n\nSo here are some tips about that.\n\nfirst read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2asru/death\\_throes\\_dd\\_the\\_secgovernment\\_cant\\_intervene/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2asru/death_throes_dd_the_secgovernment_cant_intervene/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nit's why the Government most likely wont intervene anymore at this point.\n\n**1) back up DD**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2bgsj/advice\\_for\\_when\\_the\\_squeeze\\_happens\\_make\\_sure\\_to/gqia964/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2bgsj/advice_for_when_the_squeeze_happens_make_sure_to/gqia964/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\n**2) make sure you are connected.**\n\nFor me the easiest way of this would be saying... Twitter? my twitter is @ Rensole and I'll try to back up most of my work on external sites today, most likely tumbler or blogspot or something not sure I'll have to look into it but once it's updated i'll post it here as well.\n\n**3) stop losses**\n\nDo you have a Stop loss in? If your brokerage sells your information to people like Citadel, they knew where they were your stop loss was and they took advantage of it yesterday, so for the love of god remove the meme stop losses, just set your price to wherever you really want to sell and nothing else.\n\n4) But how will they pay us?\n\nSeriously shut the fuck up, if I'm selling my house, my car or even one of my crayons IDGAF where they get the money, so why worry now?\n\nI don't care if they have to dig up Jesus and make that fucker pay.\n\nit's simple, they need our shares, and I set the price for my own shares, and after yesterday it's no longer 100k it's more.\n\nBut is the company worth, shut the fuck up.\n\nEither you believe in this and you're in this or you're out, and I rather have paperhands leave asap and leave this up to the Diamond Hands because then I don't have to deal with the same questions over and over, if you have a question ask, but FFS there is a search function, use it.\n\n# If you're unsure take a step back and look at the bigger picture\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[this is the chart of 2021](https://preview.redd.it/opsxs911bdm61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=c90c1673f9fbb909f8a385786603932c8a90d9a5)\n\nthat's a big ass cup and handle\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What to keep in mind today.\n\nThese assholes where quiet, too quiet for the past few days and they tried to kneecap us yesterday.\n\nBut the most important thing to keep in mind is simple, they tried to drop the price by as much as they could yesterday, and they couldn't. hell we even ended up 10% up in the green.\n\nSo expect them to try everything they can just like yesterday, expect fuckery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's also good to keep in mind is the psychological aspect of this, as this is a war of the mind.\n\nI've written 2 posts about this and linked them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lea7pg/the_psychological_aspects_of_all_the_things/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lemt4r/psychology_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you will also be seeing in the next days/weeks to come is a term called **\"price anchoring\"**\n\nPrice Anchoring is a simple concept, people say X price is good or talk about X price.\n\nLet's take GME for example, anyone posting 1K as a good price anymore is either a bot a shill or a fucking retard, they are trying to make you comfortable with the 1k price so you'll be mentally conditioned to think \"oh yeah they said 1k was good right?\"\n\nso let's start throwing out some big numbers, my floor price is 100.000 and 150.000 this looks better than saying 100k or 150k, lets start using big boy numbers, that way when Melvin and Shitadel read this they can understand it.\n\nthe next few days are going to be turbulent, they're going to get rough, but I wouldn't expect anything less from them.\n\nThese are the death throes of a trapped animal, so expect it to fight back.\n\nExpect them to do illegal things, expect them to try and get inside your head.\n\nBut most importantly don't forget that we are a community if you have troubles speak out, and other members if you see someone not understanding something, help them, give them resources and links so they can learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mosjrrr1edm61.png?width=344&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d5b500e0eeb5664dc1f082e8256459e243a4d04\n\nAlso I heard these things are making a comeback! and it's awesome to hear can't wait to see all the billboards again loved them last time gonna love them more now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htnodwp7edm61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffb4b6a95f5edf63f8cf6081e6e1e58a1736b1fe\n\nIf I have forgotten anything feel free to let me know I'll add it bellow here\n\nAlso as always none of this is financial news, I'm actually retarded enough they took my rounded scissors away :'<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:**\n\n**I'm noticing shills commenting FUD and quickly removing their usersname.**\n\n**If you see a shill and tag me or one of the other mods, also include their user name so we know who to ban ;)**\n\nEdit 2:\n\nSet dates\n\nPlease please PLEASE guys, chill about the 19th.\n\nDo not set hard dates, it will happen when it happens. We don't know for sure when the squeeze will be here, what will set it off or around what specific dates.\n\nRemember this is a public forum and anyone can view this, so expect Melvin/citadel to have at least a few people browsing this.\n\nTherefore do not think March 19th is a SET date, dates hold no value, the squeeze does.\n\nSo be level headed and expect fuckery, if everyone says the 19th (or any date) is the date you'll only be setting yourself up for disappointment, let this happen naturally. this is part of mentally preparing you.\n\nEdit 3:\n\nBacked up all my Dailies here: [https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/](https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3:\n\nBecause some apes seemed to forget about certain dates\n\nMarch 17th is when the house financial services hearing continues\n\n[https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/02/172654-house-financial-services-committee-game-stopped-part-ii-scheduled-for-march-17th/](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/02/172654-house-financial-services-committee-game-stopped-part-ii-scheduled-for-march-17th/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe GME meeting  is the 23rd\n\nAs is the Q4 earnings report.\n\n[https://investor.gamestop.com/home](https://investor.gamestop.com/home)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 4:\n\n**Yes its me <3 thx chat**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 5:\n\nBecause people asked about the psychology stuff here is the link:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lemt4r/psychology\\_2\\_electric\\_boogaloo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lemt4r/psychology_2_electric_boogaloo/)",
