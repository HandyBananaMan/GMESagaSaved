Given all the theatrics of the past couple of weeks, some might be a bit addicted to the adrenaline and feel like no news is bad news, it's not.  The plan of shorting GME yesterday, coordinated with the media onslaught of only bad news articles, was meant to cause a panic.  It did not.

With GME on the SSR list today, hedgies were hoping there would be a retail sell-off in hopes bananas would fall down from the banana tree. This would allow them to cover their short positions without having to come up the banana tree to buy them from us apes.

Well...it didn't work.  Once they realize that it didn't work they will have to start closing short positions again by searching for bananas up in the tree...the more we hold, the taller the tree gets and the higher those shorts will need to climb to buy bananas.  

It's that simple...rinse and repeat.

This will only stop when they realize they no longer can pay to shake the tree or that the tree is full of apes that won't drop any more bananas. Then and only then will they start climbing indefinitely, to try and buy as many bananas as possible as quickly as possible so they can mitigate their losses as quickly as possible.

This may happen tomorrow...this may happen next week...this may happen a month from now..but it will happen, and all us apes have to do in the meantime is hold our bananas and enjoy the view from our slowly growing tree, and if some apes see falling bananas, let's just grab them before they hit the ground.
