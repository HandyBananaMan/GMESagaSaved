This don\u2019t make any sense to me.... sounds like something is odd\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/us-judge-u-turns-on-ruling-in-overstock-digital-dividend-lawsuit\n\nNow I\u2019m even more confused, so they are gunna fight in court again it seems.\n\nMy Counter to the above: game stop has the rewards program and game coin, they historically have always used exchange of value of games in trades like an exchange. So I would think they should be more than fine, it\u2019s always been in their business model and GameStop previously paid a dividend so it\u2019s not new grounds for them to enter into. However with overstock it was something completely brand new to them, so I could see it as kind of an issue. But companies are meant to grow and evolve, if you don\u2019t you get replaced. They can\u2019t stay a certain way just cause the guy shorting the stock says \u201coh but your company only does this\u201d business is always chAnging, you either pivot and survive or you stay the same like a fool and die. My opinion.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nCould GME be the second coming of dividend issue resulting in short squeeze\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nMaybe Ryan will give us a crypto dividend like overstock did For their shareholders \n\nLink provided by Rem in comments below\nThanks Rem u/reminiscetoy\n\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/overstock-short-sellers-fall-short-as-judge-gives-digital-dividend-claims-short-shrift\n\n\n\n\nLink provided by Walk, apes Walk presents to you all u/walkingdadjokes Thanks Walk\n\nGAME-COIN\n\n1 coin = 1 dollar\n\nhttps://www.gamestop.com/collection/game-coin\n\n\n\nLink provided by Dia thank you Dia\n\nu/diamondseeker2020\n\nCoin on crypto pro (you can search it on there as GME)\n\n(Link Deleted) Yekim has mentioned this coin is actually a fake \u2018shitcoin\u2019 that took the GME name in 2013. It isn\u2019t the official one. Thank you\n u/teamyekim \nYou are more then welcome to search it to see for yourself, however keep in mind it appears to be a fake. Writing this here so we keep it transparent and correct. Should you feel the need to question no biggie just post below.\n\n\nApes this is who I found out about Overstock from Furn u/furnitureman80085\n\nLook at Furns post\nAlmost 5 months ago thank you Furn\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jgfa1m/ostk_and_gme_a_quick_story_about_my_first/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nalso Tesla incorporated as well crypto today and their stock jumped \nLink provided by u/daronjay thanks Daron\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/crypto/bitcoin/tesla-stock-token-binance\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCounter Argument asked poster if I could post they said yes so long it\u2019s anonymous \n\n\u201cjust an opinion\n\nThey can make a token\nThey can give you that token\nBut holding that token isnt mainstream\nSpending, saving it isn\u2019t ubiquitous \nIf it\u2019s a cash equivalent it can add complexity\nSo you go from everyone with cash being a potential investor, you go to folks that understand this and are willing to do this \u2014 possibly risking a stigma \nSo a stock that could go to 10, looms at 5\nthe banks just said fuck it \u2014 cash equivalent is fine\nThey don\u2019t need to go around the whole system \u2014\n\nMoreover \u2014 given the press; it may not even be necessary \u2014 because it\u2019s much easier for a short seller to do just target another stock if they\u2019re not playing by the rules\n\nAt their size and scope \u2014 let someone else be the pioneer, that\u2019s big enough to facilitate change. It\u2019s really really hard to drive this kind of user adoption, those resources are better used elsewhere \u201c\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThought it would be fair to post another view point. Which has its points as well.\n\nAnyways in conclusion\nI then just connected the dots like an ape following bananas \n\n\nPlease place your opinion below it\u2019s very important, so we can get a general idea of everyone\u2019s view points\n\nThank you to everyone who helped with the info \nI kept updating as different info tied to it came up",
