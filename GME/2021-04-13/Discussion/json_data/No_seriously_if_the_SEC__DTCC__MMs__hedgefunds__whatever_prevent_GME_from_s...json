    "selftext": "I'm sick to the stomach will all of this. The blatant price manipulation, the media manipulation, the lack of regulatory policing or enforcement. It's pathetic and infuriating, disheartening and disillusioning. A total breakdown of trust in this Market. \n\nI am waiting with my shares for the system to work as it should. If the system fails in this, I will disengage completely and go somewhere else.\n\n I will not be a little piglet for slaughter.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Even if there is a \"controlled squeeze\", if things go back to business-as-usual, I'm out. What retail investor in their right mind would want to participate in such a rigged system? There's got to be some huge-ass change before I feel anywhere near comfortable reentering this shit show.\n\n\nEdit: FFS stop giving me awards and buy more GME\n\n\nEdit: I apologise if this comes across as FUD. It's not meant to be, I'm just angry at what I've witnessed on the past 3 months and I want my sentiments to be heard. I am hodling on for dear life waiting for the squeeze to squoze",
    "title": "No seriously, if the SEC / DTCC / MMs / hedgefunds / whatever prevent GME from squeezing I will remove all of my investments from the US stock market, and any person I encounter who is even remotely involved or interested in investing there I will actively discourage and warn them not to do so.",
