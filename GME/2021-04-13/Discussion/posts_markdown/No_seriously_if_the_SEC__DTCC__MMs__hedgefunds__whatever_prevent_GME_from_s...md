# Title: No seriously, if the SEC / DTCC / MMs / hedgefunds / whatever prevent GME from squeezing I will remove all of my investments from the US stock market, and any person I encounter who is even remotely involved or interested in investing there I will actively discourage and warn them not to do so.

I'm sick to the stomach will all of this. The blatant price manipulation, the media manipulation, the lack of regulatory policing or enforcement. It's pathetic and infuriating, disheartening and disillusioning. A total breakdown of trust in this Market. 

I am waiting with my shares for the system to work as it should. If the system fails in this, I will disengage completely and go somewhere else.

 I will not be a little piglet for slaughter.




Edit: Even if there is a "controlled squeeze", if things go back to business-as-usual, I'm out. What retail investor in their right mind would want to participate in such a rigged system? There's got to be some huge-ass change before I feel anywhere near comfortable reentering this shit show.


Edit: FFS stop giving me awards and buy more GME


Edit: I apologise if this comes across as FUD. It's not meant to be, I'm just angry at what I've witnessed on the past 3 months and I want my sentiments to be heard. I am hodling on for dear life waiting for the squeeze to squoze
