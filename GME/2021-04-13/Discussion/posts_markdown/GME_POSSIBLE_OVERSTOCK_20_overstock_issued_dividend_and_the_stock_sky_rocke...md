Nothing written here is financial advice. I mean read my username. 


Edit just found this, how do you categorize that as a mistake? This don’t make any sense to me.... sounds like something is odd

Now I’m even more confused, so they are gunna fight in court again it seems.

My Counter to the above: game stop has the rewards program and game coin, they historically have always used exchange of value of games in trades like an exchange. So I would think they should be more than fine, it’s always been in their business model and GameStop previously paid a dividend so it’s not new grounds for them to enter into. However with overstock it was something completely brand new to them, so I could see it as kind of an issue. But companies are meant to grow and evolve, if you don’t you get replaced. They can’t stay a certain way just cause the guy shorting the stock says “oh but your company only does this” business is always chAnging, you either pivot and survive or you stay the same like a fool and die. My opinion.

Could GME be the second coming of dividend issue resulting in short squeeze

What do you all think?

Maybe Ryan will give us a crypto dividend like overstock did For their shareholders

Coin on crypto pro (you can search it on there as GME)

(Link Deleted) Yekim has mentioned this coin is actually a fake ‘shitcoin’ that took the GME name in 2013. It isn’t the official one. Thank you
 u/teamyekim 
You are more then welcome to search it to see for yourself, however keep in mind it appears to be a fake. Writing this here so we keep it transparent and correct. Should you feel the need to question no biggie just post below.

Counter Argument asked poster if I could post they said yes so long it’s anonymous 

“just an opinion

They can make a token
They can give you that token
But holding that token isnt mainstream
Spending, saving it isn’t ubiquitous 
If it’s a cash equivalent it can add complexity
So you go from everyone with cash being a potential investor, you go to folks that understand this and are willing to do this — possibly risking a stigma 
So a stock that could go to 10, looms at 5
the banks just said fuck it — cash equivalent is fine
They don’t need to go around the whole system —

Moreover — given the press; it may not even be necessary — because it’s much easier for a short seller to do just target another stock if they’re not playing by the rules

At their size and scope — let someone else be the pioneer, that’s big enough to facilitate change. It’s really really hard to drive this kind of user adoption, those resources are better used elsewhere “
