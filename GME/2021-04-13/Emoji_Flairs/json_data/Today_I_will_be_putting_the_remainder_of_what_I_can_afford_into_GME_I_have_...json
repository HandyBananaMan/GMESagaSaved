    "selftext": "After today, I\u2019m maxed-out on how much I can afford to buy. Which is fine. I started with 2, and some how ended up with way more. \n\nBut I\u2019m not going to be shaken from my position. After I buy today, I\u2019m not opening the charts up again until my phone alerts me that price is moving up fast. \n\nThe squeeze will happen, it\u2019s only a matter of time. There is no sense in getting myself all worked-up watching the daily charts and risk a stupid/tired/whatever decision that will cost me my bounty.\n\nFor those of you who think you might fall prey to price manipulation and drops, I suggest not looking at it either. You won\u2019t miss the squeeze.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve got alerts set-up all the way to $10M, but the $1k alert is a good indicator that the squeeze is under way. I have the $1k alert set on TradingView, as well as all three of my brokerage accounts; I'm not missing it!",
