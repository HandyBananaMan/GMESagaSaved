After today, I’m maxed-out on how much I can afford to buy. Which is fine. I started with 2, and some how ended up with way more. 

But I’m not going to be shaken from my position. After I buy today, I’m not opening the charts up again until my phone alerts me that price is moving up fast. 

The squeeze will happen, it’s only a matter of time. There is no sense in getting myself all worked-up watching the daily charts and risk a stupid/tired/whatever decision that will cost me my bounty.

For those of you who think you might fall prey to price manipulation and drops, I suggest not looking at it either. You won’t miss the squeeze.

Edit: I’ve got alerts set-up all the way to $10M, but the $1k alert is a good indicator that the squeeze is under way. I have the $1k alert set on TradingView, as well as all three of my brokerage accounts; I'm not missing it!
