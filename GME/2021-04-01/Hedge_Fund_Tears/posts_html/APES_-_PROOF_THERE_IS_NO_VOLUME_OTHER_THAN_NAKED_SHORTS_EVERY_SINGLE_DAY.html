<p>If I'm wrong then I accept permanent ban.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> From what I learned from smarter apes who reached me is that this situation is not as simple as I described it below. There are many methods to hedge against sold puts used by market makers, and other methods of shorting the stock without actually borrowing shares on the market. So I'm sorry for oversimplifying and of course will accept banishment if that helps the community. BUT: The main thought of the post is valid, and although <strong>I made a quantitative mistake</strong>, qualitatively it's ok. If one looks at the chart just at the beginning of a session there was a big sell order and the amount of shorted stock corresponds to put options - and these have to be hedged by the market maker. By a naked short or other way. So the title should be "<strong>MAJORITY OF THE VOLUME SOLD ARE NAKED SHORTS</strong>". I won't stop here and will grab all my crayons to dig into this deeper. It's feasible and worth work. As u/socalstaking said**: "it would ease a lot of the collectives anxiety and stress".** The main thing here is that we have a tool to show unaffected unity and immense strength. In other words: <strong>wouldn't we all be calmer when we're shown accurate real number of naked short trading each day?</strong> I'm yes and we can get there. <strong>END OF UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>I read DD by u/broccaaa about naked short selling scheme via married puts. Take a look. As of writing this total PUT open interest for completely irrelevant prices like 0-20$ is 18636 which makes 1863600 shares naked shorted by the market maker!</p>

<p>And the daily volume up till now is \~1974000.</p>
<p>STOP thinking that there is something happening. There is just yet another day of digging the hole. But also - STOP, I BEG YOU, STOP THINKING THAT THE PRICE MOVES BECAUSE SOMEONE SELLS. The only shares sold are naked shorts by market maker to be even with the ridiculous PUTs it sells!</p>

<p>EDIT: PLEASE! Realize how we are now in FULL CONTROL, we can easily calculate and justify any price movement, amount of shares sold. No one is selling! This is the most important thing - it's a proof that we stay in line and always did, there were no renegade apes. Whenever in doubt - go back, calculate, and eat a banana.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: it leads me to a conclusion that any share you are buying is counterfeit, and it was happening for a long time already. Counterfeit means only the fact that the share was created out of thin air by market maker right before it was sold.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: ~~by counterfeit I mean totally awesome because it's better than buying real stocks. It means they are above 100% shares outstanding. A special ones which won't be covered unless you, and only you decide to sell. After an infinite squeeze of course. From the Vega system.~~ I don't even know what I wanted to say here, but can't find a way of expressing it without bullshitting, so I deleted it.</p>
<p>EDIT 4: I may need to recalculate everything by the end of the day (and accept the ban if I'm wrong), because what matters is the day of when option is sold, not expired. And people report that there is some retail trade ongoing, so the title may be misleading, should be "there is little volume compared to the naked shorts". Or "less". I apologize, I wrote this while being very excited. I don't think we need a "total" bias to get where we want, will update the post at the end of the session. Anyway - it's still true, there is a way to quantify naked short volume easily, and it's huge.</p>
