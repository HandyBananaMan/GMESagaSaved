<p>Can we please try to get Michael Burry, the OG ape, to do an AMA on this sub. I know he said back in 2009 that no one came to interview him about how he knew about the 2008 crash, but now there are 258k+ apes that would love to throw bananas at his feet and find what goes on in his amazing brain.</p>
<p>Not financial advice, ape just wants to learn.</p>
<p>And of course, shout out to all the apes doing amazing DD on this sub, thank you so much for teaching me loads and opening my eyes to how f*cked up the world is.</p>
<p>Obligatory <strong>ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</strong></p>
