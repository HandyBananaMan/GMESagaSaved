I know he said back in 2009 that no one came to interview him about how he knew about the 2008 crash, but now there are 258k+ apes that would love to throw bananas at his feet and find what goes on in his amazing brain.\n\nNot financial advice, ape just wants to learn.\n\nAnd of course, shout out to all the apes doing amazing DD on this sub, thank you so much for teaching me loads and opening my eyes to how f\\*cked up the world is.\n\nObligatory **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**",
