<p>If we hold the float, and IF we don't paperhand and sell early, the price rises. It's as simple as that. We have the supply, and there is demand. </p>
<p>Personally, I'm here for life changing money. Can I benefit off of 10k? Sure. 100k? Yeah, that'll pay off my student loans. </p>
<p>1 MIL? That'll keep me financially free for the rest of my life, along with my family and future children. So please hold. </p>
<p>We came here together as a group of apes, I want to leave here with apes that are millionaires. These hedgies scoff at millions, so fuck them. Hold because of the fuckery they pulled, and HODL for the fellow ape to the left and right of you. </p>
<p>We're all passing each other at grocery stores, not even aware that the man or woman next to you has 💎👐's. Don't let them down. </p>
<p>I'll see you all on the 🚀🌑</p>
<p>Edit: The floor can have as many commas as you want, as long as you buy and hodl. 1Mil, 10Mil, etc. </p>
<p>Just hodl for all apes and yourselves</p>
