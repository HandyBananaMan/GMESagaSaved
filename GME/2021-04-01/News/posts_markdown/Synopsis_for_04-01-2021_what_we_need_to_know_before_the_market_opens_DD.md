Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

Kenny phone call, it's from Asia...

\*insert flashy intro card\*

none of this is financial advice.

First let's get some things out of the way, tomorrow is "Good friday" this means that tomorrow the markets will be closed.

[https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=Calendar](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=Calendar)

This means that today is the last day of trading of this week.

# FTD numbers

I'd like to thank  u/SituationGoood for posting this for us.

&#x200B;

[the numbers Mason...](https://preview.redd.it/2lcdz4m6yiq61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f9fe008de51fbd88a0c86e0e5e8f77d6683b00)

as you can see it's still cyclical so it seems their MO has not changed

and like always... this just means to stay the course hold and go on.

# The ETF rebalance

These are the ETFS that rebalanced yesterday. I have not had time personally to check out if any of these had GME in them, so sorry for that.

Some comments have said that there are where no GME in these

# Fake reddit messages

Also something that seems to be cropping up is a new shill tactic of sending people on here fake messages acting like they are from reddit themselves.

Remember these are not messages from reddit themselves and if you receive these kinds of messages you should report them to reddit themselves immediately

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sf6p4vmhziq61.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d1e24f987bbe1fbd48ae99cdf8f934fecf76be5

Remember Reddit staff will never ask you to take any monetary action, or ask you to liquidate any holdings. because this is none of their business.

If reddit chooses to end your account or ban you, you'll get banned. its never followed with "but if you pay X" or "if you sell X" this is not how Reddit functions

&#x200B;

Please take these emails for what they are, phishing attempts and trolling.

it's either a couple of idiots having fun, or a new paid shill tactic, however it's still scary to receive for some.

# WHY ARE WE YELLEN? LOUD NOISES

So as some people who where paying attention around 2010 may know there used to be a hedgefund oversight committee called FSOC.

(Financial stability oversight counsel)

This counsel was started during the Obama administration to asses the risks certain hedgefunds posed to the market, this was last used in 2016, and now out of nowhere, us Treasury Secretary Yellen announced that she is reviving it and immediately held a meeting about it.

# The Short problem

So I was also tagged in something which I don't know what to exactly make of it.

**Addendum: links removed because op was banned multiple times with multiple accounts at different times in the past weeks, pure ban evasion so wont link it.**

I have zero contacts in Hong Kong, let alone stand the FUTU Securities.

But I would remiss to not have mentioned this, due to FSOC being reinstated and the leniency that the banks had due to covid ended yesterday. meaning this could very well be true, but should not be treated as such until we are able to 100% confirm this one.

If anyone here has contacts there, please use them and help us stay informed if this is true or not, because this could very well be either true or a april 1st joke or a troll thing.

We don't know for sure.

But this expands, because I have seen other people post about how they also had trouble buying stonks in western brokers, but again we need confirmation on these things.

# The Argos fund

In the past week I've been seeing a lot of people talk about Archegos and what happened to them.

well our fellow ape  u/dontfightthevol did an article about it which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhe40h/what_happened_with_archegos_total_return_swaps/)

Give it a read because this explains how they where able to do what they did without having so much scrutiny.

&#x200B;

if you also weren't aware we are doing an AMA with Ms Goldstein this Friday

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfxbm/official\_ama\_alexis\_goldstein\_friday\_april\_2\_11/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfxbm/official_ama_alexis_goldstein_friday_april_2_11/)

Funny thing to mention surrounding this is that this is costing the banks billions, and guess what our favorite Dr Burry put on his twitter?

The big short in Japanese... got to love that man

# Remember you have options

ok this has been said over and over, don't touch options until you know every aspect of how options work and how this stuff can impact you.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mha8v8/for\_the\_love\_of\_god\_stop\_buying\_options\_and\_doing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mha8v8/for_the_love_of_god_stop_buying_options_and_doing/)

at this point it's been stated so many times and people have not been able to discredit these explanations so I believe these hold merit to at least check out.

[now starring Kenny and Melvin](https://preview.redd.it/mwchxeo17jq61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa8cfb352e3deacc440ccea689dcdcf47e89e499)

# Wen CEO?

Ok so some people have been asking (including me) why hasn't RC stepped up as CEO by now?

Most of us expected him to step up and be voted in before the earnings call or shortly after that due to Sherman was, quite literally, phoning it in.

well we seem to have overlooked something really important, namely vesting.

u/commentsonyankees did his first DD and we are thankful for that because well he thought of something we all overlooked, you can read his write up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfqa2/current_gamestop_ceos_vesting_schedule_2_weeks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

The current CEO, George Sherman, is on a vesting schedule and due to receive roughly 84,000 shares on April 15th. The board could be waiting for this day before announcing Ryan Cohen as the new CEO. this would also line up with the date that the shares will have to be recalled for the annual shareholders meeting (not sure when these will be recalled but it will happen somewhere in april).

This is not to set a date for us, but this is the date for Sherman, he has incentive to stay on the board until that date, so it may very well be that there has already been some internal discussions and an agreement has been made with him to let him stay so he can receive those shares and then peacefully transition to someone else, hopefully RC.

And even if it takes until the annual shareholders meeting to be announced, who cares right? we are the generation that stood outside in the cold for hours waiting to be the first people who got their hands on Halo 3 at the midnight release, or COD or the new gaming rigs.

Remember we have more patience then you might first realize, just chill and let the good times roll baby.

# Think or Swim

Ok this is the news from last night from Think or swim app.

lets put these things in perspective

* Yellen says climate change is a problem for financial stability
* s&p futures go low
* FSOC is reinstated and has a meeting the same day
* US president to deliver remark on economic vision

I'm not entirely sure what kind of picture this is supposed to paint so I'll leave it with you guys to make up your own mind as always

Ok as always I like to end the week with some stuff that I can't or wont TLDR.

if you have the time give these a look

I have to caveat the "everything short" and "naked shorting scam, selling nude like 2021" I've looked into both but could not personally vet these completely, but as always you should doublecheck yourself anyway, even my work. always.

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.

Edit 1:

it seems that the thing about shorts being unavailable on Interactivebrokers is not a glitch.
