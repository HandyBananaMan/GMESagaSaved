<p>Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen became a billionaire thanks to insider trading. How is he not in jail? On top of insult, he bailed out Melvin Capital and is allowed to buy the NY Mets. </p>

<p>I finished watching this Frontline documentary and was flabbergasted to learn that only the people working under him were found guilt and sentenced to prison. In one instance, Steve Cohen literally tells investigators that although he opened an email with insider information, he didnâ€™t pay attention to the screen right before executing a criminal trade! </p>
<p>The same guy bailed out Melvin Capital when Individual investors were beating Hedge Funds fair and square:
