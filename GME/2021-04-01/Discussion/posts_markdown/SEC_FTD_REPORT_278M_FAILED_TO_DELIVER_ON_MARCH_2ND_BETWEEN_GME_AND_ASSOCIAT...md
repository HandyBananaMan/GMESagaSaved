**HOLY SHIT!!!**   **I THINK THIS IS HUGE**.

first, i built [this tool](https://failedtodeliver.com) to help sort through the sec ftd info.  its completely [open source](https://github.com/failedtodeliver/failedtodeliver.com) so no funny business ... feel free to contribute if you think its useful

importantly, for you smooth brained apes, how does this work?  line items from the sec report are compiled by day and by stock(s) merging their notionals (price at the time \* quantity) together to get an overall lens of the damage.

and if i built this right and im correct here, then if you look at this link below, you can see the combined notionals for GME and associated ETFs
