Can you sense it? Can you Feel that electricity in the air; smell that blood in the water; hear those 🚀 rocket engines 🚀 rumbling? I know I can.

Don't succumb to a prisoner's dilemma because it's falling from 1K, 10K, even 100K and you want to multiply your stake once its settled. That's the whole point of the fake short squeeze. They know they can't actually fool anyone into thinking the squeeze has truly squoze, but they can try and bait apes into selling to increase their stake, creating an opening to floor the price and close their positions.

If you need a selfish reason - which I know you don't because we're all true, committed apes here - you'll have to pay tax on those gains. Then, if it doesn't murder the MOASS in the crib, you'll have to pay tax on gains from that too.

Don't think "oh well if everyone holds it won't matter if *I* sell and buy back". If everyone does that we're fucked and the shorts win. Don't be cute, don't screw other apes trying to be greedy, **DON'T** paperhand thinking that you're being a clever daytrader.

Just clench your diamond fucking hands no matter what. 💎🙌 So long as we hold, we literally set the price.

Apes. Together. Strong. 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍

This is not financial advice, I just like the stock.
