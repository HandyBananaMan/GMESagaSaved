These last two months, the enemy has not made sense to me.  They keep digging a bigger and bigger hole. A hole that goes nowhere. They could have covered  their positions for a bargain at $40 in February. But they shorted more.  and more and more and more.  And not just GME, XRT and all the rest.

Why?  What sense does that make? Why keep digging a hole?  There's no escaping. Where's the business sense?

Then the Everything Short came out.  ^^I ^^skimmed ^^it And we learned that Citadel has shorted THE GODDAMN UNITED STATES ECONOMY in order to buy more shorts ^^I ^^think.  ^^That's ^^the ^^gist ^^of ^^it, ^^right?  

WHAT?! WHY?!  Its' not smart, effective, or reasonable.  

I don't want to make the mistake of underestimating my enemy.

I had to stop thinking like a moral, ethical, or hell, even legal person, and re-thought about the business plan.  What do you do if your bet that Gamestop will go bankrupt fails?  

You plan for a bailout.  We all know there's precedent.  But what if the USG doesn't agree to a bailout?  How do you guarantee one?  

You short the USG bonds, so when the call comes to cover the shorts and the USG doesn't foot the bill, you create the next economic disaster.

**TA;DR:** Citadel are terrorists that are holding the US Economy for ransom.

They will continue to hold the ransom, and continue to short GME and XRT and all the rest using the liquidity from shorting the USG Bonds until a bailout is agreed to.  


**Disclaimers:**

I'm a fucking idiot.

This thesis is predicated upon my understanding of Citadel shorting USG bonds.  If I understand that correctly, this is the ONLY plan that makes sense.
