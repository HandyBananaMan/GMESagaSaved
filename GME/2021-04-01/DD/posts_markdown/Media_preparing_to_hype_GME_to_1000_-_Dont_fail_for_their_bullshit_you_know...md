My own mother (who has been telling me to sell every single week) sent me this today. It details a case for why GME can reach 1,000 and gives advice 

"to those with diamond hands is to take a little off the table. Donâ€™t leave empty-handed."

Now I know as soon it hovers around 1,000 my mother is going to scream at me SELL SELL SELL NOW!! and so is every other media outlet. Like my mother says, I'm an airhead and to stubborn to quit. So when everyone and their mom is telling me to paperhand, I'll tell them "Sorry ape no understand. I only know how to BUY AND HODL"

I only joined GME on the downtrend early Feb so I don't know what the real goal was back then. But it appears media did a similar hype right before/during the rocket launch to try and elicit paperhanding. They will most certainly do it again so be on your guard.

Also, I don't know the bias of Investor Place website, but it seems like they've been on the offensive just as every other media site. As you can see from the past few articles they have been hounding GME as a fools stock and to stay for away from it blah blah blah. Look out for other articles suddenly shifting view which might be a good indication of the coming squeeze.

TLDR; Ignore media and mom. Ape buy and hodl. Diamond hands 20M.
