# EDIT: 1,033,500 shares as of market close April1

# TL:DR

So yesterday, March31, the weird deep ITM call options started happening again. I jumped down the rabbit hole and found what I believe are 44million obfuscated shorts, and you can read more about that here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the\_si\_is\_fake\_i\_found\_44000000\_million\_shorts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the_si_is_fake_i_found_44000000_million_shorts/)

There you will find yesterday's data, historical data, and the SEC publication that explains what mechanism is likely taking place here.

# Why is this huge?

After publishing yesterday's findings, my biggest worry was nothing happening today. Then, my theory would have been built on a blip. However, we saw second consecutive trading day with this activity, and the activity doubled.

So I believe this lends support to these two hypotheses:

1. This activity for one reason or another IS cyclical
2. The cycles ARE getting tighter and more brutal

# April 1st Deep ITM Call 'Anomalies'

Today April 1st, at 1:58:05pm, 1:22:50 pm, 1:22:52pm, and 3:29:24pm another round of deep ITM call 'anomalies' took place. This is a repeat and increase of what we saw at 1:58pm yesterday, when $52m+ was "spent" in these anomalies. 303,900 shares or so were conjured in this way. Today, that value was much higher.

# Altogether: 

# We are in the second day of the deep call activity cycle

# April 1 - 10335 contracts - 1,033,500 shares laundered, FTDs reset, whatever you wanna call it. 

# 3x as much as yesterday! Good on ya Ken!

# Here's the proof for all these individual trades from April1:

Hallmarks:

* Huge block size compared to Open Interest
* Same strikes and expiries as they used before
* 4 trades buying all those strikes and expiries at 1:58:05pm, 1:22:50 pm, 1:22:52pm, and 3:29:24pm
* Of course, the PHLX exchange!
