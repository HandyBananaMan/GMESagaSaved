**Edit 34 4:00PM:**

Ding ding ding! And the bell has rung. Overall a great day for us! (Yes we did end above Max Pain).

Closing around 190.40 ish. Webull updates the closing price a little delayed. I'm expecting good things to come in the coming weeks. Have a great weekend everyone!

**Edit 33 3:43PM:**

I appreciate the kind words everyone :D

Pure speculation, but I believe that they were using Call options to prolong this larger bull trap before they unloaded and tanked the price. By using Calls to maintain a positive delta pressure, selling to close those Calls could induce a net positive delta position on the Market Maker. Now that they have such a large net positive delta, MMs needed to unload shares.

**Edit 32 3:37PM:**

And it seems just about now, those 6 million dollars worth of 250 strike Puts have taken effect.

**Edit 31 3:25PM:**

Seems someone with a 2013 old account with no post history suddenly makes 1 post attacking me. A lot of 1 day/1 week old accounts in the comments doing the same repeating the same things.

All I'm going to say is I bought 100 shares of GME today at the dip I called out. As I said, I put everything into OptionSonar and GME.

I try to teach and deliver my financial knowledge to you for no added incentive. In my past streams, I've gone over strategy, options, company financials, understanding institutional ownership and other topics. I don't just do TA and as I have said on stream, I don't do the typical TA that would not make sense for a manipulated stock. I try to understand options to account for stock manipulation and I'll continue to try my best to educate you all on what I think is happening with the price.

No I won't post my links here again and I've never actively asked for people here to pay attention to them in the first place. I only setup a page on that site because I started streaming. I appreciate the kind people on this sub and just want to make that known.

I will continue to post here freely as I have always done.

**Edit 30 3:05PM:**

There is however an imbalance of Dollar volume for Puts than Calls so I'm investigating why those 250 Puts aren't having as much of a downward effect on the stock price. Possibly those 65 strike far ITM Calls we saw earlier today created a delta positive imbalance on MMs.

**Edit 29 3:02PM:**

Delta hedging from options is more immediate during unprecedented moves like the bull trap push we saw. The new Puts are far ITM Puts (Puts with strikes above market price are far ITM).

If the MMs have a delta positive position, they can write those Puts without selling. If we don't see major downwards pressure, we can assume the MMs are currently near delta neutral.

**Edit 28 2:51PM:**

Shorts are having none of it. They've flooded in their Puts finally.

**Edit 27 2:38PM:**

Nothing bad for us. Just a couple traders who might have wanted to go long, but got hit by their stop losses during the fall.

**Edit 26 2:25PM:**

**Edit 25 2:21PM:**

A load of calls getting put in. Seems the action isn't quite over yet. Possible upside incoming.

**Edit 24 2:12PM:**

A moment of silence for those who got caught in this bull trap.

**Edit 23 2:03PM:**

190 Calls keeping us up for now.

**Edit 22 1:57PM:**

Ok so I think they could be using those to reset more FTDs and setup for more shorting. Possible second fire sale.

**Edit 21 1:49PM:**

I don't believe I've ever seen them do Deep ITM Calls twice in a row before.

**Edit 20 1:48PM:**

Another anomaly. I will investigate.

**Edit 19 1:31PM:**

If we see a fight for 200, GME will have a better chance of spring boarding past the Put wall.

**Edit 18 1:30PM:**

Imo the 200 resistance is too hard to break. They need to break that to take advantage of the high call inventory there.

**Edit 17 1:28PM:**

Lol that's unless they want to push this above 250. Volume ramping up. Perhaps attack by the long whales to break the trap?

**Edit 16 1:26PM:**

Bull trap.

**Edit 15 1:06PM:**

IV crush hitting hard. We're almost back to pre 2/24 IV. IV crush is when implied volatility settles down. This allows for long whales to buy options at a cheaper price.

**Edit 14 12:47PM:**

Puts trickling in slowly. More downwards pressure likely.

https://preview.redd.it/486ycc0wclq61.png?width=2139&format=png&auto=webp&s=4601aa20e9891f2d4987a812fba678f0a00f90ca

**Edit 13 12:29PM:**

No major updates on options. Ticker following the rough trajectory I drew in edit 6. Floating a bit higher than expected. Puts haven't flooded in yet. Perhaps an end of day firesale?

**Edit 12 12:26PM:**

System.out.println("I'm back");

**Edit 11 11:40AM:**

No major changes in option sonar. GME still moving as expected.

The only person that I know has data on those 65 strike Calls (edit: is gone). Don't want this to have any negative connotations.

**Edit 10 10:55AM:**

Puts slowly increasing. These shorts are too easy to read.

**Edit 9 10:43AM:**

Does anyone have optionsonar data for 3/19? This will be very helpful in my investigation!

**Edit 8 10:38AM:**

Anomaly detected. These were 65 strike Calls bought. I'm investigating.

**Edit 7 10:21AM:**

Very very soon, we should see an increase in the amount of Melvin's Puts. This will drag the price back down for Fire Sale #2 towards the end of the day.

**Edit 6 10:19AM:**

Sale number 2 typically comes later in the day.

**Edit 5 10:11AM:**

Melvin's Puts rolling in.

**Edit 4 10:09AM:**

Call options rolling in pushing the price up.

**Edit 3 9:39AM:**

Typically we see a bounce around 9:50AM during a Melvin firesale. So get ready to grab some shares! Could bounce either on the 187.5 or the 184.5 supports.

https://preview.redd.it/xn3dfsfafkq61.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=b514ba83bc708f8e6884284e73ad2495f80e1921

**Edit 2 9:32AM:**

Eerily low volume. 200k on the first minute candle on Webull. Very similar to 3/18 during the last attack by Melvin.

**Edit 1 9:30AM:**

I'll make an update as soon as anything pops up on my option sonar.

Back in early March, Melvin and friends were panicking like crazy. Every other day, they would buy these Deep ITM calls, and the next day, they would short attack with loads of ITM Puts. Seems they are back at it again! It's been 2 weeks since we've seen them do this.

https://preview.redd.it/rogk0r74zlq61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=1db795484366029cac34125abb32e8e5feadc52a

Should start with an opening bounce. We'll perhaps see Melvin come in later in the day.

We did see a strange huge sell candle on the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday. I will be keeping watch closely. It is certainly mysterious.
