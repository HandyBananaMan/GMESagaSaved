<p>This is truly laughable... the manipulation, the volume, wait, what volume? The suppression of the price... day, after day, after day...</p>
<p>Yet, here we are. (Hi Kenny)</p>
<p>Even with a complicit media and government on their side, here we are... still.</p>
<p>I am just wondering what it is that is going to be the proverbial "straw that breaks the camel's back"?</p>
<p>What they don't seem to get is that they need to be right every single day, otherwise it all crashes in on them. We just need to hang around and be right just one time. I like the odds.</p>
