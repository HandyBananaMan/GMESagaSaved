I'm uncovering stuff that's making me shaky. This is distracting me so much from my actual work it's insane. These links are HINTS to what I'm currently energized by.

You don't need to believe me or trust me at the moment. But I ask you all to keep an open mind. For the time being, save this post. I plan to submit DD this weekend!

Hypothesis: MOASS imminent. The government is scrambling because of FinCEN leak. Maybe purposeful leak, honeypot in place, spring the trap sort of thing. Bad actors know they have a tail and are hiding money at a record pace. I'm also trying to find the report about the CTA Side A/B/C being swapped out because I think that's part of it. If someone has that link please provide it.

Truth has always been stranger than fiction. The Simulation has been leaking all year. This is Apeshit!

edit1: hypothesis added, dates added, buzz link updated

edit2: Ryan Cohen tweets about SARs (my running theory driving this upcoming DD) sorry for leaving out the "line" to connect the GME dots with Archegos, FinCEN Files...

edit3: GameStop 10-Q link which connects the SEC investigation with Archegos and DOJ (my running theory...)

edit4: Sears tweet date corrected (5/28/21 to 6/3/21)

edit5: **Update. Not looking good. Will be messaging mods on both subreddits for how to proceed.**
