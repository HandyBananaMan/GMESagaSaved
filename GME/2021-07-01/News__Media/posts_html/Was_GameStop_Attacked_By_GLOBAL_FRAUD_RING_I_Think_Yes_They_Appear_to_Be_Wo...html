<p>I'm uncovering stuff that's making me shaky. This is distracting me so much from my actual work it's insane. These links are HINTS to what I'm currently energized by.</p>
<p>You don't need to believe me or trust me at the moment. But I ask you all to keep an open mind. For the time being, save this post. I plan to submit DD this weekend!</p>

<p>Hypothesis: MOASS imminent. The government is scrambling because of FinCEN leak. Maybe purposeful leak, honeypot in place, spring the trap sort of thing. Bad actors know they have a tail and are hiding money at a record pace. I'm also trying to find the report about the CTA Side A/B/C being swapped out because I think that's part of it. If someone has that link please provide it.</p>

<p>Truth has always been stranger than fiction. The Simulation has been leaking all year. This is Apeshit!</p>

<p>edit1: hypothesis added, dates added, buzz link updated</p>
<p>edit2: Ryan Cohen tweets about SARs (my running theory driving this upcoming DD) sorry for leaving out the "line" to connect the GME dots with Archegos, FinCEN Files...</p>
<p>edit3: GameStop 10-Q link which connects the SEC investigation with Archegos and DOJ (my running theory...)</p>
<p>edit4: Sears tweet date corrected (5/28/21 to 6/3/21)</p>
<p>edit5: <strong>Update. Not looking good. Will be messaging mods on both subreddits for how to proceed.</strong></p>
