<p>I've gotten about 30 texts in the past 30 minutes from my boss, trying to hype up my division since it's the last day of the month and he wants to make that money. </p>
<p>This motherfucker has gone complete radio silence at times this month, and now he's mashing his fingers against his phone so hard he's likely to dislocate a knuckle. </p>
<p>Can we MOASS so I can retire and never have to deal with this shit again? Pretty please?</p>
