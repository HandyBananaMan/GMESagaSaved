<h1>Title: The original FUD has slipped back into our subs, almost unnoticed, and is developing into the MOAFUD. This is why they wanted stonksub, to gently reset this number in our discussion and exit plans. This is why unending puddle was banned.</h1>

<p>**I've noticed a pretty serious downward creep in the assumed approximate true SI%. For a while I was hearing 900%, then 550%, and now for the last month or so, 200%. Whether it's being posted by shills or not, this is FUD, yall. It matters a lot because if we know a minimum of volume to look for during MOASS, we have the best anti-paperhand tool possible: the \*for sure knowledge\* that apes are holding and the squeeze ain't squoze.**</p>
<p>This was auto removed from ss, I believe it was removed here the first time because i added an edit and mentioned popcorn. I have removed that edit, and reposted because I feel this is FUD developing now with the 100M shares being hidden in puts in Brazil. I think they're going to 'show' us - let us find it ourselves - roughly 200% of the float in hidden shorts, to 'confirm' that true SI is somewhere around 200%. This can be hugely influential in shaking misinformed paperhands watching the volume as they plan to exit.</p>
<p>Flaired as DD because my post is based on an excellent early DD I feel is very important for new and old apes.</p>

<p>In February, this DD was posted in GME and received critical acclaim - credit to u/moonski :</p>

<p>And the general consensus was that the true short interest was likely at or around 900%, or would soon get there and continue. This is the central question of the MOASS thesis - you may know it as, 'how much more than the float does retail own?', or 'how much do we need to hold forever to cause an unending puddle?'</p>
<p>OP also mentions - in a post 5 months ago - that FINRA slipped up and mentioned 226% SI on January 15th, which we somewhat recently found in the discovery documents of the RH class action suit, the exact SI% and date. OP was right about that, and he was right that SI was probably around 967%. FIVE MONTHS AGO.</p>
<p>This SI% downward creep in our subs is absolutely the work of shills, guys, and it's the original MOAFUD. *It's what they bought the media for!!* Don't forget the ads they took out, don't forget the anchors they have on payroll, don't forget CNBC lying to your face for months. Don't let them get your paperhands when you see the volume hit 3-5 times the float, thinking you're gonna end up bagholding. EASILY enough of us are holding for the infinitay pul. We will see a 100% buy ratio with 1 billion volume before MOASS is over.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As for my own contribution, a quick calculation to update this loose approximation:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>58x the float has been traded since the sneeze (source: charlie’s vids)</p>
<p>Daily short volume has been between 60%-70% \*every day\* since then - we’ll go with a conservative estimate, 60%. My source for this is the daily short volume guy, I’m sure you’ve seen his posts. There have been a couple of days it dropped to 58-59%, but many more days it hit 73-75%. If somebody could link his posts or tag him I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>58x75M = 4.35 billion shares traded</p>
<p>60% short volume means at least 20% contributed to the accumulating short position, assuming the other 40% of volume was them covering - this is an \*extremely conservative assumption\* because we know institutions aren't selling, state pensions aren't selling, and diamond handed apes are not selling. Probably the only people selling this stock at all are retail day traders that are also half in on popcorn and can't be convinced that's their play, not ours.</p>
<p>So, minimum 20% of all the volume since January added to the short position.</p>
<p>4.35B(0.2) = 870M new naked shorts (I say naked because of course they've been naked shorting that much, they naked short GME and every stock 100% of the time. Look at some more 5 month old DDs if you don't believe me)</p>
<p>870M/75M = 11.6x the float shorted since the sneeze. Add to short interest from RH class action discovery (226% on jan 15)</p>
<p>= 1386% SI minimum, with the most pessimistic assumptions I had room to make.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL:DR'; **This is why they wanted to take over a sub and haven't given up - they want to normalize 200% as the true short interest so apes will paperhand after they see 140 million volume with 100% buy volume from shorts closing, afraid to be bagholders. Listen to me apes - we will see 1 billion volume when the DTC computers go brrrrrr and fill every single blank check on the planet. If each of us holds at least 10% of our shares, the eternal puddle is guaranteed.**</p>
<p>**What do you do when your enemy has all the leverage and you have none? You convince them not to believe its true by any means possible as a matter of survival.**</p>
<p>200% SI is a joke. 200% SI is a fucking fantasy for Ken Griffin.</p>
<p>We know what it's worth to you, Kenny, but you don't know what it's worth to us yet. Every single share is worth you and all your friends in two chains on Youtube. Perp walk for me, slut.</p>
<p>Diamond. Fucking. Hands.</p>
