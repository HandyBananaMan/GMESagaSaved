<p>The last time we saw close to this number available was 5th March with 1,000,000 available. <br />
The amount of borrowable shares has been increasing drastically since 5th August (only 45,000 available EOD). Could this be one reason we didn't see much shorting today? Are they holding out so they can cause another sharp tabling in the price rather than simple price suppressio?. <br />
