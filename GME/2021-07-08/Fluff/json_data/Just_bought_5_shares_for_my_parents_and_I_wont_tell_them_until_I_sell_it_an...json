    "selftext": "Sorry I had to share this with someone and nobody better than my fellow apes. My parents are in financial distress due to covid and personal health problems. Their small business is going under due to their business partner screwing them over. \n\nMy parents have always given my brothers and I everything they could and sacrificed a lot for us. I started buying and selling products on Facebook to make some extra money and I\u2019ve finally made enough to buy them 5 shares. \n\nI know I\u2019m not the only one that\u2019s bought some shares for their parents or loved ones and that\u2019s so amazing to know. I can\u2019t wait to change their lives and give them everything they deserve. \n\nI really can\u2019t wait to party with you apes and change the world for the better \u270a\ud83c\udffe\n\nEdit: You guys are far too kind with the awards and kind words. I appreciate each and everyone of you apes \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udffe",
