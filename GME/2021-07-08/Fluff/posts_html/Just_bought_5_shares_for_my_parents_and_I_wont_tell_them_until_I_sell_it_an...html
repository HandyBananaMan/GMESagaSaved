<p>Sorry I had to share this with someone and nobody better than my fellow apes. My parents are in financial distress due to covid and personal health problems. Their small business is going under due to their business partner screwing them over. </p>
<p>My parents have always given my brothers and I everything they could and sacrificed a lot for us. I started buying and selling products on Facebook to make some extra money and I’ve finally made enough to buy them 5 shares. </p>
<p>I know I’m not the only one that’s bought some shares for their parents or loved ones and that’s so amazing to know. I can’t wait to change their lives and give them everything they deserve. </p>
<p>I really can’t wait to party with you apes and change the world for the better ✊🏾</p>
<p>Edit: You guys are far too kind with the awards and kind words. I appreciate each and everyone of you apes 🙏🏾✊🏾</p>
