We are not alone.

I am not alone.

I hodl till we can all change our lives and i can move out of my little brothers room.  

All i ask is that you guys do the same.

When they shutdown our communication..... hodl
When the fud tells us we are wrong..... hodl
When youtubers use mass emotions.... hodl

We grew up with gamestop now lets help fuel their second chance at life.

Not financial advice (obviously i lost everything and live with my parents in my little brothera room)
