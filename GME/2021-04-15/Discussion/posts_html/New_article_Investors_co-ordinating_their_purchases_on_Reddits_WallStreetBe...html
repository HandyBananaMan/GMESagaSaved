<p>Kenny G started pushing this narrative weeks ago, and now it's ramping up. I've seen several articles in the last 24 hours about how reddit is "coordinating" or "working together." We're not working together. Let's be honest. I don't care about your personal finances; I just want to get paid. I'm betting that the shorts haven't covered, and that's it. This media nonsense goes beyond libel against the people posting here.</p>
<p>When the stock goes up and hedge funds lose, it's labeled "GameStop losses."</p>
<p>When the stock goes down and paper hands lose, it's labeled "GameStop losses."</p>
<p>When the board who failed the company got the boot, it's "Board walks out over stock volatility."</p>
<p>When they pay off $240,000,000 debt from cash on hand, it's "GameStop tries to break longest losing streak in 3.5 years."</p>
<p>When GameStop updated their filing that allows them to sell shares, it's "GameStop announces they will sell 3.5 million shares to raise money."</p>
<p>Is there a point that these people face would legal consequences for conspiracy to manipulate the market? Anyone who actually looks at it will see they're bad faith actors. It's beyond the point where I'd call it coincidence, and call it actively working in concert. I'm thinking about dedicating a hard drive to DD and stock movements by date, and coordinating that with saved copies of all of these articles that are written in bad faith. Is there any point in something like that? This is all shady as fuck, and they're going to try to continue to make the whole world hate reddit. What concerns me more is people with enormous wealth may go after some of the more popular names here. You know, with <strong><em>more</em></strong> "suicidal thoughts," trying to force people into courts, or <em>whatever</em>. There is obviously something wrong, but it ain't me and my 420 @ 69.</p>
<p>I bought in because I liked the stock. I hold because I like it even more now. Their actions are so obviously coordinated, I don't even need to look at the numbers. I believe that nobody would work this hard to get me to sell unless they desperately needed me to sell. I don't know what your reasons are for holding or selling, and I don't care. You do what you want. I'll keep holding. Also, because IANAL, can an outsider like a journalist get a reward from the SEC if they reveal that they've been instructed to use a specific slant on GME? Some articles I'm reading claim that publishing articles with an intent to change the stock price counts as market manipulation. Can a more experienced ape direct me toward a credible resource that explains this?</p>
<p>None of this is financial advice. Only an idiot would misconstrue it as such. Now I'll go rewatch that video of the guy eating a crayon.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - If there's proof of a journalist or group of journalists writing with intent to lower the price, does that fall under market manipulation? Is a journalist eligible for an SEC reward if they show that they were told to write in a way that negatively impacts GME?</p>
