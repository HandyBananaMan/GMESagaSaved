When this hits $10m a share Blackrock going to have $92 trillion. Let me type that out for your less wrinkled brain apes that do not understand numbers: ninety two trillion, one hundred seventy three billion three hundred fifty million (apologies for those that also can't read).

Crazy money at stake here, but got to keep them diamond hands strong and hodl the line fellow APES! The squeezles is primed to be squoozened **ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**
