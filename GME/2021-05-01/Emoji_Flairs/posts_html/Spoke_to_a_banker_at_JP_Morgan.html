<p>I’m a cashier and today a customer came in to buy some random shit and after some small talk he told me he worked at JP Morgan. I jokingly asked him “Is Gamestop giving you any problems?” And he hesitated and told me it DID, and then proceeded to tell me that’s it’s a bad investment. When I told him I had 10 shares he kept talking about how ‘it’s brick and mortar and that there’s no way that company is going anywhere etc.’ I could tell he wasn’t happy talking about GME. I wanted to tell him how the company paid off all its debt and has 500M to reshape the company towards an online e-commerce focus, but I didn’t want to upset a customer lmao. Basically this guy wanted me to sell and still thinks the company’s going to fail. I just wanted to get this out on my lunch break 🚀🚀🚀</p>
