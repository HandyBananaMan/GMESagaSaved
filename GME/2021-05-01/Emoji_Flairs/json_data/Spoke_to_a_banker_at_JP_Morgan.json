    "selftext": "I\u2019m a cashier and today a customer came in to buy some random shit and after some small talk he told me he worked at JP Morgan. I jokingly asked him \u201cIs Gamestop giving you any problems?\u201d And he hesitated and told me it DID, and then proceeded to tell me that\u2019s it\u2019s a bad investment. When I told him I had 10 shares he kept talking about how \u2018it\u2019s brick and mortar and that there\u2019s no way that company is going anywhere etc.\u2019 I could tell he wasn\u2019t happy talking about GME. I wanted to tell him how the company paid off all its debt and has 500M to reshape the company towards an online e-commerce focus, but I didn\u2019t want to upset a customer lmao. Basically this guy wanted me to sell and still thinks the company\u2019s going to fail. I just wanted to get this out on my lunch break \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
