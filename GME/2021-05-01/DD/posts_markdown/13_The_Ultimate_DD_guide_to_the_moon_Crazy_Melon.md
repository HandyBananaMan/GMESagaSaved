**US DOLLAR BACKING**

The US dollar backing system has changed from gold to oil and finally to [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).

Basically means the Federal Reserve can print **‚Äúan almost unlimited amount of dollars‚Äù** and they've been doing exactly that! 1/5th of the total dollars **ever minted** in the history of the US **have been printed in the last year and a half.** All that liquidity has been used by Kenny as part of his strategy.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**OVERVIEW OF KENNY'S/SHITADEL'S FUCKERY EXPOSED!**

More details and explanation of everything will be found as you keep reading!!

**First we start with their relationship with retail brokerages (Us Ape GME owners), then we move on to even shadier things:**

**Retail brokerages send money/order flow to Citadel MM (Market Maker)**

**Shitadel take the money, buys the shares mainly through home mortgage and auto loan-funded/related ETFs (so it doesn‚Äôt reflect positively on the price) then sell them through the main exchanges (the price is affected by a sell and tanks)**

**Kenny doesn‚Äôt deliver the share to the broker/retail (the retail receives an IOU) and instead he borrows the share and sells it again on the main exchange to short (tanking the price again).**

**Kenny will use the same share and recycle it (borrowing and selling) many times creating multiple IOUs to brokers/retail (with one share sometimes producing 9-10 IOUs) My wild dreams say is 2000% the SI. That‚Äôs just my crazy me, time will tell.**

**At the same time while shorting they will (Shitadel)** [creates their own trust bonds](https://www.wiredupreport.com/2021/03/16/viral/citadel-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/) **and ties those fake shares to those trust bonds as collateral, sells them (whoever buys this bonds hold the garbage), and gets a shit ton of money (remember, fake shares money).**

**THIS IS HIS INFINITE MONEY GLITCH AND SHITADEL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR EVERYTHING!!**

I will explain more about this later on!!

Now Shitadel has a stupid amount of money, and what he needs to do? **HE NEEDS TO WASH IT TO MAKE IT LEGITIMATE!!!**

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

**HOW IS KENNY WASHING THE MONEY?**

**With that money he is most likely doing shady things, in order to wash it and make it ‚ÄúLEGIT‚Äù:**

He might be using more methods but this are the ones **I caught him off guard so far**, I think we all have seen his fuckery!!

**METHOD #1: buy real shares (a bit for themselves and also transactions from the brokers and MM, order flow).**

They buy real shares to keep creating naked shares from them and recycling them to keep the machine running over and over.

They make transactions with other brokers and charge fees for that, making money for the books. Also the good old payment for order flow PFOF system RH loves.

Making money and also using it to wash the empty fake trust bonds (sometimes partially empty), that‚Äôs where the money is for him!!

They're not just shorting GME, they short tons of other companies as well. Those shorts need to seem legitimate and have real money backing them up (trust bond money) so no margin call happens if the SEC comes looking. Real money backing it so it‚Äôs ‚ÄúALL LEGAL AND LEGITIMATE‚Äù

You know the drill! **Boom Money Washed!**

**METHOD #2: Betting in the company knowing the result (manipulate the performance and outcome).**

Bet on the companies performance (not only short betting, but also making calls and manipulating it up and down)

It‚Äôs easy to bet if you can manipulate the outcome right?

Nice casino Kenny! **Boom Money Washed!**

**METHOD #3: Move the money overseas by funding overseas companies**

Fund companies overseas (together with other bank friends) and receive assets or Treasury bonds strips (T-bonds) as collateral (countries overseas have T-bonds to use as collateral for money) with interest rates of about 12%+!! **Boom Money Washed!**

He‚Äôs making money on both sides of the trade, when giving the money he is making huge $$ in conversion exchange rates and fees, as well as when receiving the Collateral $$ for fees and exchange rates when it applies. **Boom!** ***this money is legitimate now!***

[https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/)

**METHOD 4: Scoop all the real estate from bankrupted companies**

[Scoop up all the real estate and assets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amydobson/2019/09/19/billionaire-ken-griffin-adds-99-million-purchase-to-massive-real-estate-portfolio/amp/) that are left behind when the companies are bankrupt, buying the retail dirt cheap. **That‚Äôs why Kenny targets brick and mortar, imagine GME stores closing and Kenny buying those properties for pennies.**

**With real estate the scam is even bigger! I‚Äôll explain more after!**

**Boom Money Washed!**

**METHOD 5: Buy real estate and assets (art, gold and other tangibles)**

With the real money made by selling his trust bonds, buy expensive houses

[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-most-expensive-home-ever-sold-us-nyc-penthouse-2019-1%3famp](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-most-expensive-home-ever-sold-us-nyc-penthouse-2019-1%3famp)

Expensive art

[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/02/18/ken-griffin-spent-500-million-on-two-paintings-sources.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2016/02/18/ken-griffin-spent-500-million-on-two-paintings-sources.html)

And any other valuable asset you could imagine to try to wash his money and make it legitimate!

**With real estate the scam is huge, check this link up!**

[https://news.utexas.edu/2020/12/03/lending-fraud-could-wreck-economy-again/](https://news.utexas.edu/2020/12/03/lending-fraud-could-wreck-economy-again/)

Means he can get **loans and allocate his TRUST BONDS (derivates) as collateral instead of buying the real estate with money!** So the banks are getting SHIT TRUST BONDS in exchange of houses and real estate!!

Omfg!!!! ANOTHER HOUSING MARKET BUBBLE!!!! **Boom Money Washed!**

I‚Äôll explain a bit more about those TRUST BONDS SOON! Very important

**METHOD 6: He's buying the competition!!**

[They use part of that money to buy other Market Makers](https://www.thetradenews.com/citadel-securities-expands-trading-floor-unit-at-nyse-with-imc-takeover/)!!! So they buy the actual stock floor!

Buy out the competition!

Right after they bought IMC, [they sued The SEC for approving a new ‚ÄúD-limit‚Äù order type for IEX](https://i.imgur.com/h2QMqV3.png).

**Boom Money Washed!**

**METHOD 7: Buy Treasury (bills, notes and bonds) mostly those juicy 10 years notes!**

The buy Treasuries (especially 10 years notes) to wash the money and have leverage, leverage for what? They are shorting the treasury too! So counter leverage... **YIKES!**

**Boom Money Washed!**

**METHOD 8: Short the Treasury!!**

[Using part of that money to short the government bonds](https://www.localsuccess.org/shorting-the-us-treasury-bond-2021/) (especially 10 Year Treasury bonds) knowing about a highly probably hyperinflation caused by the federal reserve printing too much money, the stimulus and other factors.

They counter the leverage by having T-bonds and T-notes of the ones they bought and also the collateral when lending money to other countries.

Refer to "The Everything Short‚Äù by u/atobitt.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the\_everything\_short/?utm\_source=share\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app\&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Additionally, he's shorting treasury T-bonds and T-notes because he expects a lack of solvency on the part of the Federal Reserve.

**Boom Money Washed!**

Read this bit about bonds (taken from the linkl bellow):

**However, government-backed bonds**, particularly those in emerging markets, can carry risks that include country risk, political risk, and central-bank risk, including whether the banking system is solvent. Investors saw a bleak reminder of how risky some government bonds can be during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998. During this crisis, several Asian nations were forced to devalue their currency which sent reverberations around the globe. The crisis even caused Russia to default on its debt.

About all this... Michael Burry has been warning us about a possible hyperinflation, all this will be **explained LATER ON!!**

I'm going to break down each one of Kenny strategies as we go in the post.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TRUST BONDS: The basket of bonds INFITINE MONEY GLITCH!!!**

First of all let me stress how important this is!

**THIS IS KENNY MAIN SOURCE OF CASH (LIQUIDITY)**, with this he's able to do all kinds of fuckery from shorting, to all the washing methods above (Ill explain more with sources as we move forward).

They love shorting because they love producing naked shares to fill up the juicy [**TRUST BONDS**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateraltrustbond.asp#:~:text=A%20collateral%20trust%20bond%20is,pay%20the%20bondholder%2C%20if%20necessary) and get more and more cash for liquidity and fukery!!

So what's inside those **TRUST BONDS?**

"A collateral trust bond is a bond that is secured by a financial asset such as stock or other bonds"

WAIT WHAT???

So you telling me that Kenny is not only able to put his NAKED SHARES inside this basket called **TRUST BONDS** and pack it to sell, but that he can **PUT TRUST BONDS INSIDE OTHER TRUST BONDS?**

This is the pyramid and biggest **PONZI SCHEME!!!!**

Hear me out:

They have been **shorting many businesses** and also **buying some long positions in many other** businesses (I read somewhere and I cant find the source that Citadel controls 26% (according to the senate in the hearing) of the market). Thank you for the comment u/citadelsecuritiesLLC

So this means that they can **grab a basket** (TRUST BOND) and **filling it up with half "good solid long positions"**(lets say aple, tesla, amazon) and **half GME naked made up shares!!, close the basket and sell it!. Thats a 50% Good old TRUST BOND from citadel.**

**HOLY ACTUAL FU%\^CK!! Are you serious??**

Gets worse!!

So you telling me that you can **fill bonds with other bonds?** That's tranching and creating the pyramid of shit underneath!

**THIS IS THE BIG SHORT ALL OVER AGAIN!!**

The first baskets full with the Good nice long positions and real shorts go first! like the AAA in the movie?

The **last baskets are going be filled with not only GME naked shorts**, but with a **MIX OF ALL THE OTHER COMPANIES THEY ARE SHORTING INCLUDING TESLA, AMAZON** and you name **to give them a better rating and price, BUT THEY ARE COMPLETELY FULL OF NOTHING INSIDE!!** those ones are the equivalent of the BBB LIKE IN THE BIG SHORT!!!

Come on! is this **HAPPENING AGAIN**, are you serious?????

**WHEN IS THIS PEOPLE GOING TO LEARN???**

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

**Now... The biggest banks are holdings! (READ BELLOW ABOUT IT)**

**Kenny and kids (Melvin, Susquehanna and other baby hedge funds) have been shorting over and over to own companies debt to hold leverage against the banks for daddy Kenny as well!**

So... **While the company is not yet bankrupt ‚Ä¶.** [Shitadel MM makes trust bonds](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-12-08-0612080128-story.html)**, pack them with all the fake GME naked shares inside (can be mixed with other company shorts or full GME) and** [sell them as if they were full of valuable real GME](https://www.wiredupreport.com/2021/03/16/viral/citadel-issued-600m-worth-of-bbb-rated-bonds/) **(the system don‚Äôt recognize fakes from reals, right?)** Getting tons of money!

**That's a big part of how he gets his Liquidity!!**

His process is extremely complex, he uses algorithms to move the money constantly and very fast, trenching those bonds inside others and reposition them to hide all the rubbish undetected, also buying T-bonds, mortgages, short more companies and etc.

\--------------------------------

Also, like the [SEC document](https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-087103/) states, Kenny and other banks are funding other business in many other countries giving them money and taking advantage (we know how).

When those business bankrupt too! Archegos style!!, they go and buy the real estate overseas dirt cheap!) They love making naked shares because that‚Äôs how they get liquidity out of those useless juicy trust bonds.

Explained better in the KENNY SCAMMING AROUND THE WORLD in PART 2

**So the money come from none existent trash and then make a shit ton more moving it?** Holy Balls!

**The ones who buy those Shitadel trust bonds are the bagholders!! They are buying bonds that are full of shit!!**

He is successfully draining the money from the company, from the retail shareholder and for all the people that bought those trust bonds!! While making a shit ton of money from NON EXISTING SHARES PACKED IN BIG BAGS OF SHIT!

\---------------------------------------

**BIG BANKS ARE ‚ÄúHOLDINGS‚Äù???? WHAT IS THAT?**

First we need to learn [what is a holding company?](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/using-a-holding-company-operating-company-structure-to-help-mitigate-risk) [Restaurant Brands International (RBI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Brands_International) is an example of a holding company for a group of popular Quick Service (Fast Food) restaurants. They own Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeyes. In this case RBI holding is basically a basket of a few fast food restaurants put together, like a stock ETF. It is the basket of those businesses and the value is according to those companies performance.

So are banks holding companies? Well...

**As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to the Federal Reserve's credit facilities. (**[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holding_company))

These holdings are filled up by pieces of many private institutions they lent money to: businesses, hedge funds, as well as people they lent money to (mortgages, auto loans, student loans, etc., plus money they lent to the government. Obviously as well as the money the people deposit and keep in their bank account (it will be their liquidity if they don't use your money, most of the time they move your money.)

**Keep in mind: The federal reserve is privately owned (not part of the government and instead is sanctioned and backed by it) by the 12 reserve banks and the 0.01% (THE BIG BIG WHALES) (they are the top contributors to the reserve).** [Federal Reserve Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System) WHAAAAAT?

But lets keep going with the banks...

Think about every company borrowing money from a bank and putting their assets as collateral (putting that stock collateral inside the bank's basket/pool, mainly ETFs).

Now the bank owns part of the company in form of debt collateral. The bigger the company debt the bigger part of the pie the bank owns as collateral, right? Big leverage!

Also, some ETFs are pretty much a basket/pool full of many many company shares that are supposed to be the collateral for the debts. Some others are filled with as packages of people‚Äôs debt (student loans, mortgages, etc). Others full of government debt to the banks.

Put all those shares and pieces of the company (could be turned into liquidity if sold in case of company liquidation or too much risk) and their liquidity backing of cash (people‚Äôs bank accounts deposited) together and that‚Äôs what the bank is made of. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong on the comments please. The banks own leverage on those companies they lend money too.

Take a break!! I know this is very intense, but with every word I can see your hands getting harder and harder after knowing WTF is going on!
