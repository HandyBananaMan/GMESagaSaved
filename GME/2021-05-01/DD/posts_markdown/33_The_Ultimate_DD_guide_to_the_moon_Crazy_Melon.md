KENNY KENNY KENNETH: A little bit of history..

‚ÄúKenny, Kenny‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs all learn a little about Kenny past.  Kenneth Cordele Griffin was born October 15, 1968.  For a majority of his life he attended Boca Raton Community High School.  It was a public school, where he was the head of the finance club‚Ä¶ No, actually he was president of Math Club.  

His investing career actually was initiated at the Cabot House as an undergraduate at Haaaaarvard.  He must have learned to pay  off the right people as he was able to get a satellite dish placed on the roof.  His initial ride was with convertible bonds, with was powered from his late grandma to the tune of 265 K.  Not a bad chunk of change to begin your investing career.  So where did Ken break out &amp;amp;amp;amp; how did he do it?  Well no other way than to short stock and have the stock market crash of ‚Äô87.  

Kenny pushin‚Äô them shorts this whole time.  It‚Äôs too cold to be wearin‚Äô shorts in those Chicago winters.  Da‚Äô Frostbite appears to be setting in.‚Äù

**THE ENDGAME: INEVITABLE! NO FUD**


**Kenny now is trapped**. Now we known his game!!

**We also know he IS SHORTING THE the 0.01%, the government and the economy!!!**

Why is Kenny want to do all this? 

**THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!**

He wants to be THE KING!! To big to be touched!

He always wanted to be a bank and be part of the 0.01%

**Putting my Tin Hat on** this might sound crazy but‚Ä¶. It does align with Kenny goals!

Why to move to texas?

a) Because in texas he can apply for a banking license and become a bank (state banks have lot less regulations than federal banks)

b) scoop up all the cheap commercial real estate 

c) becomes a massive player in the banking environment

**WHY DOES KENNY WANTS TO BE A BANK SO BADLY?**

A state bank is lot less regulated than a federal bank.

**A BANK IS THE ONLY PIECE MISSING IN KENNY PUZZLE**

This way he will eliminate the middle man, the bank does everything for his fuckery.

Having a bank means, he will be the one setting the price of the appraisals, also giving the loans, then also liquidating the asset and auctioning controlling the prices to buy everything at the price he wants.

Being able to always inflate the appraisals and pocket the difference everytime more and more!

And buying the real estate dirt cheap always! Perfect set up!

Ohhhh the banks game!!!

The 0.01% didn‚Äôt let him in because he‚Äôs too greedy and try to absorb everything, also he wasn‚Äôt born into the 0.01%.** he doesn‚Äôt have the surname or the generous gramma.

So then he said fuk it! I‚Äôm going to be the king and bigger than anybody!!

**Ambition much Kenny?**

**Sorry Kenny!**

You can‚Äôt buy your way into the 0.01% club, you need to born with the surname and Griffin isn't cutting it.

**Kenny no likey 0.01 percento nada!**

He‚Äôs been issuing **years after years of those bad bad useless trust bonds** and everyone buys them thinking are solid gold from Shitadel!

And pocketing so much real estate dirt cheap with all this fuckery!

**HOW THE SEC CAN CATCH HIM?**

Follow the transactions!! 

Open those bonds full of naked shares that‚Äôs are imaginary!!

Check on the Treasury (bills, notes and bonds) transactions, how many they have, how many they had and touch Kenny hands.

Also check where the money they used for Treasuries come from!

Why are they OVER SHORTING business?

Open your eyes and realize that they are targeting business that are real estate heavy for a reason!!

There is clear market manipulation CLEAR 

There is clear MEDIA manipulation, hundreds of examples

Go and check the loan contracts and compare the loan values of appraisal given versus the real values of the properties!

Follow the money and follow the real estate.

Follow companies like this IOR (clearly the worse website I‚Äôve seen). Only takes 1 minute to see this website to know this is a scam! And this company is managing a 51M market cap and can‚Äôt even make a half decent website? PLEASE!!!

How dumb they think we are seriously!!

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IOR

http://www.incomeopp-realty.com/management.html

I 5 year old can make a better website than that!!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

**How‚Äôs is the 0.01% is fighting back??**


Creating a **bubble too big to handle** in GME so they can breaks the Citadel (Kenny and friends) and margin call them before the Federal Reserve implodes!!!

**or exposing his scam and making rules and also by forcing him to cover the shorts!!** it‚Äôs all a lie and fake at the end of the day!

They need to come up with firewalls (801/002 and others) and **ways to protect all the banks and members of the DTCC that are not part of the Shitadel** and friends scam!! That‚Äôs why all those rules have been coming in place.

Once everything is ready Shitadel and friends are gonna be forced to cover their shorts and naked shorts everywhere. (The bubble is so big that they are gonna get margin called, my floor is $15 million btw).

Kenny will have to cover institutional shorts, retail shorts, ETFs as well as those garbage trust bonds full of empty shells. **Remember that Kenny need to return those borrowed naked IOUs and put a real share in every empty shell on peoples accounts and bonds!!** But there is more! Don‚Äôt forget the bets!

**Forgot about the FTD plus all the puts accumulated for years that expire 1/16, 4/16 (yes DFV day!!) and 7/17!!?? Thanks for the correction btw!!üòç

That's another massive fukery scam going on and is HUGE! Federal Bank and friends need to break Citadel before Citadel breaks them, the economy and the government by scamming everyone and bankrupting companies!!

**SUMMARY**

**Holy fuc%#ing shit!!!**

**Apes are the last line of defense!!!!! PROTECT THE ECONOMY FROM PREDATOR KENNY G!!!**

Now remember, when was the last time Uncle Sam didn‚Äôt get his money? I can‚Äôt remember.. **Because Uncle Sam always gets his money and he‚Äôs coming for Kenny and our tendies!!**

**All of them!! This is Citadel (Kenny and friends) vs the DTCC, Federal Reserve and the banks and the PLANET OF THE APEEEEEES!!**

Im seriously **JACKED TO THE TITS!!**

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Kenny is in the deep with something around **2000%+ SI no joke**.

Remember Trump calling Ken out in his speech? Kenny is hiding all his money somewhere. Now we know where: art, real estate, and more. Whose money? *The Federal Reserve and retail's money!* So far he's been kicking the cans [with fukery like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzgtvx/a_method_for_hiding_ftds_that_uses_the_109mil/).

**Kenny and Citadel have liquidity to fight for now, but the machine stopped printing. Now it‚Äôs just matter of time, and some MELON just unfolded the entire fuckery!**

As an aside/addendum to all this...but for the sake of not making this long post even longer...

Im making post 2 on GME subs.

Next part will talk about something as important that is change from **LIBOR to SOFR** as well as ***The Big Short's*** **Michael Burry's warnings on hyperinflation**.

This will be a part of the world history, in the end I think the economy will be alright thanks to ape's stimulation, dont be scared ([READ PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n286u2/22_the_ultimate_dd_guide_to_the_moon_crazy_melon/)).

\----------------------------

**TL;DR 1: Kenny is in big trouble for trying to scam the big big money (bigger money than Bezos, Gates and Musk combined) and everyone else to own the banks/Federal Reserve. Machine no printing for him anymore so he‚Äôs been drained and his game uncovered. Apes need to be patient and keep BUYING AND HOLDING!!! The end is near.**

\----------------------------------

**BURRY CONCERN: HYPERINFLATION**

This is quite a handful matter to talk about, I encourage you to do your own research cuz i might be wrong or this might be incomplete.

But im gonna give it a go! FOR YOU MY AMAZING APES!

Dr Michael Burry (we all remember him for predicting the 2008 housing market collapse and the big short (Christian bale - Batman!!))

He has been warning us for a while about a highly probably hyperinflation

Quote from the [article](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/big-short-michael-burry-warren-buffett-inflation-dangers-warning-investors-2021-2?r=US&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;IR=T):

‚ÄúBurry has been sounding the alarm on inflation. He warned investors last week to ‚Äúprepare for inflation‚Äù as the US economy reopens and receives a fresh round of stimulus. He also compared America‚Äôs current trajectory to Germany‚Äôs path to hyperinflation in the 1920s.‚Äù

[https://www.businessinsider.com.au/big-short-michael-burry-warren-buffett-inflation-dangers-warning-investors-2021-2?r=US&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/big-short-michael-burry-warren-buffett-inflation-dangers-warning-investors-2021-2?r=US&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;IR=T)

The effects of inflation causes different ripple effects, usually increases the banks interest rates reducing the amount of demand of loans, among many many other side effects.

Also causes products such as goods or services to rise. That will reduce the buying power of a currency.

\---- **CURRENCY BUYING POWER AND DEPRECIATION**

Imagine you having $5 and being able to buy a train ticket for $3 and an ice cream for $2.

When inflation rises, means that the buying power of your money is gonna be reduced, now the train ticket is $3.50 and the ice cream is $2.30, suddenly with your $5 you can only get the train ticket and you are short $0.80 for the ice cream :((.

\---- **RIPPLE IN THE MORTGAGE LIKE 2008**

The ripples effect also affects other things like loans or mortgages.

If you have a subprime loan or mortgage with adjustable rates (this mortgages where the ones that caused the 2008 housing collapse trough swaps) and the interests rates of the banks go up, suddenly my mortgage payments will go up, a lot of people that doesn‚Äôt have enough money to pay that different will stop paying and the mortgages will default.

This affects on auto loans, student loans and more.

Well‚Ä¶ with hyperinflation‚Ä¶ like the prefix hyper says, it‚Äôs BIGGER! So imagine that scenario bigger.

Possibly worse that 2008!!! And the rates and indexes like the SP500 look high.

Seems scary right? It‚Äôs not!!

Check one of my posts for 2 weeks ago talking about this (I made it when I didn't know as much so dont hit me too hard on that one!! :P)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqmj5e/the\_how\_is\_this\_gonna\_play\_out\_game\_my\_prediction/?utm\_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqmj5e/the_how_is_this_gonna_play_out_game_my_prediction/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Everything is going to be fine and if something this is very healthy for the economy.

The best thing that we need right now is to stop Kenny from creating bubbles of fake shares everywhere!! **Its a parasite inside the market!**

Let‚Äôs keep going, gets better and better! Read my  **TL;DR** further down.

**EDIT 4: WARNING WARNING ON ETFs STREET!!**

"ETFs are linked like a web. We've had two flash crashes amplified by them in the last 11 years, and their behavior during last year's pandemic accelerated the crash. CMBS are potentially a bowling ball that's going to crash through the spider web of ETFs.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**LIBOR to SOFR**

Take all this this a grain of salt, Probably make a couple of mistakes. [READ THE CHAOS THEORY DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos_theory_the_final_connection/) to have the proper DD about this. (recommend the whole saga!!)

Changes from Libor to SOFR were meant to happen in 2022, but guess what?

They pushed to to June 2021!!!

[https://webstorage.paulhastings.com/Documents/PDFs/timeline-for-libor-transition.pdf?sfvrsn=363ea8ab\_2](https://webstorage.paulhastings.com/Documents/PDFs/timeline-for-libor-transition.pdf?sfvrsn=363ea8ab_2)

**This is massive!! Why?**

Banks used LIBOR to manipulate their self created and self reported interest rates in order to be favorable and give away money left right and center. Where did tons of that money go? To HEDGEFUNDS!!!

They borrowed money from banks for almost no interest rates no matter how the economy and inflation was, including during an unprecedented pandemic!!! For what? SHORTING Kenny style!

**Wtf??**

Now you wonder why during a pandemic the whole market was ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and up and growing right?? Inflating business with naked shares...

Using the same shitadel strategy but with money from the banks and washing everything trough citadel MM, trust bonds and dumping all the garbage in the ETFs and the trust bonds buyers.

Always betting in bankrupting the companies and then rebuying them to own pieces of the banks/federal reserve.

**So what all this changes mean?**

With Libor banks suppose to self regulate and self report and give interest rates to their customer (business, institutions, people or the government) according to how the economy is, indicators like inflation among other things. [Read about it here.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp#:~:text=LIBOR%20is%20administered%20by%20the,data%2Ddriven%2C%20layered%20method)

The banks have been manipulating this FOR A LONG TIME. Especially after 2008.

I guess they wanted to recoup their loses and because being HOLDINGS now, they wanted to be bigger and bigger.

**BOOM! The greed**

They got too greedy.... :( Even during the pandemic they gave away loans at very low and favorable rates, it was more than obvious that the economy wasn't right... they needed to raise the rates!

They didn't!!

Now they are full of this bad bad loans with subpremiun and adjustable rates, but everything was ok as long as they kept on showing those fake interest rates right?

SOFR arrives!!

SOFR was almost implemented on 2019 and almost caused a massive crisis!! **BUBBLE ALERT!**

why?

**Lets find out what SOFR means**

[What is SOFR?](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954)

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/libor-transition-to-sofr-a-brief-9557503/

Thanks to a fellow ape in the comments for providing this link ‚ù§Ô∏è

The secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR, is an influential interest rate that banks use to price U.S. dollar-denominated [derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/derivative.asp) and loans. The daily secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) is based on transactions in the [Treasury](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/introduction-treasury-securities.asp) repurchase market, where investors offer banks overnight loans backed by their bond assets.

So the interest rates are not going to be self reported by the banks, but instead the government is going to provide those rates to the banks based on the repo market.

They believe is a better option than letting the banks manipulate the rates for their advantage.

This magnificent ape made a really good post about it and thats how I found out about this problem, all credit to him!!

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos\_theory\_the\_final\_connection/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos_theory_the_final_connection/)

FROM THE **CHAOS THEORY:**

Introducing **SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate**)!!!!! This is a MASSIVE 200 trillion dollar transition that will take place over the next few years.

**OH and it almost imploded the entire fucking market the first time it was attempted to be implemented back in 2019** [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.htm)

[Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp)

brilliant ape make the [**CHAOS THEORY**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos_theory_the_final_connection/) and explains a lot of what im saying here. **A MUST READ**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos\_theory\_the\_final\_connection/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mseyai/chaos_theory_the_final_connection/)

I'll let the rest to the CHAOS THEORY, very well explained.

That's why Kenny is shorting the TREASURY BILLS, NOTES ands BOND!

He wants to profit from the banks and government to be insolvent and default!!

QUOTED FROM CHAOS THEORY:

As time progresses I believe we will see more evidence of multiple parties attempting to deleverage their positions before 2023. Coincidentally **GameStop** has just paid off all their debt that was due that exact year.

So this becomes a two pronged problem;

1. Assets are being re-hypothecated which are being used as collateral
2. Banks are providing absurd interest rates off the old LIBOR system instead of SOFR; this has resulted in the taking on a position that will be extremely difficult to get out of.

As we can see they're fighting against these changes through politics, but it appears they've brought in **Gary Gensler** to kick some ass.

We are going to be fine, a few blows to the economy and crisis but everything is going to turn down and de leverage.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

EDIT 3: Check the latest SEC speech, they seem to be focusing a lot on Libor!!! We might be onto something‚Ä¶. Or I‚Äôm I just a cOnSpIrAtOr QaNoN sHiLl!!!

SEC speech on 28 th of April!!

https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/werewolves-of-change


\-----------------------------------

**IM JACKED TO THE TITS!**

**TL;DR2 : This is my latest perception and final conclusion of this beautiful saga!**

Well.... Battle of GME is basically going to bankrupt citadel. BOOM!

It‚Äôs going be the biggest wealth distribution in history. BOOM!

There is going to be a domino and a ripple effect. (It‚Äôs not all about GME, GME is just the tip of the iceberg).

Kenny has been creating bubbles of money naked with things that does exist to Scam business and retail (among others). Its going to burst, when the bubbles burst, will have repercussions everywhere.

A lot of tendies are going to the people. That will create a lot of money going around, not just for apes but for everyone, apes will be buying things and paying off their debts and all that.

That will help reducing the leverage.

Hyperinflation is going to hit, but the government is going to be able to take it and absorb a big part trough (TIPS) [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tips.asp)

People and apes are not going to care much about the raise in pricing (inflation) because we will have money and wealth around, huge economy stimulus (Thanks you citadel for the tendies!).

A huge chunk of money will come to the banks initially, people paying their credit card and loans and mortgages.

Then tax will come and Uncle Sam will get half of our tendies (if helps the economy not to boom boom im fine!).

Then things will be stable then and hopefully lot cleaner after.

This is necessary and healthy to Happen, stock is trading sideways to prepare for all that.

**This is why I think is low volume and trading sideways lately**

Stock is trading sideways because RC needed to to pay the debt and be free from banks leverage.

Also gather money for the transformation, ! he already did !.

Also trading still low allow more Apes to jump in!! RC care for us and everyone. Ohhh PAPA RC.

The DTCC needs time to firewall and protect the banks from Kenny and friends predators.

Once everything is in place and the scam is suppressed, the huge winners are going be the banks and the federal reserve. But us apes going to ride the rollercoaster all along getting tendies!!

I won‚Äôt be surprised if the catalyst is RC announcing a recall, investigation or a crypto dividend on the meeting.

My smooth brain tells me the catalyst is the Libor to SOFR, always been for me.

The voting is big because they will have grounds to show the amount of shorting and fukery.

So be patient and don‚Äôt be scared. HOLD THE LINE!

This needs to be done and Kenny needs to be stopped because is making bubbles everywhere in the market is damaging shareholders, the companies and THE ECONOMY!!
