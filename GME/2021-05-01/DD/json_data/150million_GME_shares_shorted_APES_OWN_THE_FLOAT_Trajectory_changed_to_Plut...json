    "selftext": "\nFirst, before you start reading I\u2019d like you to read the post linked below that gives you an idea of how many apes there are worldwide holding GME or just look over the chart/picture that gives you the estimated numbers at the very least. Secondly, this post is kind of long and might get confusing but bare with me and I\u2019ll try to make it as simple as possible, also it\u2019s important you look over the links when you get to that part of the reading so you can understand everything as easily possible. Thirdly, if you\u2019d rather just skip over all the reading, scroll to the end of each part for the speculated numbers of shares. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nOkay now that you\u2019ve done that, one can estimate there are at-least 5 million apes worldwide if you take the \u201cmoderate\u201d route from the link above. \nWell how does one find the float that apes own from this? Well you\u2019d first have to find how many shares each ape owns and multiply that by the number of apes that own GME (shares x shareholders.) Considering that it\u2019s impossible to get the exact numbers since there are millions of synthetic shares out there; you\u2019ll have to use estimates, a little bit of your ape brain, and use the average # of shares per ape to figure out the float/shares apes own. \n\nOkay now there are couple ways to estimate what the average # of shares per ape is and how many shares of GME apes own. In this post you\u2019ll consider some of those possibilities in three different parts.\n\nPart one: \n\nFirst, you can start easy and guesstimate using common sense and say the majority of apes have atleast been buying one share per week since February when the price fell back down to earth from the rocket that was taking off. To ensure the least amount of error let\u2019s just say every ape started buying one share per week on the second week of February and not the first or in January, even though most have been buying since January and holding. From the 8th of February it has been 12 weeks up to today May 1st. So if apes have been buying one share per week, then apes would have an average of 12 shares per ape, not even considering the shares they were buying prior to this or considering that they might\u2019ve bought more then one per week. Using this method you can estimate apes own 60 million shares of the float.\n\n (12 x 5,000,000= 60,000,000) \n\nPart 2:\n\nYou might ask yourself, why don\u2019t I just ask the apes how many shares they hold to get the average? Brilliant idea, so I did exactly that in my last post. However, this is where it gets tricky and the most amount of error can happen, since there is no possible way for one to get every single ape to respond or tell me the exact shares they hold. But it hasn\u2019t all gone in vain, this can show you the magnitude of this whole thing and why they might even be trying to keep this thing under the radar. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n1kqk6/the_average_of_shares_each_ape_holds/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nOkay now let\u2019s talk numbers, from the link you can estimate most apes hold xx-xxx shares (double to triple digits.) Also considering only 3 apes commented x out of the 30 total, you know there is no way the average is under 9 shares (single digit.) You might think well xx-xxx is a broad area, and you would be absolutely right. 10-999 average shares doesn\u2019t give you anything but a broad area of what the average could be. However, it does tell you couple things. \n\n1. There is no way the average is under 10 shares. \n\n2. The average is anywhere from 10-999 (it\u2019s a wide range but it\u2019s a start)\n\n3. Using these numbers the true float is anywhere from 50million to 4.995 Billion. \n\n4. Read that last part again.\n\nOkay now I\u2019m not gonna jump on the high horse and say that from the 10-999 number you can get an average of 500 or so. We know there are certainly some apes who can afford/have that many shares or more; however, most apes can\u2019t afford that. So I will low ball it and say apes have an average of \u201c30-50\u201d shares per ape to ensure the least amount of error in my calculations and hypothesis. \n\n\u201cThe numbers mason! What do they mean??\u201d\n\nUsing the 30-50 average you can estimate apes hold 150million-250million shares of GME.\n\n (30 x 5,000,000= 150,000,000)\n\n (50 x 5,000,000= 250,000,000) \n\nI\u2019m using 5 million apes from the first link as the standard for each of these calculations, but there certainly could be a lot more apes out there (more on that in the next part.)\n\nPart 3: \n\nThis part takes in the more speculative side of all this, which considers into it other possibilities. Now I\u2019ve given you some numbers to think about but what if I\u2019m wrong what if there are more or less apes out there worldwide. Well let\u2019s consider there are only 3 million apes out there in the worst case scenario. Using 3 million apes as the standard for the first part, apes would still own 36 million shares, as for the second part apes would still hold 90-150million shares of GME. Using the worst case scenario apes still own the float by a mile, there is no negative here if you were looking for one. \n\nNow that the shills are gone, let\u2019s speculate there are more apes out there worldwide, 10 million+ which is not out of the picture in any means since I\u2019ve have been moderate with the numbers up till now. \n\nTaking in the fact there are 149,928,000 total users/retail investors in all the brokers worldwide combined (first link supports this number), it\u2019s not out of the ordinary to estimate that 6.7% of those total users have become apes holding GME/AMC shares over the past couple months. Therefore, if you went with the theory that there are 10 million apes worldwide you would have 120million shares held by apes using the first parts average, and 300million to 500million shares held by apes using the second parts average. \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\n\n1st part: \n\n(12 x 10,000,000= 120,000,000)\n\n2nd part:\n\n(30 x 10,000,000= 300,000,000)\n\n(50 x 10,000,000= 500,000,000) \n\n\n\n\nPart 4 (last part):\n\nThis brings me to another important topic. I don\u2019t believe they ever planned on covering after January when it started getting out of their control and now they want the government to come in and save them or take the whole system down with them, the SEC and DTCC are losing their shit not knowing what do with all these fake shares that don\u2019t exist or where to get the trillions of dollars they\u2019ll need to help the hedgies cover. That\u2019s probably why GME has traded almost flat over the past couple weeks, shat on by every media outlet, and the reason why no \u201cmajor\u201d DTCC rule has passed that could trigger a squeeze they can\u2019t control. \n\nThe floor is no longer a million on the moon, it\u2019s fucking Pluto at 20 million now.\n\nI wanna end this by saying this has quite literally gone the best way possible. 1. The manipulation over the past couple months has taught retail investors more then they could in years time. 2. It being dragged out for this long has been getting most paperhands to fold now so they don\u2019t stop apes from going to pluto later. 3. The bots/shills and fake news have taught apes not to fall for FUD or trust the media and will ensure apes don\u2019t fall for it when the \ud83d\ude80 starts. 4. The longer this goes on the more they short= bigger gamma squeeze. 5. Investors learned the SEC and DTCC are bought out and corrupted agency\u2019s that need to be reformed. 6. It has taught apes patience and brought apes together for many good causes. 7. Apes have brought more of a change and justice to this manipulated market then anyone ever has and it let the hedge funds know they are not invincible and apes together are stronger then any of them.\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\n\n(None of this is financial advice, please always do your own Due Diligence)\n\nEdit: An ape was kind enough to link me this post below which further supports the second and third part of the post concerning apes holding 30-50 shares average (It actually states a lot more then I have put.)\nAlso, I could have linked a lot more DD and actually wanted to do another couple parts considering other things like Darkpool/OTC shares and how that\u2019s been used to short GME, but ape brain can only handle so much, especially at once in a single post. I would love to make more posts about other things you guys might want to hear or know about so let me know in the comments what you would like me to cover and I\u2019ll dig into it for future posts.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzuodo/final_update_superstonk_users_alone_hold_between/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nTLDR: \n\nI didn\u2019t know you apes thought TLDR was this important I\u2019m sorry\ud83d\ude22. Anyways, TLDR is there\u2019s at least around 5 million apes out there and together they own the float!! No not the amount that the media has told you or the info they released to the public, not at all, but more like 150 million+ shares worth. In the first 3 parts I talk about about the different ways you can estimate the amount of shares apes hold. You get different estimates from each method, first part: 60 million, second part: 90-150million, and third part: 300 million to 500 million. This has changed the game and made PLUTO (20 million) the new floor, given the fact I used a pretty moderate average in each of the calculations and even low balled a lot to account for any errors one could think of. Last part talks about why everything being dragged out for months has been good for apes and the simplified reason of why GME has been trading flat and squeeze has not started yet. Hodl.",
