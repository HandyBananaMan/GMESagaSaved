I'm typing this to explain the situation regarding Revolut sell limits on shares because I saw a post that blew up and said you can't place limits over 10K which is wrong.

Revolut will let you sell at whatever sell limit you want as long as you have ***whole*** shares and you sell the max amount of them.

Example:

I have 10 GME shares on revolut and I want to sell them at $1.000.000. I can make that my sell limit and then try to sell all 10 of my shares and that works. If I tried to sell 9 of my 10 shares i'll get a message telling me that I can't sell a number of my shares for more than $10.000.

For ***fractional*** shares's holders, that means that you will have to either make your shares whole. (e.g if you have 9.3 shares you will have to buy 0.7 more), or sell that fractional share (e.g 0.3 for previous example) at market price. And after that place the sell limit that you want for the rest of your shares.

The problem with that is that you can't have an exit strategy with more than 1 exit point. The only exit is by selling all of the shares at the same price and at the same time.

As always this is NO FINANCIAL ADVICE, I eat crayons, yum yum tasty. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Excuse me for my bad english, it's not my first language.

EDIT: According to u/loveclastur that messaged me and u/istros that posted a comment, there is limit of 5MIL USD on limit orders right now.

EDIT2: Something I didn't think of importance is that ***LIMIT ORDERS IN REVOLUT EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE DAY.*** That means that you will have to put a new limit order everyday if you want to have a limit order set.
