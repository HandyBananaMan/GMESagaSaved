The general sentiment of GME has shifted to beyond bullish at this point.

We know they lost.

They know they lost.

Vast majority of this sub are probably balls deep in GME at this point. There's a ton of DD to confidently invest in the stock, but what does it matter if one has already bought all the shares they are capable of.

With all the evidence pointing to an inevitable squeeze I'm confident that they're afraid that it gets out. Right now everyone and their mother has probably heard of GME but all they hear is the bullshit from MSM. Now image if users of r/all were daily exposed to GME posts with headlines such as these. 

(Just copied a couple random ones from the past week)

*  **This week, and why I am at $2,000,000 minimum. (Now $3mil)** 
*   **My Dad who was vehemently anti-GME in January bought his first share today!! The doubters are starting to believe!!! 💎🙌📈🚀** 
*  **🚀Get Ready For The Biggest Short Squeeze Of Your Lifetime🚀** 
*  **🚨IMPORTANT🚨 ALL apes need to read this to prepare for squeeze, or risk potentially losing profit!** 

At some point you'd have to check out what the fuck was going on with r/GME and slowly more and more people would understand. More people understanding means more upvotes, means spreading fastere, means more shares for retail untill they can't contain the buying power anymore and it moons.

This would also explain the mass reports of the famous apes among us. Those would be the people most likely to push us to the front page because they consistently get upvotes at a rate that almost ensures their posts going viral and hitting r/all.

Welp... Not like it matters. They're just buying more time for their bonuses to go through.

See you all on the moon. **🚀🚀🚀**

Godspeed. 💎👐
