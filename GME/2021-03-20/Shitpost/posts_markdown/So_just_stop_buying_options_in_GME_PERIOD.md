Whales are getting tired of buy walling us up to keep options above a certain price!!! Anyways, I hate options in GME. Don’t you? I do. Shit costs a lot!!!! Hint!!!! Get it?!? All your OTC is what made GROSS his money!!! What did he say??? Oh, yeah... “I made money SELLING options. Not buying!!!” 10 mil selling! Pssssh, ITM calls or shares fucking Caesars!!! Not financial advice at all just pure frustration!!! Fuck Valhalla! (No disrespect Odin) but I need a trip to that moon so I can see Optimus Prime bruh!!!
