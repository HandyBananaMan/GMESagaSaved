<p>I don’t want things,
I don’t want to party all the time,
I don’t even want the bragging rights.</p>
<p>I just want to be able to live a life where I get to do what I want. </p>
<p>I don’t want to break my back anymore. Working for some shitty corporation that doesn’t care about me and pays me peanuts while I break my back, yet some higher ups make 10 times what I make for sitting on their ass.</p>
<p>I want this to work for the freedom it can bring us. Imagine what we could do if we didn’t have our enthusiasm beaten out of us. </p>
<p>Hold.</p>
