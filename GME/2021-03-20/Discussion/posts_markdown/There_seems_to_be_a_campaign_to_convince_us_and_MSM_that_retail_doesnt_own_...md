There is a significant push on here and WSB not to post positions because the hedge funds will have an idea of how many shares we own. IMHO, this is ridiculous because just about every broker sells your information to anyone who will buy it, especially the hedge funds. They, without a doubt, know exactly how many shares retail has. The problem is retail doesn’t have this information. 

So, how can it be possible that retail doesn’t own a significant portion of the float? It’s not possible. GME is the most discussed stock on WSB daily. WSB has 9 million members, there literally has to only be an average 5 shares/member to capture the entire float with the float at 45 million. 

On top of that, do you really think that WSB members aren’t convincing their brothers, mothers, fathers to buy a few shares? If they convince their family to buy an average of 5 shares, we are now up to 90 million shares. 200% of the float and I think these are low ball estimates. Given that we have seen countless posts with people owning hundreds and thousands of shares these are very low ball estimates. 

I see people every day with low karma and new accounts aggressively pushing this narrative that we don’t own a significant portion of the float. Some people really have an interest in this. I think it’s to prevent MSM on reporting on how popular this stock really is, which is exactly what is happening. This is one less catalyst for the squeeze. If I were a hedge fund manager, I wouldn’t want anyone knowing the percentage of the float retail owns. 

TL;DR: FWIW, I think RETAIL IS THE WHALE HERE. The hedge funds don’t want you to know that retail owns the float. This is perfect as part of a FUD campaign.

Edit: We know that they are scanning Reddit for stock tickers. What they are looking for is sentiment. They want to know what stocks you will buy when  your next paycheck comes in so that they can establish a position ahead of you. They already know what you currently own.

Edit 2: What happened to the price after DFV posted his double down position?

Edit 3: This ape used math to come to the conclusion that retail owns the float. DD courtesy of u/InForTheSqueeze
