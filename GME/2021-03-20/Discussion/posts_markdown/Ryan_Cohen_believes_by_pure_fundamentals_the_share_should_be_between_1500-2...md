According to RC's letter https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf He believes the share by pure fundamentals should be between 1500-2000 USD.

So if I did the math correctly he said by 2023 GME would have a big share of the 200 billions of the gaming industry. (Let's plays devil's advocate and say GME gets 50% of that market) then we have 100 B divided by 70 MM = ~1425 USD a share ! And right now is 200 USD that's a x7 initial investment in 2 years ! And that's without the squeeze??? My hands hurt a bit kinda like becoming ðŸ’Ž

 I'm definitely going long on the stock.
