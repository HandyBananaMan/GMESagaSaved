<p>This has been my plan all along, but people need to realise one thing, GME is a legitimately good company.</p>
<p>So when the squeeze is squoze and you have your millions, shot a 100k back into the back end and wait for the stock split, then wait for the stock to rise and get even richerer.</p>
<p>I'd be surprised if the stock dropped back below $500, and I think 1k might be more probable, but I'm speculating here. The following point is still true.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So settle down kids, it's story time.</p>
<p><strong>-------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>squeeze is sqouze</li>
<li>you cash out at 1.5m/2m a share</li>
<li>you buy back in at the backend, lets say 500</li>
<li>you put in 100k per pre-squeeze share</li>
<li>you get back 200 shares for every pre-squeeze share</li>
<li>daddy cohen does a 10:1 stock split</li>
<li>you now have 2000 shares per pre-squeeze share</li>
<li>price is now $50, but you have 2000 shares, you still have 100k worth of stock</li>
<li>price goes up $10 to 60</li>
<li>you now have 120k worth of stock</li>
<li>price continues to rise to $100</li>
<li>you now have 200k worth of stock</li>
<li>but you originally had 5 shares</li>
<li>so times that 200k by 5</li>
<li>you now have another million</li>
<li>you've millionaired yourself twice</li>
<li>welcome to the high life</li>
<li><strong>----- bonus round -----</strong></li>
<li>BUT WHAT'S THIS?! NANI?!!</li>
<li>You're used to holding now, you have millions already so you think fuck it i'll leave it in, see what happens.</li>
<li>stock rises to 200, you now have 2 million</li>
<li>stock rises to 500, you now have 5 million</li>
<li>stock rises to 1000, you now have 10 million</li>
<li>stock hits a sell wall at 1500, you have 15 million</li>
<li>meh, you're diamond as fuck now, you just stand outside of your mansion waving at passers by all day, you're made of diamond, there's fuck all else to do, you're like a living diamond statue</li>
<li>price drops to 850, ydgaf</li>
<li>price rebounds to 2000 you now have 20 million</li>
<li><strong>----- EPILOGUE -----</strong></li>
<li>the year is 2035, gamestop has now monopolised the gaming industry, you can order a game, a pizza, and an ounce of hindu kush, it'll all be delivered within 30 minutes, you're also entered into a raffle for another free pizza, dime bag or chance at winning the new Microny Playbox IV, life is good.</li>
<li>You sit down to get blazed, enjoy your pizza and have an awesome night gaming when an alert flows through the gaia field, you tune in psychonetically to the twitter-verse.</li>
<li>Daddy Cohen stands before you in his holographic glory.</li>
<li>He's doing a 5:1 split...</li>
