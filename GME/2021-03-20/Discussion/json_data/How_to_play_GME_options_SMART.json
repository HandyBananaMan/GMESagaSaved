    "selftext": "DON'T. Stop trying to hit lottery tickets on calls. I've been guilty of this myself. GME is already a lottery ticket with a HIGH likelihood to print. Not only are you exposing yourself to way more risk by trying to time it, if these calls are being written by MMs or HFs and sold to apes, then that's an insane amount of premium that could have otherwise gone towards locking down float which is now keeping them solvent. The longer they're solvent the lower our chance at mooning goes.\n\nStay retarded, but not that retarded. No more options until this is done.\n\nPeace out apes.\n\nSee /u/King_Esot3ric's comment for a more detailed discussion about risk/reward.",
