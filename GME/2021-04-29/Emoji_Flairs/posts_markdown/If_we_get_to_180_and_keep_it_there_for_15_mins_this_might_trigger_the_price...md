# Title: If we get to $180 and keep it there for 15 mins this might trigger the price to hit above $200. Now there's a ton of heavy contracts the expire tomorrow at the $200 mark (just above 14 million shares at play). This might be the reason they don't want us to pass the $180 price. Just my opinion
