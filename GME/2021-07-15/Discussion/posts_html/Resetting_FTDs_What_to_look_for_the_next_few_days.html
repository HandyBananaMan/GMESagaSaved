<p>Want to do more to help combat financial crime? Over the next few days millions of shares need to be reset for hedge funds to avoid FTDs.</p>
<p>One way they are doing this could be through married puts. This is where a HF buys an ITM or ATM call and exercises it immediately. They couple it with a deep OTM put like the ones we are seeing expire tomorrow.</p>
<p>This has been flagged by the SEC as a problem in hard to borrow stocks.

<p>We have started spotting these over the last couple of days. On Monday around 5,000 calls were created and exercised immediately and another load have been spotted today at the $130 and $140 price mark.</p>
<p>If you see ITM calls being created and exercised, try to screenshot the evidence. The SEC risk alert I linked above has a tip line.</p>
