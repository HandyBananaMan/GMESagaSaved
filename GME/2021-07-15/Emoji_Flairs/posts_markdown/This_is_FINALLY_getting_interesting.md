Apes,

All of us have a stake in something genuinely valuable.  The price of shares are dropping dramatically just in the pre-market right now.   I’m anticipating further drops.  Don’t be discouraged!  The integrity of this community is being challenged by a handful who stand to lose trillions and trillions of dollars.  No matter what price the manipulators determine the value your stake.  We know what we own.  Collectively, we’ve got them by the balls.  This community has held for 6 months, and now we get to show Wall Street, the hedge funds, the banks…hell, even the ‘regulators’, just how far our patience and endurance can go.  HODL on to your stakes Apes and please don’t let go!   APES OWN THIS GAME.  Time = money. The adversaries are running out of both.
