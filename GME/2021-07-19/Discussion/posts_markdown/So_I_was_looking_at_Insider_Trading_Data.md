Recently, I came accross this website ([https://www.dataroma.com/](https://www.dataroma.com/)) that tracks the holdings of superinvestors ( aka Warren, Kathy etc) and also lets you track the recent buying and selling of stocks from insiders(CEOs, Directors etc). This is where it gets interesting. 

As I was looking at the buying/selling ratio of the last few months, you can see that historically there is a buy/sell ratio ranging between 1:1.5 and 1:2.5. Super normal things.

![Last year's buy\/sell ratio is 1\/2.2](https://preview.redd.it/21x22w6e36c71.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=449d34ad157e926839d17416c87991faa018a1d5)

![Last 6 months buy:sell ratio is 1\/1.35 - Most balanced so far](https://preview.redd.it/6xzml38i36c71.png?width=1541&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d69b8c373f05e6935bf566d31978a938ea49bcf)

So the last 6 months look pretty balanced, right? For every selling there is almost one buying happening. Something like Yin Yang. Super balanced.

**WRONG**

If you deep a bit deeper you can see some abnormalities happening the most recent weeks. Abnormalities that make you think that people who know things have started jumping ship early.

**This is the data for the last month:**

&#x200B;

![Last month's buy\/sell ratio is 1\/7.7](https://preview.redd.it/kivxwr1l46c71.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bbcf8964e3b950c95440a510bbc49cab7d3e51)

Well, in the last month they've been much more people selling than buying apparently. 7.7 times more. So let's go to the final step, let's see what has been happening during the past week. Drum roll please....

&#x200B;

![WOW! Past week's buy\/sell ratio is 1\/21.3](https://preview.redd.it/xmv3b6ha56c71.png?width=1567&format=png&auto=webp&s=7caa993c7f5c4124134cacad5b0cec776423358e)

Well, things got heated past week, amarait?

21 times more selling than buying? Damn, nobody believes in their companies nowadays?

If someone was more suspicious than me, he would say that quite a lot of people seem to be jumping ship the last few days. They must be either seeing something bad coming or....? I don't know.

I don't know shit about the stock market or TA but I think a good technical indicator that something is going tits up is when there are A LOT of insiders selling. Maybe something exciting is coming soon.. Buckle upðŸš€

Please don't take financial advise from me I am so dumb that I put weight clips on the Smith machine.
