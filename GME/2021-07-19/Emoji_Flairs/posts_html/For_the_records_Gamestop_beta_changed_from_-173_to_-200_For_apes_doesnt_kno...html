<h1>Title: For the records: Gamestop beta changed from -1.73 to -2.00; For apes doesn't know, beta is the correlation of the price to the whole market. -2.00 beta means, if the market goes $1 down, $GME will go $2 up and vice versa. Finally $GME is perfect investment to hedge against market crash.</h1>
