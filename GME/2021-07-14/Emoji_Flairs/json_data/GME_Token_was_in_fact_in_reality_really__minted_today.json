GME Token was minted today. you have to go back to the **contract source code.**\n\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e#code)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovui85fvjab71.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b6ab429d99f61ca830fd6f42010434088a19073\n\nThis specific section of the contract code was programmed in here from the beginning to launch at the timestamp **1626261600.** The code says that at this specific timestamp (today) to automatically run and create an EVENT to Mint GME Token - 1 of Token ID \\[0\\] . The Timestamp: 50 days 21 hrs ago (May-25-2021) was when the contract source code was written. However, the event script was already written in the source code since May-25-2021 and was set to run when the date/time hit the launchDate (1626261600). Thus, no human intervention was needed for the scripted event to happened-- it was programmed to happen on its own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x89df343d7e245d42a09de2c790c8c471a0956f32b55631a53a15268c56a74c2d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x89df343d7e245d42a09de2c790c8c471a0956f32b55631a53a15268c56a74c2d)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nnqvlnfwjab71.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=f242f668cde4f3174454945edbad109da9483477\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, going back to the source code:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3skolu4zjab71.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f2253d75b442f8e044b664798923f6d83ee1d80\n\nThis line right here **\"mint(owner, 0)\"** assigns the owner **\"0x10B16eEDe03cF73CbF44e4BFFFa3e6BFf36F1Fad\"** with 0 (ZERO) GME Supply.
