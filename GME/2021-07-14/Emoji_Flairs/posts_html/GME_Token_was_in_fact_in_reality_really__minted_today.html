<p>Your wrong. GME Token was minted today. you have to go back to the <strong>contract source code.</strong></p>

<p>This specific section of the contract code was programmed in here from the beginning to launch at the timestamp <strong>1626261600.</strong> The code says that at this specific timestamp (today) to automatically run and create an EVENT to Mint GME Token - 1 of Token ID [0] . The Timestamp: 50 days 21 hrs ago (May-25-2021) was when the contract source code was written. However, the event script was already written in the source code since May-25-2021 and was set to run when the date/time hit the launchDate (1626261600). Thus, no human intervention was needed for the scripted event to happened-- it was programmed to happen on its own.</p>

<p>Now, going back to the source code:</p>

<p>This line right here <strong>"mint(owner, 0)"</strong> assigns the owner <strong>"0x10B16eEDe03cF73CbF44e4BFFFa3e6BFf36F1Fad"</strong> with 0 (ZERO) GME Supply. Total GME Supply will not range(1, inf) because this does not represent the # of NFT tokens. It will remain at ZERO because the “OWNER” has the only (ZERO) supply hence the phrase -- “The one and only.”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Instead, the NFTs will have its own TOKEN_ID which can be found in the “Inventory” section: The starting index which could be found at the bottom of this page where it says <strong>Token ID: 0</strong></p>
