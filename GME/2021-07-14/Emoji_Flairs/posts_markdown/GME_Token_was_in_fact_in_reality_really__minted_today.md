Your wrong. GME Token was minted today. you have to go back to the **contract source code.**

This specific section of the contract code was programmed in here from the beginning to launch at the timestamp **1626261600.** The code says that at this specific timestamp (today) to automatically run and create an EVENT to Mint GME Token - 1 of Token ID \[0\] . The Timestamp: 50 days 21 hrs ago (May-25-2021) was when the contract source code was written. However, the event script was already written in the source code since May-25-2021 and was set to run when the date/time hit the launchDate (1626261600). Thus, no human intervention was needed for the scripted event to happened-- it was programmed to happen on its own.

Now, going back to the source code:

This line right here **"mint(owner, 0)"** assigns the owner **"0x10B16eEDe03cF73CbF44e4BFFFa3e6BFf36F1Fad"** with 0 (ZERO) GME Supply. Total GME Supply will not range(1, inf) because this does not represent the # of NFT tokens. It will remain at ZERO because the “OWNER” has the only (ZERO) supply hence the phrase -- “The one and only.”

&#x200B;

Instead, the NFTs will have its own TOKEN\_ID which can be found in the “Inventory” section: The starting index which could be found at the bottom of this page where it says **Token ID: 0**
