    "selftext": "**TL;DR: based on the FINRA daily short ~~interest~~ volume report, it is mathematically impossible for short interest to be less than 418% of the entire float (979% of tradeable float) and could be more than 525% of the entire float (1230% of tradeable float). I personally believe it is more because 1) the data set is very conservative and 2) because I also believe S3 lied about 140%+ short interest closing on the weekend of January 23 and 24.** \n\nI saw [this post] (https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ok2szi/think_they_didnt_short_the_house_yesterday_short/) this morning which highlighted how GME had the highest percent daily short ~~interest~~ volume over the past ~6-7 months, which clocked in at 72%. High number and outpaced what we\u2019ve seen previously. \n\nLooking at the chart, I had a wrinkle come and go like a fart on the wind: the daily short ~~interest~~ volume has been ~40%+ for six months. Monthly short reported interest is ~14.19%--a month-over-month decline from over 20% in January (according to S3's numbers). If I\u2019m not mistaken, daily short ~~interest~~ volume and total short positions cannot jive unless 1) all long interest since January went to closing short positions and/or 2) short interest holders are hiding short interest (they're probably lying and also hiding short interest using synthetic longs). The first option isn't valid. I know I\u2019ve bought, others have verifiably bought (e.g.: posted screenshots), yet others have unverifiably bought (there are daily posts about increasing positions), and still others have unverifiably and silently bought. So true short interest is hidden and not being accurately reported in bi-monthly reporting (and rebroadcast).\n\nI think we can get a rough idea of the order of magnitude of short interest from publicly available data without speculation and ignoring synthetic long positions. I aim to do that. The benefit of that approach is that everyone at home can follow along with me! I\u2019m also going to take this step by step in case anything I state is wrong. Please correct me!\n\nMy data sources:\n\n1)\t[FINRA daily short volume data for GME] (https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily). THIS DATA IS INCOMPLETE! Notably, the short ~~interest~~ volume data is **only reported daily data to FINRA and not information held by exchanges.** Total volume is the total volume. I\u2019m also ignoring short exempt volume. All of that is good! **The short volume presented here is the most conservative volume number since it can\u2019t be lower.** *Caveat: exchanges have shown negative volume, but I assume not negative short volume?*\n\nTotal volume from January 25, 2021-on: \t1,055,013,969\n\nTotal short volume from January 25, 2021-on:\t544,275,534\n\n2)\tDaily buying data \u2013 I\u2019m being a little lazy for this one and using info posted to this sub for Fidelity buy data, but other trading platforms also support it. By order volume, there\u2019s been at least a 75%:25% buy to sell ratio, but typically more. To be conservative and because I don\u2019t have vast polling data for this, I\u2019m going to assume a flat 3:1 buy to sell ratio for the entire time period under evaluation. What does that mean? For every 1 sell order, there are 3 buyers. The volume nets out, but this shows that retail is gobbling up shares.  \n\n3)\tWho\u2019s holding what shifted \u2013 Based on Bloomberg Terminal data (comparing 5/2 to 7/8):\n\n* Investment Advisor positions dropped by 12.9% (accounting for 50.78% of float)\n* Venture Capital positions increased by 104.46% (accounting for 20.18% of float)\n* Hedge Fund positions decreased by 77.76% (accounting for 1.85% of float)\n* Individual positions increased by 17.91% (accounting for 7.11% of float)\n* \u201cOther\u201d positions increased by 104.5% (accounting for 10% of float)\n* Brokerage positions decreased by 46.95% (accounting for 2.61% of float)\n* Pension Fund increased by 21.64% (accounting for 2.08% of float)\n\n4)\tAccording to S3 partners, January 23 and 24 saw shorts close a short volume of 140%+ (reported at 226% at one point). That is a Saturday and Sunday. Since no one called me to ask for my shares at the time, I can only assume I\u2019m part of the 14% who\u2019s a bag-holder. Also, since short positions are eliminated when pared with a long\u2014and synthetic longs created by naked shorts would just evaporate\u2014I can only assume because the entire float didn\u2019t turn over twice (again, I still have my shares), that that claim is bullshit. BUT for purposes of this discussion, we\u2019ll optionally assume it\u2019s true.\n\n**Situation 1: shorts covered on a weekend** *I walk through three iterations here - one where all long volume is shorts covering, one where long interests only consume a portion of long volume, and finally one where long interests consume a portion of all volume. The final iteration is the true short interest, but this is the process I used and wanted to walk everyone through it in case there is an error.*\n\n* According to S3, short interest dropped from 140%+ to 20% on the weekend of January 23-24. \n* Since January 25, short volume has been *at least* 51.59% of all volume. So even if all long positions are shorts covering new short positions and there was no retail purchasing since January 25, we\u2019re up 33.54 million in short positions (544,275,534 short volume \u2013 510,738,435 long volume). So at the IMPOSSIBLY VERY MINIMUM short interest must be 48,417,099 shares or 65.08% of float (20% after the January \u201ccovering\u201d plus additional impossible-to-cover short volume). That is 458.63% higher than currently bi-weekly reported short interest. Notably, institutions (which have not sold) and insiders hold 57.3% of the float. Assuming that\u2019s locked up, the reported traded float is 31.77 million. So on a daily reported basis, 152.40% of the tradable float is shorted. AGAIN, THAT\u2019S ASSUMING ALL 48.41% OF LONG VOLUME IS SHORTS CLOSING. \n* As identified above, Venture Capital, Other, and Individuals have substantially increased their positions. This is where it becomes a little difficult for me to quantify what that amount is. I think what we can say is that over time X % of volume was purchases used to increase holdings from Y% to Z%, if there was growth, which is long volume not consumed by shorts covering. Based on that:\na) Venture capital increased holdings from 9.87% to 20.18% of float, or a change of 10.31% of float, which should correspond to volume traded. So 10.31% of long volume for the time period (510,737,435) is 52,657,029 trades. \nb) Other \u2013 5.11% of long volume or 26,098,682 trades.\nc) Individuals \u2013 1.08% of long volume or 5,515,975 trades.\ne) Pension Funds - 0.37% of long volume or 1,889,732 trades.\n\n * In total, that\u2019s 86,161,418 trades, or 16.87% of long volume. Subtracting that from the long volume in the prior bullet, only 31.54% of long volume could have possibly been used to close short positions. So that changes the equation to 544,275,534 \u2013 332,751,405 = 211,524,129 short volume not covered. The VERY MINIMUM short interest at this iteration is 224,804,129 or 302% of float (20% after the January \u201ccovering\u201d plus additional impossible-to-cover short volume). Since the tradeable float is 31.77 million, the short interest is 707% of tradeable float. \n\n* Venture Capital, Other, Individuals, and Pension Funds aren\u2019t just buying 16.87% of long positions, they\u2019re buying 16.87% of all positions, including short positions. Those short positions then can\u2019t be used to close other shorts if locked up with VC, other, individuals and pension funds. That can be expressed either by adding to short volume or subtracting from long volume. Either expresses that 1) a short is created and 2) a short isn\u2019t closed. So that means a total of 177,980,856 volume was consumed just by VC, other, individuals, and pension funds. This iteration of the equation then comes to 544,275,534 \u2013 246,589,987 = 297,685,547 short volume not covered. At this iteration, the VERY MINIMUM short interest is 310,965,547 or 418% of the float (20% after the January \u201ccovering\u201d plus additional impossible-to-cover short volume). Since the tradeable float is 31.77 million, the short interest is 979% of tradeable float.\n\n**Situation 2: shorts didn\u2019t cover on a weekend**\n\n* Let\u2019s assume for a minute that S3 is full of shit and no shorts covered on the 23rd to 24th. Short interest remained at 140%+ on January 25 and I\u2019ll cap it at 140% since we don\u2019t have reliable higher #s from that date. So the short interest on January 25 was 92.96 million shares. If you want to go with the 226% number bandied about, that would be 168,144,000. Please do that math yourself. \n\n* If all long volume is shorts covering \u2013 short interest is 141,337,099 or 189% of float / 445% of tradeable float. \n\n* If increased purchasing reduces shorts covering on long positions only \u2013 short interest is 304,484,129 or 409% of float / 958% of tradeable float.\n\n* If increased purchasing reduces shorts covering on all positions \u2013 short interest is 390,645,547 or 525% of float / 1230% of tradeable float.\n\n**Edited where interest/volume usage is incorrect**\n\n**Edit 2:** this is in the comments, but I also wanted to include this up here for transparency and for folks to poke holes further. I think my analysis accounts for some of the issues with using short volume to calculate short interest. I think my analysis does so because I'm looking at aggregate volume that is persistently short, calculated from publicly reported position changes, based on one exchange's volume, as compared to GME's float. I believe that avoids the \"pitfalls\" of calculating short interest via short volume using one data source.\n\nI found this [publication from FINRA] (https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019) which outlines three reasons not to rely on short volume for short interest. Those boil down to:\n\n*1) A firm will sell short to accommodate a long sale position for their clients and only the short transaction is recorded if the firm has no position or already has an open short position.* Looking at the available Bloomberg data, there's a gross increase of reported positions by 0.57% for the 5/2/21 - 7/8/21 time period. Since that's what I used for long positions, I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say that there aren't many of these trades. I think this is especially true where sales were logged by Hedge Funds and Investment Advisors who hold the shares in custody in their name (or a fund they've created on behalf of a client), not in the client's name.\n\n*2)  FINRA data is only FINRA data.* I assumed the FINRA total volume was canonical and it is not; it's just FINRA data. The total volume is 4x higher at 4,459,268,264. Unfortunately, NYSE and NASDAQ require payment for that information on their exchanges. CBOE puts it into daily excel files which aren't easily searchable.\n\nThat being said, I don't think that undercuts my analysis. Instead of looking at percentages based on volume within the FINRA data (e.g.: short FINRA volume as a percentage of total volume), I'm looking at total volume that is a persistent short position logged by FINRA (so short FINRA volume not cancelled by corresponding long FINRA volume) as a percentage of GME float. So based on the persistent reported short volume as a percentage of GME float, we're able to arrive at a low-ball GME short interest. NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE, etc. would add to that since I'm isolating volume to exchange.\n\n*3) Transient short positions are reported.* If I sell 100 shares short in the morning and buy 100 shares in the afternoon, that logs as short volume and long volume. I think that's consistent with my analysis: it's a short position that opens and then is closed and the volume nets out. By looking at the delta over time for short volume and long volume, that position nets out even if closed later. What doesn't net out is short volume that is never netted out with long volume...so aggregate short volume.\n\n**Edit3:** I'm emboldened by a challenge in the comments to find another \"normal\" ticker to compare against. I did so with autozone (AZO), as suggested. By the way, how the hell is that trading at ~$1570/share? Missed opportunity! My results are here. Please tell me more \"normal\" tickers so I may form a better baseline!\n\nAccording to FINRA, the total short sale volume is 6.1 million since 7/14/20. The total volume over that period is 12.51 million.\n\nTaking long volume (6.4 million) and subtracting short sale volume leaves us with a short interest of 294,888. Given that free float is 21.46 million, that's 1.37% short interest. Incidentally, that's half of the reported short interest, according to Marketwatch, of 438,900. That seems reasonable given the fact that this is one of many exchanges.\n\n**Edit4:** GOOG - 3,594,506 short volume; 1.27% of float; overshoots reported short interest a little (2.47 million). Is the method wrong or is the short interest misreported?",
