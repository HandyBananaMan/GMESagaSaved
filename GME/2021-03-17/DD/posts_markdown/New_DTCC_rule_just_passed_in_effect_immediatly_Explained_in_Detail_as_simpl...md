Edit: Typo in the title. It should be "immediately"

I. **The DTCC just published a "new" SEC Regulatory Rule Filing**

&#x200B;

II. The Subject of the filing is to (IN SHORT) "**Remove the Requirement for Participants to Submit Monthly Position Confirmations and Clarify Participant Obligation to Reconcile Activity on a Regular Basis**"

&#x200B;

III. This rule change has been on the table for some time and took effect today, because it was filed today. Thus I said it's "new".

&#x200B;

IV. **What effect does this rule have?** Especially in the current situation. In plain English: Hedgies had to report their positions on a monthly basis to the DTCC prior to the rule change.

In addition to that (by u/bull_moose_man)  there was a contradictory rule that stated daily reports had to be submitted; as Hedgies were able to cite this contradiction as a reason to ignore the rules, now that it’s gone they have no choice but to comply. That means submitting daily reports and opening up their accounts to the Govt if the balance “threatens” other NCSS members.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

V. **So what happens now?** Well, now that there is no rule stating when they have to report/confirm (previously once a month!), the DTCC can now ask them at any given time to report/confirm their positions. They are tying the rope around the snakes neck to keep them under control. This is nothing major, but wait for point VI. It already shows, DTCC is actually trying to stop these out of control Hedgefunds, because they are endangering other Institutions with their behaviour at the moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

VI. **Why this rule change is bigger than you think:** This rule in addition to the (yet to be passed) SR-NSCC-2021-801, stating that the DTCC can liquidate their members positions at any time, just shows, the DTCC wants to keep everything under their control. So if they see Citadel doing illegal shit (remember, they can ask for a report on a daily basis  now) and their new rule comes into effect, they would notice and could force Citadel to liquidate on close their positions. **This is the most important thing about this rule!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: New rule is in effect now. What does it do? Hedgies had to report their positions on a monthly basis to the DTCC. The subject of this rule change is "**Remove the Requirement for Participants to Submit Monthly Position Confirmations and Clarify Participant Obligation to Reconcile Activity on a Regular Basis**"

How is that any good?  Well, now that there is no rule stating when they have to report/confirm (previously once a month!), the DTCC can now ask them at any given time to report/confirm their positions. They are tying the rope around the snakes neck to keep them under control. This is nothing major, but wait for point VI. It already shows, DTCC is actually trying to stop these out of control Hedgefunds, because they are endangering other Institutions with their behaviour at the moment. (Also read point VI. Quote: "This rule in addition to the (yet to be passed) SR-NSCC-2021-801, stating that the DTCC can liquidate their members positions at any time, just shows, the DTCC wants to keep everything under their control. So if they see Citadel doing illegal shit (remember, they can ask for a report on a daily basis  now) and their new rule comes into effect, they would notice and could force Citadel to liquidate on close their positions.

Short DD, but I hope it helps. If there are any mistakes or I messed up something, call me out!

Very important remark by u/yosaso:

**Conclusion: The DTCC sounds like they're making sure to cover themselves because it's going to spill over!!!**
