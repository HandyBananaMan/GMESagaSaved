While browsing the comments on /u/heyitspixel's latest post regarding [the new DTCC rule being effective immediately](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m793h7/new_dtcc_rule_just_passed_in_effect_immediatly/?sort=top), I saw some fear and FUD around some of the verbiage in the document. I'd like to provide some clarity on the particular issue of DTC reducing their liability.

&nbsp;

> DTC shall not be liable for any loss resulting or arising directly or indirectly from mistakes, errors, or omissions related to the information, reports or statements provided by DTC, other than those caused directly by gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of DTC.

&nbsp;

I see many taking that as *"Oh no, that means they aren't going to pay up! They are protecting themselves!*" 

Please understand that **the DTCC generates and gives their report to its members** who are *then* required to validate and/or correct it based on their own records and activity. 

Therefore, this is **not a statement clearing DTCC of liability of its members** stupid actions (Citadel, et al.) but rather clearing DTCC of any liability on THEIR part by accidentally submitting incorrectly on the report that DTCC generates to issue to the members.

&nbsp;

**Why does this matter? It means that DTCC is still ultimately on the hook for payment to cover in the event that its members are insolvent.**

&nbsp;

For the less wrinkle-inclined apes Among Usâ„¢: DTCC can now, at any time, say *"Yo, Kenny G, it looks like you show that you are short just 200K shares of GME according to what you last reported. Can you confirm that, under threat that we will margin call your ass if we find out otherwise?"*

DTCC can now essentially audit its members at anytime, and they have to respond immediately via both phone-call and a written document. Prior to this change, they only had to report back once per month and they had 10 business days from the last Friday of the month to do so.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR**: New DTCC rule go ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸ¤šðŸ’Žâœ‹

If you got any value out of this post, [please check out this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6zzku/crucial_stimmie_info_a_critical_rundown_on_price/) that I've been trying to get eyes on. It is an important message for anyone planning to buy GME and it is great to know for trading in general.
