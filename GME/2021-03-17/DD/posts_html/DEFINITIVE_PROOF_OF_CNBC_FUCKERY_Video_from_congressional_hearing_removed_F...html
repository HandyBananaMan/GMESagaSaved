<p>If you wanted a definitive proof about who CNBC plays for, we got ya, retards. Thanks to eagle sight of u/Luxieto and help from u/HalinxHalo we got not one, but two pieces of evidence that CNBC doesn't shy from raw and pure manipulation.</p>
<p>Original video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imRzHXRq80I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imRzHXRq80I</a> - duration 04:37:06</p>
<p>CNBC video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM</a> - duration 04:17:58</p>
<p>We're missing about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>"Ahh, you crayon-eating poop-brain, they edited out all the cuts, breaks and stuff like that" I hear you saying. Yep! But also, CNBC fucks also did some extra shillwork on it.</p>
<p>At 02:38:19 (original video) - French Hill comes on and during his 5 minutes, he has doubts about separation of Citadel's businesses. <strong>In the CNBC version THERE IS NO FRENCH HILL. ERASED.</strong></p>
<p>At 02:45:59 (original video) - Cindy Axne comes on and during her 5 minutes asks about RH and Citadel's spreads, business practices. <strong>CNBC keeps about 5% of her time in their version of the video, EVERYTHING ELSE GETS CUT.</strong></p>
<p>You can go check it out yourselves, it's there for everybody to see.</p>
<p>We already knew they weren't clean, but tampering with a congressional hearing video? Is it just me or do you also smell desperation?</p>
<p>HODL monkey-brains, the end is near. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm a Euroape, so enlighten me somebody please - isn't media manipulation a crime in US?</p>
<p>EDIT2: Tweeted at Rep. Hill and Rep. Axne!</p>
