This is pure speculation to the point of shitposting, but after seeing how hard Ken just got left out to dry in the hearing I believe that this truly spited man is right now collecting liquid capital to start the squeeze himself. 

He knows citadel is out. He got shafted by the DTCC, and now the government has stated they're not worth saving. I think he's going to drop a bomb on the DTCC so hard and so fast that they'll take a serious hit.

Otherwise, why would our volume be SO LOW on a day when gamestop gets the most media attention it has received in months. They have stopped trading back and forth because they have accepted it's over. Why would the rest of the market be bleeding?

This is the tide pulling out before the tsunami. Ken has been left to the wolves, so he's going to make the DTCC bleed before he dies.

Just a shitposting prediction. But I think this is going to go nuts before the DTCC rules come into effect. They don't know HOW bad the citadel position is, so how can they prepare?
