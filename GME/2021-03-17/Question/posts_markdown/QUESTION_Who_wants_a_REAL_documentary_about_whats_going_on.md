I'm a filmmaker with a question.

Did the hearing today piss you off? Did the Hulu "documentary" piss you off? Does the condescension toward retail investors piss you off? WHY WASN'T COHEN MENTIONED IN THE HULU "doc"?

No one is focusing on the real issues or telling the real story and it's driving me insane.

We can change that.

Filmmaking is an arduous and expensive process so I want to gauge interest with all of you apes before I do the deep dive and make this shit happen:

So my questions are:

1. **Do you want to see a REAL documentary about the short squeeze of a lifetime and the battle against big money?** (upvote for a yes! Downvote for a no!)
2. **What** **key points should the film make?** (Drop it in the comments)

Cinema is the art form of the people for the people. The moving image has an unmatched power to captivate, move, and inspire. This community is rich in knowledge and resources and we shouldn't just stand by while the rich and powerful get to lie to the world about what's happening.

Fuck 'em.

I may post this a few more times at different hours of the day to make sure I'm not hitting a dead spot in the day! Not spam!

EDIT: COHEN

EDIT/UPDATE:

Damn y’all support is there. You all have some great ideas and have given me a ton to think about. There’s something really powerful about this thing coming from the community itself.

I’m gonna work on next steps and update y’all as soon as I’ve got ‘em!

Time for me to get my Guinness on. Happy St. Paddy’s!

\**^(To be clear, this is not an attempt to sway public opinion about the stock in any way or to manipulate/pump etc. This is a simple question by a filmmaker to gauge interest in the topic before losing sleep for months to make a film no one wants.)*
