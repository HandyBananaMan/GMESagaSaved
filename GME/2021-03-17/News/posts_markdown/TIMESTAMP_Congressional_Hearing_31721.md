[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=6530](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=6530)

[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=9175](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=9175)

***“Citadel controls as much trading volume as Nasdaq...”****; no concerns of systemic risk due to Citadel, if their MM function ceases tomorrow there is much competition from other MM will compete quickly to take over their market share; Citadel tried to become investment bank in 2008 and they have regulatory advantages over a bank, shifted to retail trading instead of becoming a bank, Griffin’s testimony raises concerns and should be investigated; MM’s highly competitive and removal of Citadel will have little impact;* ***there is risk on infrastructure side, risk on system institutional side, 26% of all us equities would stop, 8,900 listed securities would stop, they execute 47% of all retail volume,***  ***to say system would work fine if all that evaporated, you’re going to have a systemic event, to deny that is to deny reality****”*

[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=9499](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=9499)

Rep. Cindy Axne (IA-3)

[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=9793](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=9793)

*App design influencing decisions; Robinhood has behavioral researchers; 92% of RH users trades are outside S&P500, spreads are 5x as wide,  RH understood this and negotiated payment for order flow based on this, receive % of spread is misalignment of interest,* ***“fantastic in a negative way”****,*

[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=11654](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=11654)

Rep. David Kustoff (TN-8)

[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=12987](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=12987)

*Mr Tenev struggled to explain his mistakes, what failures or mistakes by RH did you observe?; failed to manage internal risk, not disclosed how they make money; best practices going forward, regulators need to investigate, institutional footprint, gaps in reporting in OTC; eliciting behaviors by their users and encouraging trading to the detriment of the trader.*

[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=14917](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=14917)

*Why we have markets…, “markets exist for us to be able to grow our commerce”, should provide environment for those activities, I was able to find that the short interest was at 150%; how can short selling inhibit raising equity for companies; short positions is now reported twice per month, provides lens into relative activity, need to go upstream, SEC should use Dodd-Frank to increase transparency; upstream disclosure needs to be addressed, and increased disclosure of short activity, expand firms that require disclosure.*

Rep. Van Taylor (TX-3)

[https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=16198](https://youtu.be/imRzHXRq80I?t=16198)
