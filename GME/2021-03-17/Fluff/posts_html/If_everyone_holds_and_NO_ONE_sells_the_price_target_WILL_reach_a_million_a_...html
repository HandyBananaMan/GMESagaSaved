<h1>Title: If everyone holds and NO ONE sells, the price target WILL reach a million a share. Do not paper hand this shit. All you have to do is sit on your shares. Thats it. Once it reaches a million you can punch your ticket. And thats the GameStop.</h1>

<p>It is that simple.</p>
<p>Share reaches 10k? Hold.</p>
<p>Share reaches 50k? Hold.</p>
<p>Share reaches 100k? Believe it or not hold.</p>
<p>Share reaches 500k? Directly to hold.</p>
<p>You just hold.</p>
<p>Then you can win the game, and hey maybe a bunch of other people can too.</p>
<p>One person makes a difference. You are that one person.</p>
<p>You hold.</p>
<p>1 million will be reached. </p>
<p>Backyard barbecues and beers for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Just.... Hold.</p>
<p>It can happen. It will happen.</p>
<p>Hold.</p>
<p>Also buy and hold.</p>
<p>Not financial advice.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>
