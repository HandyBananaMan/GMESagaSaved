# Title: If everyone holds and NO ONE sells, the price target WILL reach a million a share. Do not paper hand this shit. All you have to do is sit on your shares. Thats it. Once it reaches a million you can punch your ticket. And thats the GameStop.

It is that simple.

Share reaches 10k? Hold.

Share reaches 50k? Hold.

Share reaches 100k? Believe it or not hold.

Share reaches 500k? Directly to hold.

You just hold.

Then you can win the game, and hey maybe a bunch of other people can too.

One person makes a difference. You are that one person.

You hold.

1 million will be reached. 

Backyard barbecues and beers for the rest of your life.

Just.... Hold.

It can happen. It will happen.

Hold.

Also buy and hold.

Not financial advice.

Just my opinion.
