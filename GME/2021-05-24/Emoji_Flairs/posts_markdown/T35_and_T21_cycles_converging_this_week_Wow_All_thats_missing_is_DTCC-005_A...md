# Title: T+35 and T+21 cycles converging this week! Wow! All thatâ€™s missing is DTCC-005. Asking a super dumb question: in reverse logic, was DTCC-005 purposely missing this week in order to not detonate the house of cards this trading week?

Ape Andy is a dumb ape and asked: 
I heard that (May/24/2021)Monday is T+35 from Apr/16 options. 

And also T+21 cycles is Tue(May/25)or Wed(May/26). 

Pls smart apes, help verify?

deep ITM calls needed by SHF to reset FTD. 

Where is DTCC-005,which closes this loophole. 
Sigh~



Response: Thanks to smart apes @apespresso repost the DD :

T+35 and T+21 cycles converging this week.


All we are missing is DTCC-005. 


So asking another super dumb question:

In Reverse logic: 
Or was DTCC-005 purposely missing this week in order to not detonate the house of cards this trading week?
