When it happens, stop shilling completely as there's not reason at all to continue. And buy at least 1 GME if youâ€™re stupid enough not to be already holding anyway. Ask yourself "why would someone need to hire me to shill for them if the company really wasn't about to explode and take them down?" The answer is pretty obvious.

The same goes if they paid you to make shill bots. Deactiveate them all immediately when the squeeze starts, and hold with the rest of us. We'll respect you for taking some of their money presqueeze, if you flip sides immediately and completely. Ideally also exposing everything they said to you.

If you were a shill before and have since flipped to the light side, tell your story below!
