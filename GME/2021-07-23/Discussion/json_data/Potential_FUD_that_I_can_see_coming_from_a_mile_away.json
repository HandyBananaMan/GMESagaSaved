He has also been on our front page before talking about some of the issues we bring up. \nNow some of you might say \n\"He's one of us, see!\" \nAnd then when the price rises to 600-1000 and then immediately tanks he will come on TV and say \n\"Now that the short squeeze is over these businesses can function normally and hopefully legislators fix some of these issues.\" And some might paper hand here. \nSame goes with YouTubers, and people who post DD here, \nDon't put any of these people on a pedestal. \n\n\nIf you read the DD and believe it, the logical conclusion would be to hold until every last hedge fund that shorted GME goes out of business and your account looks like an international phone number, and then hold some more.",
