I been holding GME since early Feb, I believed many GME holder are holding since early Jan this year. Only few months left I will be a long term holder. if it still not squeezed by then,  you could lost over 100 billion on tax. Get the SEC to work. I love to pay 40 percent of tax and you using the tax money to make more Americans to live better live.
