<p>After more than 4 months of researching and DD.</p>
<p>We need a serious change.</p>
<p>The DTCC needs to disappear: No more private owned (by the elite and 1%) self regulated institution full of greed and corruption taking advantage of businesses and retail.</p>
<p>No more IOU’s: No more virtual assets or imaginary shares. Back to physical or completely transparent system, if you buy something you own something and can claim it anytime, no more middleman holding assets forever.</p>
<p>SEC needs a reform: Real reform and real power fully transparent and fair. No more going on favor of banks approving rules favoring them and giving exceptions to favor them. They need to be fair and partial to keep a healthy market and economy.</p>
<p>Blockchain system: a completely transparent, honest and fair system that favors all parties in a win-win-win scenario, honest with no massive gambling bets and simple. If the company grows then the owners or the company benefit, if the company is in trouble and is going bad so is the stock. </p>
<p>Wealth distribution: The money the DTCC (elite and big money) has been stealing and taking from businesses and retail for years needs to come back to the people they disrupt for so long, all the jobs, houses, struggles, technology lost and advancements everyone lost because of that elite greed and control needs to be paid.</p>
<p>It’s time, we need to wake up and make this world a better place. Enough is enough. </p>
<p>No financial advice, this is what needs to be done so we can recover as society and have a better world. Starting from the economy.</p>
<p>Edit: The saddest things about this whole situation is, we are being fucked by the middle man. This middle man are banks and big money that control and bought the government. </p>
<p>They are taking advantage of the transactions when all we want to do is support businesses and markets and at the same time benefiting for that support and help.</p>
