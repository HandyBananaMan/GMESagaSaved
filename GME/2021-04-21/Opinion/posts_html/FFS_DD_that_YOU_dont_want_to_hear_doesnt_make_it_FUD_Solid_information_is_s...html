<p>At the risk of being downvoted into shill oblivion,  I'm still going to put this out.  I'll forego all the attempts to build comradery via ape speak and self depreciating comments (although some would fit accordingly) and get to it.</p>
<p>I'm probably older than a lot of you on here, and have been around, doing some nutty shit in and out of the military special operations and subsequent private security world for several years.  (Been out of the game since having kids, but before that... lol, my risk assessment was all sorts of skewed, based on shit I did I volunteered to do at the time.)  Crap- I just said i was going to get right to it.  My bad.  So here:</p>
<p>"time-and-motion study", "going-over", "spot check", "examination"</p>
<p>These are other ways to say "due diligence".  When word came out that u/atobitt was putting out some DD that would make me shit myself, my first thought was "well that wasn't exactly a teaser expressing doubt... but nor did it express confidence." (like they often do when they are about to bear- or have knowledge of- good news.)  So my next immediate wonderment was "so by "shit myself"... does it mean I will squirt my skivvies because the DD will even more solidly cement in the reasons supporting an impending launch" or shit myself as in "well, shit.  I just yolo'd my shit down an inescapable drain of corruption."</p>
<p>Well, I'd say that- while I'm holding (and will continue to do so until I see hugely numbers)... this Pt 1 of this DD leans (IMO) toward the bad type of shit my pants.   Not the type that makes me lose all hope, but because of what it described. I saw a guy in the comments say "don't get your shit all twisted, this isn't anything new, and it's all been posted."  Another guy said it was a let down, b/c it was just a history lesson.</p>
<p>I disagree.  Now... I'm not getting so twisted about  the fact that my whole trading life is apparently an IOU.  What I took from this is that the DTC is, and has been- at best- negligent, allowing for manipulative short selling to take place w/o enforcing any common-sense rules, or- at worst- complicit in said manipulation via shorting and naked shorting.  I mean, MFers wrote in with specific concerns about their shares being shorted without their permission or even knowledge.  And... the DTC passed a fucking rule that said "no... not only will you not know who's shorting your shit w/o your permission... but ALSO no... you can't have your securities back."  What the actual fuggoli.</p>
<p>Crap.  Sorry, I rambled some more.  My point in writing this isn't to explain to you what my takeaway is. It's to say that, while I don't consider (at least this portion of the)DD to be great news.... it's still DD.  FFS, when I wondered out loud whether this was good news or bad, I was accused of "sewing (sic) FUD".  Can we all put on some big boy/girl pants and realize that we may not like everything we're going to see/hear on here... but that doesn't make it any less applicable regarding keeping me and all you faithful hourly-sub-refreshing MFers informed as to what the players are up to, even if it may not be in our favor.  Which, let's face it... just about none of their shenanigans are.</p>
<p>My hope here is two-fold.  Maybe, if atobitt can put all this shit together (mad props to him and all the DD gods, btw)... then others are also aware of A) how shit has been and B) how shit had better not go down this way.  I'm looking back at recent rule changes and trying to determine whether they will actually affect change regarding THIS DD... but so far, not much luck.  But WTF do I know... my eyes get glazed over when I'm trying to keep up with some of this DD, or I'm re-reading line by line I like a 2nd grader reading their first chapter book.</p>
<p>My other hope is that if no one else is hawkeyeing the hedgies and DTC as well as some of our people... then the DD that's coming out here will go viral from here, and will force SOMEone or another to look into shit, and start to question it.  This congressional hearings were a good start, but the inquiring parties- while they wanted to appear hard-ass and investigative- were not on the right paths (IMO). As much as the hedgies seemed to be sweating... I'll bet they were thanking God above that they were just being quizzed on paying for order flow, and not being required to explain how much they've been naked shorting or manipulating share prices by performing half a trade in a dark pool, and the other half on the exchange, or answering as to why if they have been fined so often for apparently blatantly breaking a rule.... they continue to do it.  Or so many other jacked up things.  To me, they got off as easy as they could have, and I hope that like at least one ape... folks are copying DD and sending it to their congressfolk (and any journalists that will listen), asking "WTF is this allowed?"...</p>
<p>OK, I'm done.  Back to the main point.  DD isn't just warm and fuzzy happy-ending fact lists.  It's everything in play.   Everything we're doing here is a gamble.  No matter how good or bad the odds... it's still a bet.  So why not take all the angles into consideration.  Am I changing my xxx position?  Nope.  Do I think you should? Fuck if I know, that's up to you.  But at least maybe refrain from shattering from the inside out and whining to  people who are doing great work that might- from time to time- reveal some shit you realize you'd rather not know.</p>
<p>Blah blah blah this ins't advice blah blah blah I'm stupid like ape blah blah.   But seriously....   Hold.</p>

<p>Edit: This is my first post on Reddit.  I wrote it here with like 31 karma b/c r/superstonk said go away until I had 200.  (I was all... WTF how can I get karma if i can't post here).  But you greased up, hype-for-millies MFers hooked me up here and I appreciate it.  especially the gold I got.  Thanks a bunch, kind ape.  I'll try to figure out how to pay it forward. </p>
