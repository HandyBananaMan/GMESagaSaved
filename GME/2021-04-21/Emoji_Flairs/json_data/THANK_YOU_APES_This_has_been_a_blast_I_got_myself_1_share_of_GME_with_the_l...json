    "selftext": "So I\u00b4m here to tell you all that this has been a wild ride, been here since early February, and was able to get myself 1 share of GME thinking that If this goes through, I could possibly pay my 15k bank debt and be able to start over fresh after I got divorced 4 months ago. I live in a country where we get paid $400 a month so you can imagine the struggle it was to get that 1 share lol.  \n\n\nAnyway, I\u00b4ve been holding even through the $40 dip, never sold, read all the DD and knew this was going forward. I wanna say THANK YOU APES, you are giving me a lot of hopes for a better life, or at least, a debt free one.  \n\n\nHODL! And I\u00b4ll see you all in the moon someday.",
