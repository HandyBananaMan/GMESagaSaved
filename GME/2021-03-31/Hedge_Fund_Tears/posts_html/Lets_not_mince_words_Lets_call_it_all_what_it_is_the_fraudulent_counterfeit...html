<h1>Title: Let's not mince words. Lets call it all what it is: the fraudulent counterfeiting of shares in order to drive an established business into bankruptcy. Wholeheartedly enabled abusive "market makers". These are criminal offences and they carry prison time.</h1>

<p>Calling them "naked" devalues the seriousness of the criminal offences committed.</p>
<p>I will be changing my language from one of the "speak" to calling it what it is. Fraudulently counterfeited shares and abuse of position to commit fraud on a grand scale. </p>
<p>These are criminal offences and should be talked about as such. </p>
<p>Using language like this gets rid of people having to research what the issue is. It states it in clear and concise english.</p>
<p>Let the roaches rot in prison for the destruction they've caused whilst the world was on its knees. </p>
<p>Fight for what's right by BUYING and HODlING.</p>

<p>Edit: a few people have pointed out that this is infact financial terrorism. I like this frame because it is exactly what it is, enabled by the fraudulent counterfeiting of shares by market makers.</p>
<p>u/rensole from now on can we do something about calling the hedgies financial terrorists or finter for short?</p>
<p>Edit 2: A wrinkly ape has stated not to shorten it as it weakens the message. Lets be clear; Financial Terrorists deserve gitmo.</p>
<p>Edit 3: 2008 SEC report on counterfeit shares and the damage they did. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiBzJiOp9vvAhXagf0HHdYTDacQFjAAegQIBBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1v5AsPY-lKSqVHfozkZyul</p>
