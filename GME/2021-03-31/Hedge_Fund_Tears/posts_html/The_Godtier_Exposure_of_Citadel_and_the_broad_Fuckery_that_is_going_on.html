<p>My fellow ape brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>we have an ape among us that really fucking blew my mind several times already in the past 2 months. He put some heavy Detective Conan action research in his DD and in my opinion these are defo one of the most important DDs we have as resource.</p>
<p>I‘m talking about u/atobitt. If you haven’t read any of his DDs yet I highly encourage you to do so. </p>
<p>They show how fucked everything in reality is.</p>
<p>The Masterpieces:</p>

<p>These DDs are of immeasurable value for us. Especially because we’re probably only scratching on the surface of the fuckery that is going on.</p>
<p>There was a post yesterday with extremely cryptic content of an OP with a possible link to Kenny G. Creating connections to Bernie M. and the UT as well as payments to the SEC. </p>
<p>At this point nothing is random and a coincidence. </p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Read the fucking DDs of this elite ape u/atobitt and fucking HODL. It’s going to be a crazy ride to Pluto. Kenny G, Citadel and the DTCC will pay for the fuel 🚀🚀🚀</p>
