He put some heavy Detective Conan action research in his DD and in my opinion these are defo one of the most important DDs we have as resource.\n\nI\u2018m talking about u/atobitt. If you haven\u2019t read any of his DDs yet I highly encourage you to do so. \n\nThey show how fucked everything in reality is.\n\nThe Masterpieces:\n\n[Citadel has no Clothes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[Blackrock Bagholders](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7o7iy/blackrock_bagholders_inc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[The Everything Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nThese DDs are of immeasurable value for us. Especially because we\u2019re probably only scratching on the surface of the fuckery that is going on.\n\nThere was a post yesterday with extremely cryptic content of an OP with a possible link to Kenny G. Creating connections to Bernie M. and the UT as well as payments to the SEC. \n\nAt this point nothing is random and a coincidence. \n\nTL;DR\n\nRead the fucking DDs of this elite ape u/atobitt and fucking HODL. It\u2019s going to be a crazy ride to Pluto. Kenny G, Citadel and the DTCC will pay for the fuel \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
