Calling them "naked" devalues the seriousness of the criminal offences committed.

I will be changing my language from one of the "speak" to calling it what it is. Fraudulently counterfeited shares and abuse of position to commit fraud on a grand scale. 

These are criminal offences and should be talked about as such. 

Using language like this gets rid of people having to research what the issue is. It states it in clear and concise english.

Let the roaches rot in prison for the destruction they've caused whilst the world was on its knees. 

Fight for what's right by BUYING and HODlING.

Edit: a few people have pointed out that this is infact financial terrorism. I like this frame because it is exactly what it is, enabled by the fraudulent counterfeiting of shares by market makers.

u/rensole from now on can we do something about calling the hedgies financial terrorists or finter for short?

Edit 2: A wrinkly ape has stated not to shorten it as it weakens the message. Lets be clear; Financial Terrorists deserve gitmo.

Edit 3: 2008 SEC report on counterfeit shares and the damage they did. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiBzJiOp9vvAhXagf0HHdYTDacQFjAAegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw1v5AsPY-lKSqVHfozkZyul
