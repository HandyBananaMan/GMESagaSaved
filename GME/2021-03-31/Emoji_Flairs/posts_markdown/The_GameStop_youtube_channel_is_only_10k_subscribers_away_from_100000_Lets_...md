Edit: yes, we also need to follow their subreddit, Facebook, twitter, app, etc. Not only do we own this, but it provides us with delicious dd and deals ðŸ¤¤.

Edit2: They have a twitch channel as well!  https://www.twitch.tv/gamestop 

Update: it is almost 93k now! I will wake up later and see it at 95k most likely. I predict a fully active channel with esports by the end of the year, with a sweetass 10M ðŸ’Ž play button. Cheers everyone, thank you!
