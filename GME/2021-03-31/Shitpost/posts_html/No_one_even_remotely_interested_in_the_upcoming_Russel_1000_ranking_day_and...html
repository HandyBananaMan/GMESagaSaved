<p>I seriously just might start shitposting my DD at this point since no one gives this stuff any attention.</p>
<p>No one looking far enough into the future to realize that on the 7'th of MAY the IWF (Russel 1000) index is going to rank US companies and in June (Same month as GME earnings) they're probably going to add GME to the Russel 1000?</p>
<p>Made a proper DD about this a while ago but it plopped. I guess it'll be relevant and popular in a month's time from now !remindme 1month</p>
<p>FYI, GME is not part of the S&amp;P500 like a lot of you apes just think. It's part of the Russel 2000. GME joining the Russel 1000 is a pretty decent event... I can't believe no one's giving this ANY attention.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Adding my previous DD about this here since this shitpost got so much attention...</p>
