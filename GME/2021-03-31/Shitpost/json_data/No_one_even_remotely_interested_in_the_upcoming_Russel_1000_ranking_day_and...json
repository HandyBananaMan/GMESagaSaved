I guess it'll be relevant and popular in a month's time from now !remindme 1month\n\nFYI, GME is not part of the S&P500 like a lot of you apes just think. It's part of the Russel 2000. GME joining the Russel 1000 is a pretty decent event... I can't believe no one's giving this ANY attention.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcrfpacmjdq61.png?width=1923&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2c93bcd8fe53e015f6936a20d1016df8c17aaeb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2rt5tenjdq61.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=63cdd14433b568687f5696f77fb38e72115213d5\n\n**EDIT:** Adding my previous DD about this here since this shitpost got so much attention...\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdau40/gme\\_possibly\\_moving\\_from\\_russel\\_2000\\_to\\_russel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdau40/gme_possibly_moving_from_russel_2000_to_russel/)",
