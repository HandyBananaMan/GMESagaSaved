BETA is -36.00 on Bloomberg terminal for GME 

if that doesn’t speak volumes that this stock is heavily shorted and manipulated apr Andy don’t know what does!

if the market crashes GME is basically a winning lottery ticket, 

if hedges keep bleeding they have to cover eventually. 

The outcome is inevitably the same either way, this is why apes hold!

it’s just a waiting game!
