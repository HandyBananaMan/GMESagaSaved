<p>BETA is -36.00 on Bloomberg terminal for GME </p>
<p>if that doesn’t speak volumes that this stock is heavily shorted and manipulated apr Andy don’t know what does!</p>
<p>if the market crashes GME is basically a winning lottery ticket, </p>
<p>if hedges keep bleeding they have to cover eventually. </p>
<p>The outcome is inevitably the same either way, this is why apes hold!</p>
<p>it’s just a waiting game!</p>
