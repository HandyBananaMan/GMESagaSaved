<p>Edit 1: Could actually be 418 million just today but I’m not too sure as the graph is abit confusing but regardless, 110 million is still high as fuk</p>
<p>Edit 2: So apparently it was 110 million at the last minute. Honestly I just come across this bunning my zoot so apologies. This is why I posted it for you lovely apes to comment and discuss</p>
<p>Edit 3: I was in monthly view when talking about oct 08 being 83 million. This chart is very confusing</p>
<p>Edit 4: Apparently yahoo finance messes up the DJI historical data. The numbers are actually supposed to be “normal”. If you look at investing.com it also seems normal so I dunno wtf is up with yahoo. Thanks for all the info and my first awards 😬</p>
<p>Edit 5: There was a huge selloff anyway at the last minute worth 3.4 trillion usd. Dunno if this means anything but seems unusual</p>
