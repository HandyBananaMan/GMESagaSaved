<p>This is going to be quite a long arse post. Most of what I am going to say is going to sound slightly negative. I myself am all in on GME. At the current price point I have almost doubled my money. Am I selling? No. Do I believe in the squeeze as much as ever? Yes. But in every war you learn to hear both sides. It is only healthy to fully understand what's going on so you can better plan your moves.</p>
<p>None of this is financial advice. This is just one apes interpretation and understanding of what is going on. Do your own DD. Buy or sell without listening to others. But in a hypothetical world if a squeeze was to happen for XX stock this is what I would advise.</p>
<p>TLDR; Buy and Hold <strong>SHARES</strong>. contact your representatives. The SEC, etc. you may think what can 1 person do. but ape together strong. It's easy to ignore 1 or even 10 people. But hundreds, thousands, constantly? No.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Before I start let me say this again. The last time I said this I got downvoted to hell and called shill. But I shall reiterate. Kenny G and Co. are smarter than most of us. Hell they are probably more conniving than most of the world in all aspects. This is even more so the case when it comes to the financial markets. This is their domain. Know your enemy. You can hate them, not respect them, but until the war is done and won, acknowledge their abilities at playing this game. regardless of what illegal means are being employed. Only in that way can apes together think level headedly and fight smartly.</p>
<p>**If they are so smart how did they end up in this situation?**It happens to the smartest of people. But in my opinion how did January happen? Lack of respect for the abilities of apes. As simple as that. Even as things got progressively worse for them towards the end of 2020, they still could never fathom the retardation of apes, they still thought they could crush apes. Why? The question should by why wouldn't they? They were bringing in record profits even during the pandemic by doing what they always did. Life was easy. They were on autopilot mode. They had previously brought corporations to their knees. Crushed them to the ground and made huge profits. If they could do that to large corporations with 100s of millions to fight against them, why in the world would they even consider apes a threat? Long story short they got caught with their pants down when apes went into frenzy in Jan and this being a new phenomenon, they did not have any contingency plan in place. Everything was done of the fly and they couldn't scramble together to stem the tide.</p>
<p>**How is this different now?**Now they have a game plan. There has been more than enough time for them to come up with something. You best believe if they can't do it they would have hired and gotten help from the best in the world to come up with something. They also could have bribed people. They could have blackmailed some sod in the SEC with incriminating photos. They could threaten someone's kid's education, etc. They have their tentacles all the way up the highest levels of the system. These aren't conspiracy theories.. <strong>Hundreds of Billions are at stake</strong>. You could murder someone in the U.S. for less than a few 100k. You best believe there is some high level fkery on going behind the scenes. These are titans of the industry, you best believe they are doing everything to stay on top. <strong>But don't forget most uprisings and revolutions are brought about by the people having enough of it. Even the biggest dynasties can crumble to the might of the people.</strong> At the end of the day, these are all speculations and just some of the myriad of tactics they might use. I'm here to talk about the things I can say to a high degree of certainty about the tactics they are employing with options and why we should not touch them with a 10 foot pole.</p>
<p><strong>Citadel LLC</strong>I keep seeing posts talking about Citadel as if they are only a hedge fund. Fck me. if that is all they were, this would have been long over.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC</a></p>
<p>"<strong>Citadel LLC</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Citadel Investment Group, LLC</strong>) is an American multinational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund">hedge fund</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services">financial services</a> company. Founded in 1990 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin">Kenneth Griffin</a>, the company operates two primary businesses: Citadel, one of the world's largest alternative asset managers with more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$">US$</a>35 billion in assets under management (as of October 1, 2020);<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC#cite_note-3">[3]</a> and <strong>Citadel Securities, one of the leading</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker"><strong>market makers</strong></a> <strong>in the world, whose trading products include</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock"><strong>equities</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)"><strong>equity options</strong></a><strong>, and interest rate swaps for retail and institutional clients."</strong></p>
<p>They are one of the biggest market makers in the world. This is the fking issue. What are market makers you ask? the description itself explains it. Simple apes always be speaking as if Citadel is just a Hedge fund and they may be colluding with market makers to do all their option shenanigans and why would market makers want to risk doing that.The thing is <strong>THEY DONT HAVE TO.</strong> FFS they are both the hedge fund and the market maker. How fked up is that? This is the type of beast that we are up against. This is Hidden dungeon final boss levels of magnitude (<strong>which is why once defeated, the loot will be legendary</strong>). But by no means is this going to be an easy process</p>
<p>"Citadel Securities is the largest market maker in options in the U.S., executing about 25 percent of U.S.-listed equity options volume.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC#cite_note-53">[53]</a> According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, about one-third of stock orders from individual investors is completed through Citadel, which accounts for about 10% of the firm's revenue"</p>
<p>Ok now to my main point about options. It annoys me to the max when others post "DD" on the options chain, option positions, their opinions on what happens if we end at xx amt. Half of these apes don't understand the basics of how delta hedging works. The worst misconception that people keep having is that Friday is always exciting. it isn't. Its the most boring day. Don't take my word. open up your chart. Look at <strong>EVERY SINGLE FRIDAY</strong> since January. Find me a single Friday in which we have had big positive movements? In fact the opposite is more true. We often trade sideways if not downwards on a Friday. The big movements usually occur midweek. Market makers aren't "hedging" everything at one go as the prices hit certain levels on a Friday. That doesn't even make sense.. that isn't even hedging anymore lol. If people want more explanations on how this works I am happy to go into further detail but for now I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>**So why are options bad?**Options aren't bad. I love options. This is a casino. with other stocks its a fun roller coaster.<strong>But for GME it fkin hell sure is bad.</strong> As show above. who writes your options? Who has all your option positions? all the DD fellow apes here post on options, lacks something. The overall picture of <strong>WHO OWNS WHAT OPTIONS AT WHAT EXACT STRIKES.</strong> people keep hypothesizing that we are perhaps bein helped by friendly whales so that we are causing them max pain.. but from the start I have said that they are the ones that may be the ones causing us max pain. let me explain how and the context behind why I believe so based on these premises:</p>
<ol>
<li>They have maphack. They can basically see everyone's positions. They know where their friendlies stand, where their enemies stand.</li>
<li>They have the ability to do naked shorting and they still have some funds in their war chest left</li>
<li>Apes have limited funds in our war chest left to create big price movements (I for one am such a person, already all in)</li>
<li>Their ability to manipulate price in their favor, dollar to dollar is greater than an apes through manipulation of the system and use of algorithms to game the system (by this I mean if ape spend 100k on stock maybe price go up 3 dollars. If hedgie spend 100k might be able to drop the price by 10 dollars)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why Fridays almost never go in our favor. Even if we try to put a positive spin on things when we end at certain price, to be honest we never know if this is the exact price they wanted it to end at. <strong>EVEN IF THE PRICE GOES UP A DECENT AMOUNT IT MAY ALSO BE WHAT THEY WANT</strong>. Let me explain why this is so.</p>
<p>- lets say Hedgie has 500millions in losses because he shorted GME at 50 dollars and the price is now 100 dollars</p>
<p>- Hedgie has everyone's options positions. So he looks at where all the enemies calls are positioned. lets say there is a fk tonne of ape calls at 150strike.</p>
<p>- Hedgie says ok lets buy a lot of 130strike call options</p>
<p>- Hedgie doesn't spend the week heavily shorting GME. He just controls the price movements and shorts it when needed to make sure momentum doesn't get out of hand and saves all his gunpowder for friday. Lets the price slowly climb through the week from 100 to around 145</p>
<p>- Apes are happy cause price is going up, thinks we are winning. TO THE MOON. buy more options cause stock seems bullish. Wont sell options for profit because DIAMOND HANDOS</p>
<p>- Hedgies know this. the movement is about DIAMOND HANDS (<strong>which is even worse when it comes to options because then they might not even delta hedge your options because they know they are going to drive the price below that and you aren't going to sell your options for profit beforehand because diamond handsss - I'm not saying dont diamond hands. but fk if you do that for options they are going to use it against you. do it with SHARES SHARES SHARES. NOT OPTIONS. DONT PLAY OPTIONS)</strong></p>
<p>- So come friday. Hedgies drive the price to end at 140 or 141 or 142. Their short position has risen to 900million in loses from the 40 dollar increase in price. <strong>BUT THEY EAT ALL THE MONEY FROM THE 150 AND ABOVE STRIKE PRICE OPTIONS PLUS THEY MAKE BANK FROM THEIR OWN 130STRIKE OPTIONS.</strong> As long as these amounts &gt; then the 400mil extra the suffered from the increase in price which is definitely the case, <strong>Their margin position gets better and better if they rinse and repeat this week after week.</strong> <strong>which is why they probably still have not gotten margin called. They are more likely the ones causing us MAX PAIN than the other way round.</strong></p>
<p>The vice versa is true if they choose to buy put options instead of call options.</p>
<p>This is my hypothesis of why the price fluctuates between the 100-300 dollar range. they are fucking with apes who are buying options and stealing their money, all the while giving them a better and better margin difference each week from the profits.</p>
<p>I myself have had options which were up 300%. I have diamond handed that shit to hell and it expired worthless. Lucky most of my holdings in GME were actual shares.</p>
<p>**So what advice do I have to counter this for fellow apes? (this is not financial advice)**If you are currently holding options... <strong>SELL THEM and BUY SHARES.</strong> you are simply being played with options. you may end up winning a little here and there but as a whole, you just got lucky because you were not at a position where the HF wanted to drive the price to. Because not enough apes and friendlies were at that strike price to matter to them. But options are already risky enough as it is. Add in HF fukery and its not worth it at all anymore. CITADEL IS THE ONE SELLING YOU THE OPTIONS. you think they sell it to you knowing they gonna lose it? Also options on GME are so fking expensive. I burned like 10 - 20k on them in the earlier days because I diamond handed that shit when I could've just bought more shares and diamond handed that shit instead and have no worries.</p>
<p>I have said this in other posts, but only as comments. <strong>RIGHT NOW THEY ARE IN CONTROL OF THE PRICE. WE HAVE LITTLE SAY IN IT UNLESS THERE IS SOME BIG CATALYST. OR UNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS AND A FEW DAYS BEFORE THAT. BUT THE PRICE DOES NOT MATTER. YOU COUNTER EVERYTHING THEY TRY AND PULL IF YOU SIMPLY BUY AND HOLD. I REPEAT BUY AND HOLD. BUY AND HOLD. DONT DO ANYTHING ELSE. DONT BUY ANYTHING ELSE. BUY SHARES AND HOLD. THAT COUNTERS ALL FKERY THEY CAN TRY AND PULL. STOP FEEDING THEM WITH OPTION PREMIUMS</strong></p>
<p>If no one bought options in a perfect scenario, THEY WOULDNT HAVE MAX PAIN IDEAL PRICES TO DRIVE THE STOCK TOWARDS. THEY CANT SHORT IT INDEFININITELY CAUSE THEN APE SEE BARGAIN AND BUY. THEY WOULD BECOME HEADLESS CHICKENS NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. ONLY WAY OUT THEN FOR THEM IS TO GO LONG ON THE STOCK ALSO TO COVER LOSSES AND FK OVER OTHER SHORTS. THEN IT WOULD BE SHORTS VS SHORTS SEEING who bails on the other first.</p>
<p>At the end of the day they still have that lump sum short position that they haven't cleared. They still have to buy this back from us eventually. Squeeze is not Squoze. But helping them with their margin sure isn't making this process any faster and you are doing more harm then good playing options unless you yourself are a whale with the power to influence price.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>: Forgot to include this part. Not saying this is actually happening.. but can you also imagine <strong>if</strong> there were friendly whales who are trying to help themselves and help us. If they knew that this week hedgies have chosen to go long.(they probably have more data than us and insider info) But we apes hear other apes saying we need to reach $200 this week! its already at 195! there are xxx number of calls that would be ITM if it hits $200! Now imagine if most of those calls were from the hedgies. Friendly whales try their best to keep the price below that to bleed them out for that Friday. Then manic apes throwing their last few dollars genuinely thinking it would help to get the price over $200. Friendly whales at their desks be like FML whut these apes doin?! Then price ends at $201 and apes celebrate while friendly whales banging their heads on their tables.In conclusion, we don't have all the info. We never know. We don't know all the little pieces of the puzzle. The best is we can do is hypothesize. Even if we find info online, how do we know how reliable the data is? It could be a trojan horse for all we know. So rather than be a nuisance, just buy and hold normally, we know for a fact that can only be good thing. but don't set price targets, especially based on option activity. and yes again. don't play options.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: **Many people are asking but if I scalp options and make more money to buy more GME then what's the harm?**its the exact same logic as people who day trade GME. Again I will re-iterate. It is not my place to tell you what to do with your monies. This is not advice. But if you wouldn't day trade GME then you shouldn't do the same with options. If everyone do the same then when liftoff? But in terms of the technical aspect on how it benefits hedgies and negatively affects apes, there are too many variables involved to give you guys a definite answer because by playing options you give hedgies many options (no pun intended) to handle the situation. but the more options are bought, the more info and markers you give them to work with. the more ways they can fk you or apes together as a whole. I do not know their exact liquidity, I do not know their maintenance margin at the moment. But this would be my best hypothesis on how they are handling the situation if you buy:</p>
<p><strong>Deep ITM options</strong> : they delta hedge this accordingly and just make money off the spread like any MM would</p>
<p><strong>ITM options</strong> : depending on what is their plan for the week. They could handle it the same way they handle Deep ITM options or if they know they are driving the price down by expiry, they don't even delta hedge these as they know they will expire worthless.</p>
<p><strong>OTM options</strong> : Again same logic as ITM options. totally depends on their play for the week</p>
<p><strong>Deep OTM options</strong> : They probably dont give a fk about you. The fact that you have bought deep OTM options is likely that you aren't going to scalp these for tiny profits until the squeeze</p>
<p>Think about it this way. their short positions that they got buttfked with are <strong>sunk cost</strong>. what they are doing each and every week is just to ensure that for that specific week they end up positive.</p>
<p>The only way I can possibly think of to fk them is to prematurely exercise your ITM options. But as much as retarded apes like to say, lets be real. how many people actually even have the cash to exercise their options. I dont expect anyone to also. They know you are planning to sell your options. so when you sell your options some other schmuck buys them. As long as before that option expires they drive the price down to make them worthless, then why bother to delta hedge?</p>
<p>So how do we stop this from happening? don't buy options. lol. same answer.</p>
<p>and with the people who are talking about covered calls and different strategies and spreads. chillax I am not referring to you guys. doing all that is fine and dandy. My post is intended for people who are playing options nakedly or for people who genuinely think buying options for GME are safe and fair or are helping with the gamma squeeze just because so many simple apes have been hollering gamma squeeze gamma squeeze like its the first words they have learned. IMO the gamma squeeze is extremely unlikely given the fact that MM sees all. MM is the fkin eye of sauron. How can they possibly be caught in a gamma squeeze when they see all the positions...?</p>
<p>The amount of simple apes out there astounds me. when I first released this post, the first 2 comments were innocent simple apes telling me that I am the minority. others have done trusted DD to show that a gamma squeeze <strong>"IS NEEDED"</strong> for the SS... and i'm sitting here like.. wtf?</p>
<p>So I shall end this edit again with... Buy and Hold. that way you suffer nothing. because to be honest, this stock is not mooning if there isnt a reason to. I dont want to be negative nancy but I am saying at this point in time it might be a stalemate for a little while. But we still hold all the cards. We cant lose if we just hold. They still bleed daily (again unless youre feeding them options plays)</p>
<p>There has to be a catalyst. or an action from a big whale, like in the Shkreli squeeze. We don't know when that is. but so what? we hold shares. we can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent. when this moons we might all be millionaires. you cannot wait till then? Honestly. they cannot drive the price below a 100. or even close to 100. at those prices we would just gobble them back up.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I see some people asking about the deep OTM optionswhen I say they don't give give a fk about the deep OTM options, I mean those that ape buy, not those that currently exist, which they probably own. Again these are only my opinions but here goes.</p>
<p>1st possibility: Hedgie has certain amt of maintenance margin right? Pass a certain point they get margin called right? So how do they show their broker/regulators that they are sufficiently covered? they buy a lot of deep OTM options. Remember when they bought these they were relatively cheap. We don't know their exact short positions so there's no way to determine what is the critical price GME has to hit before shit hits the fan...but as price increases, they lose more and more money on their shorts, but their 800 calls start gaining more and more value. One goes down one goes up. This helps them maintain their maintenance margin without getting margin called that quickly in event of upward price movements as one helps mitigate the other albeit unevenly. Again we dont know the breaking point at which the losses from the shorts outweigh the gains from their calls enough so that they get margin called because we dont know the exact positions... but yea just my 2 cents worth. but we definitely know it has to be over 350 since they were ok with the price reaching that level before shutting it down.</p>
<p>2nd possibility:  Also owned by hedgies. Used as a red herring. A trojan horse of sorts. They knew apes would suss out the big 800 call volume. remember the march 19th hype? but think about it. simply because of spending a few million on this distraction, how many simple ape jump into buying calls for march 19 that expired worthless all the way up to 800 ? these were all premiums they gobbled up for free. FFS they might have been the ones themselves to leak the info that "oh checkout all these weird large call options at 800! some big money must know something we don't!" Then ape go me want banana too me buy many deep OTM options. then many ape die.</p>
<p>The point is they dont want / dont expect these calls to ever make money. they are there for show more than anything. ideally they still want the stock to crash and burn.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> To all the people screaming but in January gamma squeezed happened. How dare you invalidate the theory of the gamma squeeze! Explain January!! I did. You just didn't read. What happened in January happened within a few days. Many apes with banks full of money poured into GME with call options and shares in a short span of time. This was worldwide news. That kind of unexpected influx caught them with their pants down. Now compare that period of time vs now. Where is your sudden influx of volume going to come from? Is this the same situation? No one is claiming gamma squeezes don't exist. It just does not apply as much anymore in this current situation. Do you think because you just learned what gamma squeezes mean that its a common occurrence and an everyday thing? But feel free to have your own opinion.<br />
Also people say why not just use a broker that doesn't route through Citadel. Eh.. do you think most MM/brokers dont sell data or share it? payment for order flow isn't a new thing. It has just been brought to light because of what happened with Robin hood. Even facebook sells your data. you think any MM/broker don't engage in this? It's free money for them. is your broker a non-profit? I use IBKR and even they admit they do payment for order flow, just that its a much smaller % of their overall revenue, which means nothing at all. Just means they have other revenue incomes. But long story short, they all do it.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I know I said I would continue this post with the Shkreli squeeze but it would be weird if I did a post on the loan fee rate, loanable shares and its relation to the squeeze in this post itself so I will do it on another post possibly tomorrow. But have a read on it first if you haven't. I know others have talked about this before. But it seems like people keep talking more about the VolksW squeeze in comparison to GME. I find that the Shkreli squeeze has way more similarities. Also MM (such as citadel) could be hiding the actual data and releasing whatever info they want to the public - as we know, the fines are negligibly small <img alt="https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/" src="https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/" />but TLDR maybe.. just maybe whale intentionally loaning out shares and waiting for right time to recall them. letting more shorters short themselves into oblivion so liftoff has that much more squeeze power.</p>
