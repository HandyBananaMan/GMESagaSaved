Sounds like good news tbh\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI\n\nEdit 1: Could actually be 418 million just today but I\u2019m not too sure as the graph is abit confusing but regardless, 110 million is still high as fuk\n\nEdit 2: So apparently it was 110 million at the last minute. Honestly I just come across this bunning my zoot so apologies. This is why I posted it for you lovely apes to comment and discuss\n\nEdit 3: I was in monthly view when talking about oct 08 being 83 million. This chart is very confusing\n\nEdit 4: Apparently yahoo finance messes up the DJI historical data. The numbers are actually supposed to be \u201cnormal\u201d. If you look at investing.com it also seems normal so I dunno wtf is up with yahoo. Thanks for all the info and my first awards \ud83d\ude2c\n\nEdit 5: There was a huge selloff anyway at the last minute worth 3.4 trillion usd. Dunno if this means anything but seems unusual",
