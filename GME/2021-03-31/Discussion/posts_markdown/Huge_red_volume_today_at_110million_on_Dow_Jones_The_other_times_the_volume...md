If a smarter ape can elaborate would be great. Sounds like good news tbh

Edit 1: Could actually be 418 million just today but I‚Äôm not too sure as the graph is abit confusing but regardless, 110 million is still high as fuk

Edit 2: So apparently it was 110 million at the last minute. Honestly I just come across this bunning my zoot so apologies. This is why I posted it for you lovely apes to comment and discuss

Edit 3: I was in monthly view when talking about oct 08 being 83 million. This chart is very confusing

Edit 4: Apparently yahoo finance messes up the DJI historical data. The numbers are actually supposed to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. If you look at investing.com it also seems normal so I dunno wtf is up with yahoo. Thanks for all the info and my first awards üò¨

Edit 5: There was a huge selloff anyway at the last minute worth 3.4 trillion usd. Dunno if this means anything but seems unusual
