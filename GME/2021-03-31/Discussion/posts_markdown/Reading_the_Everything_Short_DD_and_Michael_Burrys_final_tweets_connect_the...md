Update: Burry's Twitter now links to [this.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm) ... he knows we are looking ðŸ‘€ *it directly refers to the rehypothecization and treasury securities discussed in Everything Short DD*

Everyone in this sub talks about the movie the Big Short every single day. I see it quoted constantly. Well did you know that the guy that movie is based on, Dr. Burry, [has been screaming at us for a while](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-warns-stock-market-huge-risk-crashing-2021-2-1030106969) about an impending crash, and it came to a head in the last few days? He called it once in 2008, and now he's been silenced on Twitter again by the SEC. The only way he can speak to us now is [cryptically](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mh3sar/michael_burrys_new_twitter_profile_and_background/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), just like DFV. 

To a person with @uti$m, words mean something. Every word does. Every symbol.... every unwritten, suggestive wink or nudge. We're really good at giving clues and seeing deeper meaning (I say we because I have a$perg's). We notice patterns and algorithms that normal people don't. And cryptic language is often our bread and butter. Yes, DFV, MJBurry, even Papa Cohen are communicating with apes the only way they can... through cryptic means. And their messages are important. Remember... every word means something to an @uti$t.

If you read the Everything Short DD and you're freaked out, it's ok. If you think u/atobitt is a shill or sent to induce FUD, I believe you're wrong. And here's why. 

Everything in the DD echoes what our boy Dr. Burry has been saying since at least [Sept 2019.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html) One confirms the other. What more [confirmation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mh7a8k/im_just_gonna_leave_this_right_here/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) do you need? 

Also look at what DJI and NASDAQ have been up to in AH. I believe we are approaching the launchpad ladies and apes ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Disclaimer: I'm fucking hella blazed 24/7 and I wrote this while I was still choking on dabs and crayons. I'm just purging words into the ethos of GME. Love you crazy apes ðŸ’–

2nd disclaimer: I'm actually a person with @$pergers, and not using the term @uti$m in a derogatory way. Automod trippin.

Dr. Burry, if you're reading this don't worry. CFH are HODLing;


Under the lights where we stand tall

Nobody touches us at all

Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without

We're gonna take what's ours to have

Spread the word throughout the land

They say bad guys wear black

We're tagged and can't turn back


You see us comin'

And you all together run for cover

We're taking over this town


Here we come reach for your g*n

And you better listen well, my friend, you see

It's been slowed down below

Aimed at you, we're the cowboys from hell

Deed is done again, we've won

Ain't talking no tall tales friend

'Cause high noon, your doom

Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell
