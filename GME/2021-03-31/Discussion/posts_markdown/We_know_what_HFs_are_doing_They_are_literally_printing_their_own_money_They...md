#Title: We know what HF's are doing. They are literally printing their own money. They can call it shorts, synthetic shares, FTD's... Its robbing the company who issues shares. Im sure it plays a big part in inflation. Why cant we call that stealing? When can we start calling HF's what they are. Thieves!

It blows my mind. That the corruption is so blatant. Yet ignored by our government.
If someone steals food from a store to feed their family. They get arrested, labeled a thief, and may even spend a little time in jail.  But if they stole or counterfeited billions not a problem.
