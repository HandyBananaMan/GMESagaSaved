    "selftext": "Hello ape gang, grab your crayons and let\u2019s head out for some whale watching.  Friendly reminder: life\u2019s too short for cheap crayons- treat yo self to some Crayola, because [fuck RoseArt, your crayons taste like the salty tears of unloved children.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/donnad/scientific-proof-that-rose-art-crayons-suck)  Ahem.\n\nNow, if you haven\u2019t read any DD how Melvin and Citadel are using options for fuckery, please PLEASE read  posts  by u/Cuttingwater_ who  does  a  great  job  of  explaining  [Conversions, and how buying options could be helping Melvin and Citadel.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4cite/buying_calls_could_actually_be_helping_the_shorts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)   (Edit: a  far  smarter  ape  than  I,  u/WardenElite saw  the  same  thing  today  [In his daily post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mh62v6/live_charting_for_3312021_predicting_the_days/)  He  has  a  BIG  ol\u2019  wrinkly  brain,  and  explains  this  much  better  than  I  can.)  Yesterday,  new  DD  emerged  suggesting  that  [All of these contracts are being sold naked,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgq7am/dd_reposting_for_visibility_the_naked_shorting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and  is  the  key  to  how  hedgies  are  hiding  their  short  interest.  Options  =  window  into  Citadel/Melvin  fuckery.\n\nSO today, a bunch of DEEP in-the-money call contracts were posted at the end of the trading day.  These are the active option strikes for call and put contracts available for traders, yesterday, vs. today: (apes can go see this themselves at [https://www.optionsonar.com/unusual-option-activity/gme](https://www.optionsonar.com/unusual-option-activity/gme) )\n\n[3\\/30\\/21](https://preview.redd.it/i58ctfckmfq61.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b36c140d1abcd4acea6809eb845983de7641026)\n\n[Well lookie there](https://preview.redd.it/a822ip11nfq61.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a652f4c5f67b11e8160e151c4dd776e4132d2df6)\n\nLast time I posted about noticing these deep-ITM posts (3/17 was the day they were active, gone by the next morning), the banana heavens smiled down on me and an ape left a comment from [The greatest unicorn of all, Alexis Goldstein.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7xipv/whale_watching_the_sweeping_seas_318/grgn43k?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  This is what her opinion on these deep ITM calls were:\n\n>She sent me the following link about deep ITM options.  \n>  \n>[https://www.discoveroptions.com/mixed/content/education/articles/deepitmoptions.html](https://www.discoveroptions.com/mixed/content/education/articles/deepitmoptions.html)  \n>  \n>Quote from article- 'Holding deep ITM calls (or puts) is like buying (or shorting) the underlying stock in a sense, as deep ITM options move point-for-point with their underlying.\u00a0However, buying deep ITM options cost less than the stock, allowing you to either leverage up or retain cash for other investments (or to just earn interest).'\n\nYou apes are amazing, u/Aaronsmth5 just dropped this link with SEC info on deep ITM options:  [https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)\n\nHere are the Deep-ITM calls that went up on 3/17, and disappeared on 3/18:\n\n[Here today,](https://preview.redd.it/fv63e5htufq61.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01dd1cf0cdc2fc151247c8e9d06ee16893e53b19)\n\n[Gone tomorrow](https://preview.redd.it/gwy2rg7yphq61.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0e51124453b9c8e3c0688df88bc27d53686c52f)\n\nWe weren\u2019t sure, but thought perhaps these deep-ITM calls were used to create the deep ITM puts that showed up on 3/18, and that those were going to be used to short the stock throughout the day.  Turns out that was correct-\n\n[From WeBull, GME 3\\/18](https://preview.redd.it/4dk71jkuofq61.jpg?width=1923&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c3b3336c53574c4dc3d8a816b466b1b0d10b62d)\n\nThat\u2019s what happened before, can\u2019t say for sure that it will happen again. However, u/TheWhackBateman wrote a very detailed DD on [where these deep ITM calls might be coming from](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m05jed/mystery_solved_the_deep_itm_calls_are_coming_from/), and how they can be used by Melvin and Citadel to recycle the [FTDs created from all the synthetic shares they\u2019ve pumped out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhj4tm/official_sec_ftds_fail_to_deliver_march_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nNOW, back to the options from TODAY, 3/31- ~~based on today\u2019s options volume, none of these deep ITM call contracts were bought or sold today.~~    u/boneywankenobi found  the volume on barchart under the  [4/16/2021](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2021-04-16-m) and  [1/21/2022](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2022-01-21-m) expiration dates, all new positions opened today.  Let\u2019s see those options up-close  and personal on optionsonar before we leave:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqpjltz4qfq61.jpg?width=2381&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36d39ac0b5a6d7b2fd4d7aa31e712118628e9c06\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2xe9yz4qfq61.jpg?width=2405&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4817199bcf430f51b2cef7b59b630a7405f13b9c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jl1jttz4qfq61.jpg?width=2345&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d0fbaae3cb7367efd120d099ebcf0751a8ae954\n\nYou can go through them all if you want (click on the corresponding crayon), I got bored after 3.  All of these deep ITM calls seemed to be placed at exactly 13:58:28 (about 3pm eastern-ape-time).  So these contracts were put up by a market maker with 1 hour to go in the options trading day.  If your goal as an options contract seller was to make money by putting up desirable contracts for people to buy, sell, and trade, WHY would you post them 1 hour before trading ends?  (Unlike trading shares, [options trading is from 9:30 to 4 only](https://bullishbears.com/options-market-hours/)\\- there are no after-hours for options.)  Totally not suspicious.  Anyway, have your bananas ready for tomorrow\u2019s fake price action, should be bonkers!!!\n\n# Edit: TLDR; enjoy your fire sale \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 BUY AND HOLD.  DO NOT SELL, that lets Citadel cover up their fuckery.  Apes buy SHARES, throw poop at options.\n\nnot financial advice, I eat crayons and am proud of it\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19",
