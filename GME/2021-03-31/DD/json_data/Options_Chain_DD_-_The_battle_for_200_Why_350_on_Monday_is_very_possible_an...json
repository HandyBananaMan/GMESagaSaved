    "selftext": "**TL;DR - 79,812 Options are nearing the money and shorts are FUCKING scared shitless.  15,560 call options for 200c is going cause a gamma squeeze up to 350c.**\n\n*Firstly, this is not financial advice. As a disclaimer, I own shares of GME.*\n\nAPR 1, APR 9, APR 16 Total OTM options (starting at 200c) - 79,812\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1617235200&guce\\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\\_referrer\\_sig=AQAAACK-yzwtH4eqfGu2qFyLIzAyJUqcEaruVuBMiBs8jT8bSqhoaAEDAHq4X1i0ocQARIZ9u4sDsBJyE-rU-k75gdpZP39lxM-vGScp091Qn7dd96D2\\_VliJX9PC1Xuf5Xe0jUnL1gZFDH9Q0EMKMO14wvYd1VqmW\\_UPaSczdkLdReC&straddle=false](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1617235200&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACK-yzwtH4eqfGu2qFyLIzAyJUqcEaruVuBMiBs8jT8bSqhoaAEDAHq4X1i0ocQARIZ9u4sDsBJyE-rU-k75gdpZP39lxM-vGScp091Qn7dd96D2_VliJX9PC1Xuf5Xe0jUnL1gZFDH9Q0EMKMO14wvYd1VqmW_UPaSczdkLdReC&straddle=false)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAPR 1, there are 14,006 200c options expiring. 12.50% Implied Vol. Be prepare for an ALL OUT WAR on this pricepoint. Once GME starts testing 205, the MM delta hedging will easily bring GME to 220- where there are 3900 220c options. There is 26,973 options ramping up to 250c where there is 9,179 calls... Starting to see the picture?\n\nShorts ABSOLUTELY CANNOT AFFORD 200c to happen. In the case of the short trading week (whatever am I going to do this Friday?), casual retail traders are likely not going to have the ammo to buy in on Thursday. I believe that after seeing the insane price jump and no trading on Friday, any sort of GME catalyst (news, tweets, etc) will create INSANE buy interest on Monday APR 5.\n\nTo put this in perspective, GME had a $13 price increase on a measly 17mil volume. AVG trading volume for the past 3 months has been around 44mil. Hmm I wonder what happens when we actually see some REAL volume? (\\*cough\\* $116-183 \\*cough\\*)\n\nIf there's a enough buying pressure for GME to maintain a support level OVER 210 for most of the day, we could see a 350 EOD (350 gang, we're coming for you).\n\nThat being said, 200c is VERY important. Once maintained at that support level, its very likely 250 becomes the new floor as shorts start to run out of options (no pun intended).\n\nI'm not putting dates on anything, but with the annual share holders meeting coming, DFV week (APR 16 call options expiring), and GameStops amazing timing on bullish press has me pretty pumped!\n\nNow obviously, anything can happen, and I believe everyone is going HODL regardless; but don't say I didn't warn ya about 250 being the new floor because the options chain doesn't lie. I just wish I had more money to buy GME because I don't think I'll be able to buy it at $200 ever again.\n\nOne last thing: Who do YOU think owns 14,000 in call options? If you ever doubted there were institutions playing the squeeze, think again.\n\n**TL;DRv2 - $200 is the dip. 15,000 200c calls is going to rocket GME into 220, then 250, then 300... then 350. Expect a bloodbath, and don't blame me if you don't ever get to buy GME in the 200s again. Not financial advice. HODL to the moon.**",
