Fingers crossed but I think we are going to SQUEEZE. Here is the reason: We were looking in the wrong place all this time. It is not the hedgies who are on the line, it is their **prime brokers**, who are the **big banks**. Kenny G truly knows how to take care of himself, how could we have doubted his self-love?

All the sources I used are in a bibliography at the end. I want to make this as short as possible so if you want to fact check what I am saying, you can read the original sources yourself.

Every hedge fund relies on a bank to offer its services. You will not find a hedge fund without a bank.

*hedge fund + bank = higher returns*

because a hedge fund could never generate as much money as it does with its own capital. They don’t work and save and then invest. They want the tendies now. So they borrow the money to invest. That is **leverage**.

The banks give them this leverage by acting as **prime brokers (PB)**. The **traditional** form is what we are all familiar with, i.e. the PB lends cash or securities to use in transactions.

Ever since Basel III, this traditional form of prime brokerage has become very expensive. But the HFs and the PBs found a way around it called **synthetic prime brokerage**. You can read the sources for all the details but basically instead of margin lending or securities lending, synthetic financing uses derivatives to provide leveraged exposure to an underlying asset *without actually having to buy that asset*.

Banks have a big incentive to offer this cheaper form of leverage because otherwise they would lose the hedge fund business, especially for **shorting** purposes. The most popular synthetic product is the **equity swap**. In an equity swap, the risk of the **physical position** backing the swap is passed on to the broker. The broker is the one who has to go out onto the market for the physical inventory it needs to hedge. Access to physical inventory is very important because that is how the broker can sell a short swap. *Otherwise, the broker is simply taking the other side of the trade, which is exactly what it doesn’t want to do*. It wants to be neutral.

When demand is bigger than supply for a security, there are ways to ensure access to physical inventory, e.g. obtaining an exclusive right to borrow someone’s long portfolio or from ETFs. The short demand of a hedgie must be offset with long demand by the broker through access to the real shares. Since this offsetting is done internally, we cannot see it. We can only see the shorts that cannot be internalised by brokers. Which is why real short interest is very difficult to determine. One thing seems sure though, the use of ETFs in this way distorts pricing, to the point that prices may actually be driven more by ETFs than by company performance itself (i.e. fundamentals). Is that apes’ fault? No.

Given what we know about FTDs, naked short selling, etc. and the fact that apes will not let go of their shares – how much access do you think the brokers have to the physical shares of GME that they need? Um, not much?

This is also a good point for a thought on the reversal of the betas (i.e. a negative for the long, a positive for the short). When a broker internally offsets the various shorts and longs of different clients, including with the use of its own inventory, the **risk** of the long and of the short cancel out each other. What is left to hedge is only any remaining **market risk** (beta). Remember that no one can escape market risk. The market is where we live.

They cannot go long because they have no or not enough access to physical shares of GME. We know that on its worst day Melvin alone was down $16 billion from exposure to the GameStop short. But if the broker on the long side never had the inventory? If the broker always counted on being able to access inventory but apes scooped it up all at once in January and will not let go until they reach Valhalla? What if Citadel as market maker has been helping them since Jan to hedge for "doomsday" (see FT interview) by manufacturing ETF shares as Authorised Participant, OTC trades, attacking the GME price as much as possible, etc.? Attacking the entire stock market and the bond market because it makes markets in practically every traded security? So this whole time Citadel was helping its brokers? Because Kenny looks out for his friends?

If everything is hedged, that leaves only any remaining **market risk** (beta) and **GME**. Because Citadel has turned the market upside down for his broker buddies, of course the beta of GME is negative because they left it alone, they had no choice because they can’t access real shares. The shorts are still open. Now they are running out of time. Kenny G was friendly enough to announce “doomsday” for everyone to prepare and to position themselves in their *overall* portfolios.

As for GME specifically, if the brokers can’t get access to the real shares, they will be forced to take the long side (remember above, *exactly what they don't want to do*) – they will be forced to COVER. Or they go bankrupt before that. Remember the Peterffy interview? I think he was right.

**UPDATE** same date as publication of this post: I just noticed this. Which asset traditionally has a negative beta? **Gold bullion**. Watch them hedge that market risk, dang.
