<p>piss piss piss low volumeâœ… quite honestly pathetic </p>
<p>currently watching lvl 2 data screens all day and they have nothing left going for them. trading back and forth back and forth between each other. I have been watching volume all day, started with almost 3mil by 10:30am. ðŸ’ŽðŸ––</p>
<p>THIS IS WEAKðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>I expect a bit more volume to close out the day, especially with some rebalancing that I believe is happening with etfs todayðŸ˜ŽðŸš€</p>
<p>(ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€mandatory)</p>
