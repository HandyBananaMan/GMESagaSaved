I recently commented on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me7ziy/as_of_today_gurufocuscom_is_reporting_gamestops/) about the short interest data listed on Gurufocus' website being 292.53% and how the data is different from their vender, Morningstar. I decided to contact them about it and this is what they said.

Gurufocus: "My apologies for the wait. Our lead data team member is out today, but we believe the information listed may be outdated as we were having licensing issues with our data vendor. Please submit a support ticket at the following link so that our data team can follow up with you on the issue."

I submitted a support ticket, we already knew about the licensing issues (not sure who found it first but I first saw it commented about by u/humanslime) but I thought it might be interesting to hear what people who deal with this kind of data for a living would say about it.

here is there response:  "It's hard to give any subjective opinion on your question since it's a controversy. Hope you can understand. Thanks a lot for contacting us."

They admitted that **there** **is controversy over the validity of the data**. I think the fact that they didn't dismiss the idea of the data being wrong just confirms that reported values of short interest **are wrong.**

They have also since removed the out of date data from their website.
