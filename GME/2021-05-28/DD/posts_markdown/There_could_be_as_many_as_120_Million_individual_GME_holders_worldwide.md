**Edit: So it's been pointed out by a few in the comments that the 1.5% could be referring to the** **outstanding or overall float rather than the shareholders of GME. My reasoning that I don't think this is likely is that it does clearly say shareholders (although I could concede this is an error in wording)But my main issue with that argument is that 1.5% of the full 70mil float is only 1.05mil shares. eToro is the biggest broker in Europe and has 20 mil users.**

(**Thank you for updating me on the most recent percentage of eToro GME investors, which is 6.47%).  That's 1,294,000 GME holders on eToro. If we were presuming the 1.5% eToro quoted was from the float that would mean there are more GME holders on eToro than shares held by eToro. I think it's extremely unlikely that the average GME holder on eToro has just 0.8 shares each.**

**Using the current 6.47% eToro users, and assuming they mean 1.5% of GME shareholders are with eToro (as they stated) then that makes there roughly 86 million GME shareholders worldwide. (Sorry, I can't edit the title!)So, 10 shares each would equal 860 million shares!**

**Using the info given, interpreted one way means there are a fantastically low amount of shares held in the largest broker in Europe. The other interpretation is that Citadel have dug this hole so deep that there are now around 86 million GME holders world wide, owning god knows how many shares between us.**

**Now I do concede that I don't know how eToro can make this statement. Do they have information from other brokers that is shared? Could this info have been shared because of the upcoming vote?  I have no idea, which is why I tried to be clear this is possible DD, rather than DD as it's based on information that we can't independently verify.**

**None the less, it does add up with some of the recent posts I have seen regarding the SI% being upwards of 1000%**

Okay, so first thing I should say is I'm almost completely smooth in brain and body and this is my first post on Reddit so go easy.Second thing I should say is this should be flared as 'possible DD' but there isn't that option.The third thing I should say is please feel free to cross post to Superstonk, I don't have the karma required.

# I believe we can get a good understanding of just how fukd Citadel and co are from information related to eToro users.

**TA;DR:**  **According to my kwik maff, there are around 86 Million individual shareholders of GME. Meaning if we all held an average of just 10 shares we would own 860 million shares!**

So whilst I was lurking over at Superstonk this morning, peering in through the window with one hand on my banana I saw this post by  u/Silver-Reserve-3764  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmos5k/what\_the\_actual\_fuck\_did\_etoro\_just\_say/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmos5k/what_the_actual_fuck_did_etoro_just_say/)

[etoro users account for around 1.5&#37; of all GME shareholders](https://preview.redd.it/b8bctq3ott171.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e8e211a329de952020b864d116989b25b6546b)

Now we know eToro claim to have 20 million users worldwide.[https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/etoro-updates/20m-users/#:\~:text=We%20can%20now%20say%20it,20%20million%20registered%20users%20worldwide](https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/etoro-updates/20m-users/#:~:text=We%20can%20now%20say%20it,20%20million%20registered%20users%20worldwide)

So now I wanted to find out what percentage of eToro users hold GME. Well I looked everywhere on eToro but it appears they have taken this info down. Customer services were no help so I had to go off previous posts on this information. If anyone can find this current info please let me know! I can't confirm accurate information on this myself or provide links but based on these three previous posts it seems clear that this information was (at one point) provided by eToro.

This post from  u/Anthony-Bluebeard  from 2 months ago[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m82afl/909\_of\_etoros\_20\_mil\_users\_holding\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m82afl/909_of_etoros_20_mil_users_holding_gme/)states that 9.09% of eToro investors hold GME

and this post from  u/circusmonkey89  from 1 month ago![https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mw09f7/etoro\_user\_stats\_for\_gme\_good\_hodling\_apes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mw09f7/etoro_user_stats_for_gme_good_hodling_apes/)states that 8.31% of eToro investors hold GME

**EDIT: I have deleted the old calculations and replaced them with the more accurate ones based on todays eToro figures for GME holders. That figure has been quoted several times in the comments as 6.47% so let's work from that.**

**eToro have 20Mil users. 6.47% own GME. That means 1,294,000 own GME on eToro.**

**eToro claim to their investors account for 1.5% of ALL GME shareholders.**

**1% of all GME shareholders worldwide would = 862,666 x 100 = 86,266,666**

**86.2 Million shareholders worldwide. That would mean, if eToro users really do only make up 1.5% of the worlds GME shareholders that if we averaged just 10 shares each we would have over 862 million shares.**
