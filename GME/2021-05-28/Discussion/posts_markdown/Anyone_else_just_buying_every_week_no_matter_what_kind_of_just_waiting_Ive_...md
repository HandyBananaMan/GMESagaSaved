#Title: Anyone else just buying every week no matter what, kind of just waiting? I’ve read so much DD I’m just waiting for my 25 million per share payout.

Literally the title. 
All I do is buy and hold. Plus I voted already.

I feel like there’s so much stress, maybe it’s the new people. Cause if you’ve read the DD for months now you kind of enter a zen mode. At least I have. Keep buying every week they drag this along and just wait for the money :)



Not financial advice lol
