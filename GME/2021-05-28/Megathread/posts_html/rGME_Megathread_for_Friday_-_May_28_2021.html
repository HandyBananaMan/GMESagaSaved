<p>This is a place to discuss technical analysis, fundamental analysis, buyer/seller sentiment, <strong>and all things relevant to GME.</strong></p>
<p>New Mod Announcements: (Update today)(this will now be semi daily updates)</p>
<ul>
<li>Good Morning/Night 🦍s, Yesterday was intresting 🤔,  seeing a huge influx of none GME stonk chatter, the name of this sub is r/GME it's what 🦍s come here to talk about. This has always been the focus and i hope for those that don't understand why they look into the Compliation DD at the bottom and the MegaThreads that have been previously posted as well as todays.</li>
<li>First 🦍s some news on why we still have upward movement <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the_dd_has_once_again_proven_to_be_true/gzfa2o5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">FTDs can still be causing the volume</a> as its apparently not T+21 and T+35, but T+22 and T+36 (🦍s have a notoriously hard time with these dates 😋) along with the FTDs there are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nkxvix/27584_call_contracts_at_200_are_now_itm_and/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">2,758,400 shares that are ITM @ 200$ Calls</a>, plus an additional <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmgln0/gme_option_chain_for_tomorrow_and_next_week_5k/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">500,000 shares that are ITM @ 250$</a> and there's also an additional 1,500,000 shares ITM at 300$, seems like GME is ramping up through a Gamma Squeeze because of the FTD Cycle.</li>
<li>Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmkjzc/srocc2021003_approved_52721_lets_goo/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">big rule change</a> increasing options deposits passed, this isn't The One, remember the important rule change is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ngx791/stdtc2021005_update/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">one that marks each share</a> fixing the options/FTD abuse causing 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (the first rule looks like their giving Shitedal another chance via a Gamma to get out of 💎🙌s grip 🤣🤣🤣, but in case it fucks up they asked for more deposits upfront first, to bad 🦍s already know Hedgies R Fuk 🚀🚀)</li>
<li>how Fucked? well an 🐜/🦍 did the math and Hedgies are fuk with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LostVirginityToGME/comments/nlyjy9/koreans_are_holding_727404_shares_despite_being/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">363 Million Shares sold Short</a>,  wait nope sorry they did the math wrong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlyo13/koreans_are_holding_727404_shares_despite_being/gzlp69o?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">its actually 3.5 Billion shares</a> 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 speaking of Korean holdings, here's a fun fact of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nlyz3h/for_all_of_us_apes_and_apettes_who_are_learning/gzn0vav?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">Why Korean 🦍s are called 🐜s</a></li>
<li>With all those shares short, Shitedal would have a huge ball of cash to pile into assets because of all the margin requirements, this would explain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmcqws/reverse_repo_overnight_lending_chart_update_for/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">the reverse repo</a> behavior, it isn't about getting more cash its about getting more cash sinks(investment vechiles) to put all the cash in, this is especially compounded with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the_dd_has_once_again_proven_to_be_true/gzgkxn5?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">0% Interest rates over this whole month</a>. The Illegal printer is creating hyperinflation havoc on the stock market with all that excess cash, maybe 🚀 to fix it, FED? maybe taxes for you?</li>
<li>The maths should help 🦍s conceptualize that 🦍s own multiples of the float (many previous DDs have pointed this out too), because im seeing misinformation here's some sound logic/reasoning on why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyb5gab?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">selling on the way down is FUD/Bad for 🦍s</a>,  here's also why <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n9ix5o/limit_orders_vs_market_orders_and_attention_uk/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Market Orders are bad</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmcpqi/this_is_why_you_dont_have_stop_limits_set/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">why Stop Losses are bad</a></li>
<li>This part is useful for those that haven't followed GameStop closely, we talked about Gamestops NFTs yesterday, so here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m52roc/how_gamestop_will_reinvent_the_gaming_marketplace/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">a great post</a> about Papa Ryan Cohen and Gamestops potential future. For 🦍s that don't know here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmcp68/a_company_with_such_a_team_could_never_fail_all/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Ryan Cohens A Team</a>,  doubling down on NFTs/Crypto <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nlj69m/did_you_know_you_can_spend_cryptocurrencies_like/gzisewz?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">Gamestop allows purchases with Crypto</a> and as a final reminder <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nm758i/this_mornings_premarket_is_a_tiny_blip_and_gme_is/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">zoom out when in doubt</a>. This is a good time to say i like the stock, i like the company, i like Ryan Cohen, i like his team, and i like where this is going 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</li>
<li>There was another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmg1q0/527_sec_whistleblower_award_claims_42_million/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">giant whistleblower claim</a>, apparently 2 tried to claim the same award for the same investgation 🐍s jumping ship fast for award Money 😂</li>
<li>Fidelity users bewaee there's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nlr5pf/fidelity_phishing_text_call_to_report_back_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Phishing text scam</a> going around.</li>
<li>To close we have sad/good news Walmart DFV is no longer able to buy Gamestop and become our 🦍 boss, because GME isnt trading sideways, but the good news <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nkz846/i_will_own_gamestop_update_may_25_final_update/gzfmukq?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">is he's joining 💎🙌🦍s</a></li>
