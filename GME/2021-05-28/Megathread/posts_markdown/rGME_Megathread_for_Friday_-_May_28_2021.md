This is a place to discuss technical analysis, fundamental analysis, buyer/seller sentiment, **and all things relevant to GME.**

New Mod Announcements: (Update today)(this will now be semi daily updates)

* Good Morning/Night 🦍s, Yesterday was intresting 🤔,  seeing a huge influx of none GME stonk chatter, the name of this sub is r/GME it's what 🦍s come here to talk about. This has always been the focus and i hope for those that don't understand why they look into the Compliation DD at the bottom and the MegaThreads that have been previously posted as well as todays.
* First 🦍s some news on why we still have upward movement [FTDs can still be causing the volume](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the_dd_has_once_again_proven_to_be_true/gzfa2o5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) as its apparently not T+21 and T+35, but T+22 and T+36 (🦍s have a notoriously hard time with these dates 😋) along with the FTDs there are [2,758,400 shares that are ITM @ 200$ Calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nkxvix/27584_call_contracts_at_200_are_now_itm_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), plus an additional [500,000 shares that are ITM @ 250$](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmgln0/gme_option_chain_for_tomorrow_and_next_week_5k/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and there's also an additional 1,500,000 shares ITM at 300$, seems like GME is ramping up through a Gamma Squeeze because of the FTD Cycle.
* Another [big rule change](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmkjzc/srocc2021003_approved_52721_lets_goo/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) increasing options deposits passed, this isn't The One, remember the important rule change is the [one that marks each share](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ngx791/stdtc2021005_update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) fixing the options/FTD abuse causing 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (the first rule looks like their giving Shitedal another chance via a Gamma to get out of 💎🙌s grip 🤣🤣🤣, but in case it fucks up they asked for more deposits upfront first, to bad 🦍s already know Hedgies R Fuk 🚀🚀)
* how Fucked? well an 🐜/🦍 did the math and Hedgies are fuk with [363 Million Shares sold Short](https://www.reddit.com/user/LostVirginityToGME/comments/nlyjy9/koreans_are_holding_727404_shares_despite_being/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share),  wait nope sorry they did the math wrong [its actually 3.5 Billion shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlyo13/koreans_are_holding_727404_shares_despite_being/gzlp69o?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 speaking of Korean holdings, here's a fun fact of [Why Korean 🦍s are called 🐜s](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nlyz3h/for_all_of_us_apes_and_apettes_who_are_learning/gzn0vav?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)
* With all those shares short, Shitedal would have a huge ball of cash to pile into assets because of all the margin requirements, this would explain [the reverse repo](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmcqws/reverse_repo_overnight_lending_chart_update_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) behavior, it isn't about getting more cash its about getting more cash sinks(investment vechiles) to put all the cash in, this is especially compounded with the [0% Interest rates over this whole month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the_dd_has_once_again_proven_to_be_true/gzgkxn5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). The Illegal printer is creating hyperinflation havoc on the stock market with all that excess cash, maybe 🚀 to fix it, FED? maybe taxes for you?
* The maths should help 🦍s conceptualize that 🦍s own multiples of the float (many previous DDs have pointed this out too), because im seeing misinformation here's some sound logic/reasoning on why [selling on the way down is FUD/Bad for 🦍s](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyb5gab?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3),  here's also why [Market Orders are bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n9ix5o/limit_orders_vs_market_orders_and_attention_uk/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [why Stop Losses are bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmcpqi/this_is_why_you_dont_have_stop_limits_set/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
* This part is useful for those that haven't followed GameStop closely, we talked about Gamestops NFTs yesterday, so here's [a great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m52roc/how_gamestop_will_reinvent_the_gaming_marketplace/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) about Papa Ryan Cohen and Gamestops potential future. For 🦍s that don't know here's [Ryan Cohens A Team](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmcp68/a_company_with_such_a_team_could_never_fail_all/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share),  doubling down on NFTs/Crypto [Gamestop allows purchases with Crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nlj69m/did_you_know_you_can_spend_cryptocurrencies_like/gzisewz?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) and as a final reminder [zoom out when in doubt](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nm758i/this_mornings_premarket_is_a_tiny_blip_and_gme_is/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This is a good time to say i like the stock, i like the company, i like Ryan Cohen, i like his team, and i like where this is going 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
* There was another [giant whistleblower claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmg1q0/527_sec_whistleblower_award_claims_42_million/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), apparently 2 tried to claim the same award for the same investgation 🐍s jumping ship fast for award Money 😂
* Fidelity users bewaee there's a [Phishing text scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nlr5pf/fidelity_phishing_text_call_to_report_back_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) going around.
* To close we have sad/good news Walmart DFV is no longer able to buy Gamestop and become our 🦍 boss, because GME isnt trading sideways, but the good news [is he's joining 💎🙌🦍s](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nkz846/i_will_own_gamestop_update_may_25_final_update/gzfmukq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)
