<p>Any share price is a steal compared to where this is going.   But a small dip like this makes me feel like it’s a little bargain.  </p>
<p>Been hodling since $325. Down to $40.  This ride won’t shake me.  We’ve been manipulated and abused long enough.  I just wanted money at first. Now I want payback.  </p>
<p>Buy, hodl, disregard FUD.</p>
<p>EDIT:  my post triggered a user to harass me into proving my positions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnhhh9/the_challenge_has_been_thrown/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">so this happened </a></p>
