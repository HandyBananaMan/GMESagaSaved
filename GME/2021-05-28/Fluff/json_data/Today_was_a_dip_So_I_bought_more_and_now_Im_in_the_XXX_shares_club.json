This ride won\u2019t shake me.  We\u2019ve been manipulated and abused long enough.  I just wanted money at first. Now I want payback.  \n\nBuy, hodl, disregard FUD.\n\nEDIT:  my post triggered a user to harass me into proving my positions [so this happened ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnhhh9/the_challenge_has_been_thrown/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",
