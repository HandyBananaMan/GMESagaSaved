Any share price is a steal compared to where this is going.   But a small dip like this makes me feel like it’s a little bargain.  

Been hodling since $325. Down to $40.  This ride won’t shake me.  We’ve been manipulated and abused long enough.  I just wanted money at first. Now I want payback.  

Buy, hodl, disregard FUD.
