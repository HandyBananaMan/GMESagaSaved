<p>“On the whole, Griffin says he is optimistic on the outlook, and hailed the retail trading boom as a way for more Americans to benefit from the US stock market. But he warned of a “doomsday” scenario win which accelerating inflation deepens a bond market sell-off, sends stocks tumbling and stokes unrest among retail investors hurt in the process.”</p>
<p>“The fund stepped in to bail out Melvin Capital, one of the biggest hedge funds betting against GameStop. <strong>When Robinhood, a brokerage popular with the new generation of retail traders, was subsequently forced for regulatory reasons to curtail trading in GameStop, many Reddit users seized on a conspiracy theory that it was at Citadel’s behest.</strong> Citadel Securities — a separate high-speed market-maker also owned by Griffin — is one of Robinhood’s biggest revenue sources, paying it for the right to execute the trades of its customers.”</p>
<p>“Griffin highlighted how an oblique tweet of a McDonald’s ice cream cone and a frog emoji from Ryan Cohen, a big GameStop shareholder, appeared to be the spark for a doubling of the stock’s price in one afternoon in February.”</p>
<p>“The fact that the tweet of an ice cream cone can move markets will be the subject of academic study for years,” Griffin said. <strong>“It represents a dynamic where certain stocks are now almost exclusively owned by retail and passive funds.</strong> You’ve taken out active investors who focus on traditional metrics in valuing an equity.”</p>
<p>Sounds like someone is scared. Only confirms the inevitable. </p>
