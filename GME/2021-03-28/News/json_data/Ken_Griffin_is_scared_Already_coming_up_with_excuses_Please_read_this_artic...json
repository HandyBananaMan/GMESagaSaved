But he warned of a \u201cdoomsday\u201d scenario win which accelerating inflation deepens a bond market sell-off, sends stocks tumbling and stokes unrest among retail investors hurt in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fund stepped in to bail out Melvin Capital, one of the biggest hedge funds betting against GameStop. **When Robinhood, a brokerage popular with the new generation of retail traders, was subsequently forced for regulatory reasons to curtail trading in GameStop, many Reddit users seized on a conspiracy theory that it was at Citadel\u2019s behest.** Citadel Securities \u2014 a separate high-speed market-maker also owned by Griffin \u2014 is one of Robinhood\u2019s biggest revenue sources, paying it for the right to execute the trades of its customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cGriffin highlighted how an oblique tweet of a McDonald\u2019s ice cream cone and a frog emoji from Ryan Cohen, a big GameStop shareholder, appeared to be the spark for a doubling of the stock\u2019s price in one afternoon in February.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the tweet of an ice cream cone can move markets will be the subject of academic study for years,\u201d Griffin said. **\u201cIt represents a dynamic where certain stocks are now almost exclusively owned by retail and passive funds.** You\u2019ve taken out active investors who focus on traditional metrics in valuing an equity.\u201d\n\nSounds like someone is scared. Only confirms the inevitable. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d\n\nEdit: I\u2019m aware there is a paywall, I want to post the entire article, but due to copyright reasons, I cannot post the entire article.
