About an hour ago as of the publication of this post, I went to the FT and was FLOORED to see Kenny G in a subheadline under the Archegos story warning about "inflation risk" and that the "stimulus cheques" will trigger inflation and that the retail boom combined with ETFs will crash the market. This is exactly what I said in my "mystery of the negative beta solved" post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcwu5m/mystery\_of\_the\_negative\_beta\_solved\_hfs\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcwu5m/mystery_of_the_negative_beta_solved_hfs_are/)) - that the GME hedgies are net short on their portfolio, that they flipped the betas to engineer a market crash and to come out of it with a profit and that ETFs are possibly the intersection and most vulnerable risk point of the markets. But I could not have imagined what kind of a troll of all trolls you have to be to go on the FT and shamelessly in front of the financial media and your financial colleagues say that "doomsday" is coming, caused by bonds, retail traders and inflation. Of course it doesn't make sense. Any financial professional will know that. It is a big FU to apes but it is also a big FU to everyone in the market. Kenny G wants everyone to know that he can do what he wants.

Let me translate for Kenny G: "I know that you know. You know that I know. FU apes. I'm burning this house down. And FU all asset managers, pension funds, mutual funds, etc. in the market. I'm shaking you out with this Archegos sell-off because if you don't sell out now out of the stocks you like, the burn is going to be worse. Eat my inflation analysis." It is basically one big troll post. He put it in the FT so that the normies wouldn't see it.

He even reproduces the chart that I kept showing of the retail traders and market makers. But in a mocking way. Twisting it to say that it will be our fault for changing the market. It's really passive aggressive. I don't want to link to the article directly. Go to the FT for yourself to see it.

As for the Archegos story, I was very suspicious about it, I am suspicious that Yahoo (my beta troll) had the exclusive on this, printing the story ahead of everyone else with "Exclusive" in the headline, and cites only their "sources" and "people familiar with the matter". CNBC is also very sure about the reliability of the "sources". Everyone else though is only "wondering" or reporting that this is "said" to be the case.

Remember when Forbes put out the article about how apes trading options are so powerful they can move the prices and options apes got excited but we have pretty much established that apart from scalping you, options trading can only hurt the MOASS. Be suspicious when they praise us.

Also weird was yesterday, FT put out a very polite 15-minute video about GameStop and how the apes "won".

My (very speculative) guess: Apes will see the short squeeze. Some apes will get rich. Some apes and other retail participants will lose money. The market will crash. Kenny G is hedged with his flipped betas. Kenny G is pointing the finger now ahead of time and saying apes can blame themselves for the destruction. I really hope I am wrong.
