    "selftext": "**TO BE CLEAR. BLACKROCK/VANGUARD DID _NOT_ LIQUIDATE GME.** They may have been involved in the mass block sale event on Friday though.\n\nTL;DR: Vanguard/BlackRock/Morgan were the only people with enough stock to cover the block trades and now have a metric craptonne of tendies to abuse Citadel with.\n\nEDIT 4: Last edit of the night before I pass out. I've been digging into Archegos. Andy Mills features prominantly. From his linkedin, he is the Executive Chairman and Co-CEO, Archegos Capital Mgmt. Okay, cool. Why do I care? If you read [this SEC report](https://sec.report/Document/0001209191-20-062341/), you can see that he has quite a few insider shares of a thing called \"VERISK ANALYTICS, INC\". Their [page on him here](https://www.verisk.com/about/leadership/board-of-directors/andrew-g-mills/) states:\n\n> Andrew (\u201cAndy\u201d) G. Mills has served as one of Verisk's directors since 2002, bringing decades of leadership experience in growing revenue through new product development and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses. Mr. Mills is executive chairman and co-CEO of Archegos Capital Management\n\nSo I dug a little more into Archegos. It has 4 funds:\n\nhttps://lei.report/LEI/549300D1883NDC6G4788\n\nhttps://lei.report/LEI/549300CSTYJ8CNTSEW70\n\nhttps://lei.report/LEI/7XJEXKPMDBBFE54NSV14\n\nhttps://lei.report/LEI/549300AROAD6DJRZ8O71\n\nBut again, none of them seem to actually do anything. What I did find, over on fintel, is a guy called [Brian D. Jones](http://www.bankcap.com/bankcap_team.php?id=1), who also works at Archegos. He's associated to [Atlantic Capital Bancshares](https://fintel.io/so/us/acbi).\n\nSo, I still think Archegos is a bunch of bullshit, but it ties some people together.\n\nBack to Verisk. Verisk do this:\n\n> Verisk Analytics, Inc. is an American data analytics and risk assessment firm based in Jersey City, New Jersey, with customers in insurance, natural resources, financial services, government, and risk management sectors. The company uses proprietary data sets and industry expertise to provide predictive analytics and decision support consultations in areas including fraud prevention, actuarial science, insurance coverage, fire protection, catastrophe and weather risk, and data management.\n\nHuh. Insurance and actuarial science, you say?\n\nAlright... but [who owns Verisk?](https://fintel.io/so/us/vrsk). That's right... Vanguard, Blackrock, and Morgan Stanley.\n\nWho owns Atlantic Capital Bancshares? That's right... Blackrock and Vanguard.\n\nThis is becoming more tin-foil-hatted by the second.\n\nWho else is an insider of this Verisk thing? This guy: https://fintel.io/n/wright-david-b, and he's a Director of Geeknet Inc, the \"brand\" of all those t-shirts you guys have been buying from Gamestop that tell us how the moon is near.\n\nAnd this guy: https://fintel.io/n/shavel-lee, who is an EVP at NASDAQ.\n\nSo maybe it was Archegos all along, but not for any of the reasons we thought? I don't know. I do know that Vanguard and Blackrock are certainly involved in all of this, along with... others.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Added Goldman Sach's 13F holdings for each symbol. Post now needs a bit of scroll-right to see the other players who have holdings higher than required to provide the assets for the block sale.\n\n---\n\nEdit2: Added links to fintel pages for all of the tickers. Changed the flair from DD to Discussion because yes, I'm speculating, based off 13F source data rather than a CNBC article.\n\n---\n\nEdit 3: Actually no. This is Due Dilligence. I literally spent 3 hours going through the 13F data for every single block trade pulling *actual numbers* to attempt to explain the block trade origin. That is what Due Dilligence is. I didn't set out to prove that it was Blackrock/Vanguard/Your Mom, that's just the conclusion that the numbers support based on the proportion of these where litereally no-one else has that share availability. My conclusion is the speculation in this post, take it as you will.\n\n---\n\nOkay, first off, go look at [this tweet of the bloomberg terminal](https://twitter.com/AnalystDC/status/1375517530723352578/photo/1) that notes the size and type of blocks that were sold.\n\nNext, go look [at the ownership of blackrock](https://fintel.io/so/us/blk). Vanguard/Blackrock own lots of BLK, Morgan owns a bit too. That matters because it helps to explain why they might play nice together to cover the liquidity where Blackrock is short. They are both very long in GME, and they both stand to gain a lot more than 10bn dollars if the MOASS happens.\n\nMy approach to this was simply to go through every single fintel page, and to look at who owned what based on the most recent set of 13Fs. The data is out of date as the most recent period ends 31 December 2020.\n\nCool... now let me show you a cute table - all data is from fintel, except the liquidity column which I generated by Block Size Sold \\* midpoint price between peak and bottom on Friday during the firesale:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ticker with link to fintel ownership page.|Block Size Sold|Rough amount of liquidity from selling|Citadel's holdings|Blackrock/Vanguard combined holdings|Blackrock/Vanguard combined holdings incl. ETFs, etc. (if shortfall)|Goldman's Holdings|Nearest other ownership above Block Size (no funds/etfs/etc)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[I-Q](https://fintel.io/so/us/iq)|32.7mm|588.6mm|1.4m|19.35mm|29.63|**24.7m**|Morgan Stanley|\n|[V-I-A-C](https://fintel.io/so/us/viac)|35mm|1.75bn|452k|105.7mm|Un-needed|**11.8m**|Credit Suisse / State Street|\n|[S-H-O-P](https://fintel.io/so/us/shop)|762k|800mm|49.5k|3.67mm|Un-needed|**1m**|Sands Capital Management|\n|[F-T-C-H](https://fintel.io/so/us/ftch)|26mm|1.48bn|3.1mm|7.2mm|12mm|**6.9m**|T Rowe Price / Morgan Stanley|\n|[D-I-S-C-K](https://fintel.io/so/us/disck)|32mm|1.3bn|233k|56mm|Un-needed|**699k**|**Only Vanguard has enough shares to do this block size.**|\n|[D-I-S-C-A](https://fintel.io/so/us/disca)|16mm|720mm|512k|32.53mm|Un-needed|**2.75m**|**Only Vanguard has enough shares to do this block size.**|\n|[V-I-P-S](https://fintel.io/so/us/vips)|32mm|1bn|3.11mm|35.5mm|Un-needed|**18m**|Morgan Stanley|\n|[T-M-E](https://fintel.io/so/us/tme)|50mm|850mm|17.9k|41mm|Un-needed|**24.8m**|Credit Suisse (53mm), Morgan Stanley (48mm)|\n|[B-I-D-U](https://fintel.io/so/us/bidu)|10mm|1.9bn|520k|22mm|Un-needed|**3.6m**|**Only Blackrock has enough shares to do this block size**|\n\nIn most cases, fintel data also showed that Citadel was weighted more on calls in all of the above, so they took a beating and didn't make out well on their puts would be my guess as to why these were chosen. As of close though, their total haircut was ~$28.8mm (open-close)*shares, which is a drop in the bucket.\n\nAlso, all of these stocks tanked on Wednesday pretty significantly.\n\nNow, this data is from the most recent 13F filings, which means it is by default long out of date, but in all but 2 cases, Blackrock/Vanguard have more than enough shares available to do a massive block transaction and haircut a huge amount off the books while freeing up a lot of liquidity for themselves. To do what with? I'm not sure. In the case of the two shortfalls, Morgan Stanley has plenty to cover, and they also seem to have some kind of relationship with Blackrock and Vanguard according to institutional ownership.\n\nMy thesis is that the news about that \"tiger cub\" fund Archegos that has never filed a single document [with the SEC other than a registration](https://sec.report/CIK/0001535709) is a bit farfetch(ed) (please forgive the pun) given the volume of trades going on here, and that BlackRock (friends of RC, long on GME), and Vanguard (long on GME, very long on BlackRock) liquidated a bunch of their assets via Goldman.\n\nIf I'm right, then Blackrock/Vanguard and possibly Morgan Stanley together now sit on a war-chest of **10.3bn**",
