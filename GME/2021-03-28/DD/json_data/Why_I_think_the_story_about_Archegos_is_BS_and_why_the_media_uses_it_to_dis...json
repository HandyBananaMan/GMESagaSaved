    "selftext": "First: This is not financial advice and is intended for entertainment only. I do hold a long position in GME.\n\nEdit: ~~Ever since I posted this my Reddit is acting up super weird. Never happened before. I couldn't log in anymore. Neither on my phone nor on my PC (different internet connections). So either Reddit had server problems or I'm being targeted. If this edit goes through: Pls save and screenshot this in case my account gets deleted or anything.~~  \nAppears to be a server wide problem, so probably no targeting. I was a little scared, not gonna lie.\n\nThis is a DD but it is closer to a meta analysis of other DDs I've read. There are some very thorough DDs that are trying to make a link of the story that the media is pushing of this HF called Archegos being the reason for the sudden price drops of certain stocks on the market. One of the most detailed is this one in my opinion: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mesrdk/archegos\\_capital\\_is\\_a\\_hedge\\_fund\\_that\\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mesrdk/archegos_capital_is_a_hedge_fund_that_is/)\n\nNow I appreciate the work and the detail that went into this DD and I in no way intend to call OP of this post a shill. I think he's a smart dude that just tried to connect the dots. However I'm now at the point where I get suspicious when the media agenda and GME agenda align. Might sound a bit tinfoily but if you've also lived through this story since pre January 28th you know that you can't really blame me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why do I think that the story of Archegos is just a facade? Well  [u/xpurplexamyx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xpurplexamyx/)  pointed out quite well that the sell-off was of such a magnitude that it would at least have had to be disclosed in an SEC filing when they initially acquired these stocks. The sell-off exceeded the amount of 5% of the stock so they would have had to be in possession of more than 5% of the existing stocks. As stated in Regulation 13D a Schedule 13D must be filed within 10 days of crossing the 5% ownership threshold.  However there is nothing to be found about Archegos ever filing for such a huge long position. \nLong story short: You can't liquidate something that you don't possess. As a matter of fact he states that Blackrock/Vanguard are the only ones that even had the nessesary amount to sell off a block of the size that was seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[For more detail see the link bellow of the original post](https://preview.redd.it/6jbru8dl7rp61.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc5df7d635539d0eb98de19349a3fe43dabd0dc3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mewwrp/i\\_think\\_it\\_was\\_blackrockvanguard\\_that\\_liquidated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mewwrp/i_think_it_was_blackrockvanguard_that_liquidated/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo why would Blackrock do this? Well [u/xpurplexamyx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xpurplexamyx/) states that this move would have given Blackrock about 10bn of liquidity in a very short time. Now if they just wanted to do this because they were maybe thinking of the market crashing in the future then they would have sold it off more slowly (as stated by u/Solar_Nebula ). That way they wouldn't have crashed the price of their own long position. So they needed money quickly. As to why is up to speculation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the juicy speculation:\n\nBlackrock is known to have the third largest long position in GME.[https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership](https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership)So they would be one of the whales that would profit the most of a squeeze. And since they were on the other side of a squeeze back last year with Tesla I'm pretty sure that they can't wait to turn the tables. Gaining liquidity in such a short time was a move that was probably pretty unexpected by the shorters. Their oponents now hold 10bn liquidity to do all kinds of shennanigans to make this mf moon. They've got an oportunity to gain billions off of a GME squeeze. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe media (CNBC for the biggest part) are pretty much the c\\*cksuckers of Citadel.[https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/cnbc-posts-edited-video-house-financial-services-gamestop-hearing-deleting-dennis-kelleher](https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/cnbc-posts-edited-video-house-financial-services-gamestop-hearing-deleting-dennis-kelleher)So they try to blame this drop on some shady HF that was rebranded like 2 or 3 years ago and that no one has ever heard of before. Now this HF is supposed to have had billions in long positions which none of them were disclosed to the SEC? Press X for doubt my dude. They don't want attention of this being recognised as a possible preperation for war of big whales against Citadel. So they push this margin call bs and try to motivate us to buy those shares that were sold-off.\n\nThose are my thoughts on the current situation. Pls let me know what you guys think.\n\nEdit: Included the part of Regulation 13D",
