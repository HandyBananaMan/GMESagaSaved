<p>DFV has lost money holding onto his 4/16 call options, rather than sell the contracts and just buy the equivalent shares over the past several months.  Sure, he paid $1k total for these options and they‚Äôre now worth millions, but he has missed out on EVEN MORE gains by continuing to hold them.  The objective of this post is to take a moment to consider what this might tell us. </p>
<p>(Skip this paragraph if you already understand options contracts)</p>
<p>An option is a contract which gives the owner the option (but not an obligation) to purchase, or sell 100 shares at a set price called the strike, for a limited amount of time, at which point they expire - and these options can be traded on the open market between investors prior to expiry.  I‚Äôm not going to make this unnecessarily long by explaining everything there is to know about stock options, I‚Äôll instead get straight to the most relevant things you need to know to follow along.  DFV aka roaring kitty aka Keith Gill, is the brilliant legend that gifted reddit with the knowledge and proof that Gamestop is a great investment, who owns 100,000 shares.  He also owns (500) $12 strike call options that expire on 4/16, giving him the option to purchase a total of 50,000 shares for $12 each prior to that date.  As each share of GME is substantially higher than the strike price, these calls are considered very deep ‚Äòin the money‚Äô (ITM) as their intrinsic value is GME current share price $181 minus $12 strike price = $169 gross profit per share x100 shares (not including the cost of the option contract itself) - so they are indeed quite valuable.  However, as all options contracts expire, they also have ‚Äòextrinsic‚Äô value, which is basically a combination of how volatile the stock is, and how much time is left before expiration.  This portion of options valuation is quite literally the embodiment of the phrase ‚Äútime is money‚Äù.  Even though the option contracts he owns are extremely valuable, and rise (and fall) exponentially in lock-step with GME stock price movement - he is losing money every single day due to ‚Äòtheta‚Äô, one of the many metrics used to assess the value of an option - and he‚Äôs letting that happen on purpose, which is obviously not a great trading strategy.  </p>
<p>Ok, so now everyone knows who DFV is and what he‚Äôs holding.  At any point in time, he could exercise his call options and purchase the shares for $12 each - however in doing so, he destroys the extrinsic value of the options.  With a stock as volatile as GME - lets just keep this high level and say that theta (time) is quite valuable.  He has had countless opportunities to sell these call options at peaks, and use the massive proceeds from the sales to purchase tens of thousands of shares with the proceeds - essentially increasing the amount of shares he holds, for free.  I don‚Äôt understand why this hasn‚Äôt been a widely discussed topic.</p>
<p>All we know for certain: he is not a cat, he is quite smart, and he really likes this stock.  So it is my belief that his decision to hang onto these call options is very much intentional, and tips his hand as to what he believes is to come.  </p>
<p>We all know what happened the week of the great Robinhood robbery, 1/28.  As confirmed multiple times by Tom Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) as said on national tv that all hell was about to break loose before brokers nerfed the ‚Äòbuy‚Äô button to aid short participants in tanking the stock.</p>

<p>If you pay careful attention to what he was saying: the sheer volume of call options that became ITM would have commanded the tranfer of far more shares than could actually be delivered.  No one is letting an ITM option expire worthless, they would be sold to close by the investor or broker, or pay to exercise and have the shares assigned - but regardless, shares far exceeding the amount that actually exist would have had to change hands.  This alone could cause an infinite money glitch.  Sprinkle in the high short interest (borrowed shares, which at the time was listed as 140% of the available amount of shares) on top and well, he‚Äôs right - the result would be a massive systemic event.  But the call options alone had the power to tip the first domino - and they damn near did.  </p>
<p>We are now seeing increased restrictions for call writing (selling / creating call options).  Those publishing DD on the crazy volume and unusual activity we‚Äôre seeing in the options market confirm that there are very powerful forces participating in options trading of GME.  As an effect of low liquidity due to an army of apes buying and holding, this options activity appears to be what‚Äôs behind the wheel of the stock price.  When lots of calls are going ITM - market makers need to buy more shares to have on hand so they‚Äôre ready to change hands, which drives the price up.  That‚Äôs what happened at the end of January.  To combat this, shorts / üåàüêª buy lots of put options, which has the opposite effect.  This appears to be a tug of war, and the force of those tugs is amplified by low liquidity made possible by you fine apes simply holding. </p>
<p>So, we know the biggest squeeze to ever occur was primed to blow based on an absurd amount call options going ITM.  If I‚Äôm not mistaken - every single option in the chain expiring the week prior to the great robbery - were ITM upon expiry - which due to the MM implications described above, slingshotted the price up.  That would have happened again the week of the 28th had vlad and his üåàüêª friends not cheated to save their own ass, but GME would have surely reached escape velocity as a result and the shorts would have gone tits up, triggering the MOASS.  This effect of MM‚Äôs acquiring shares to hedge against these ITM calls is referred to a ‚Äògamma squeeze‚Äô, again, which I‚Äôm not going to get into further detail on, and it is well documented on the googles - but it was the call options that were the orange legendary weapon that would have been all that was needed to beat the game.  And DFV has fucking 500 of them.  </p>
<p>So the squeeze could be triggered by lots of things at this point - a hedgefund short on GME running out of money to fight their losing war, the SEC stepping in to address absurd level of FTDs or change the rules on short interest reporting or even bringing up charges on one of these bad market participants like Citadel (not holding my breath for them though), the DTCC / NSCC stepping in demanding SLD‚Äôs to hedge these risky plays (this seems likely), or even just news coming out that gets retail to fomo and pile back in - the gamma squeeze is the only sure fire way to make this go interstellar and it requires no outside influences.  It almost caused the whole thing to melt down already, and it very well may happen again.</p>
<p>So, with all this in mind: Why the fuck is DFV still holding these options?  He‚Äôs clearly got enough money from profits taken earlier to exercise these $12 call options as it would only cost him $600k to do so, and he shows $10m in cash right there on his yolo update spreadsheet.  He likes the stock so much he just bought 50,000 more shares following the first congressional hearing (to make it the cool 100k shares he has now total) - where it seems extremely unlikely he would just take profits from these calls instead of continuing to add to his position. </p>
<p>DFV is being sued by hedgefunds who shorted GME and claimed he manipulated the market (LOL @ butthurt üåàüêª) - so maybe that has affected his available choices.  If his intention was to sell these calls for profit, it‚Äôs possible he was advised not to by his council, as that could potentially be used as part of the claim against him in court that he manipulated the stock for personal profit (again, lol). </p>
<p>So he has consciously held these calls instead of cashing them out, instead of selling them and using the proceeds to buy more stock, instead of exercising them to be assigned the shares - and he‚Äôs consciously decided to do this despite leaving (mind you I‚Äôm too dumb to calculate a $ amount but by all means, feel free fellow wrinkled brains) a CONSIDERABLE amount of money on the table.  Now why the fuck would someone as smart as he clearly is - see a million bucks or more on the ground and not pick it up?</p>
<p>Maybe it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a bigger picture we‚Äôre not seeing, that he is.  Maybe the opportunity for another nuclear gamma squeeze presents itself before 4/16 expiration - and he can exercise these call options at the most critical moment to exert maximum impact.  In video game terms: these call options are his special.  Super.  Ult.  Maybe even Fatality.  </p>
<p>But also maybe these could represent a revive spell.  Elixir.  Phoenix dust, if things take another wild turn for the worst.</p>
<p>Exercising and getting those shares demanded for delivery at a time of ultimate inconvenience of the market makers &amp; shorts is a 1-2 punch.  Not only does this put mm‚Äôs on the hook for delivering the shares (obviously) which is impactful, however small in the big picture - but maybe even more importantly it serves to act as inspiration to those who get inspired by his yolo updates.  If you don‚Äôt think him posting an update that shows he bought another 50,000 shares won‚Äôt be impactful, you‚Äôre living under a rock.  </p>
<p>Tldr; I believe he may have chosen to hold these calls in order to use either use them to help push a rally over the top - or as a defensive special power like a baptiste immortality field to spark a reversal should things start going south.   He is doing this purposefully, despite significant monetary loss, and he really fucking wants the world to know it.  </p>
<p>This is not investment advice, i eat crayons etc etc - but I feel it is important to open up a dialogue about the clues he has offered up, and what they alone might tell us about his motivations, and convictions in just how much he likes this stock.</p>
<p>PS- dfv if you‚Äôre reading this, I feel so bad for you buddy.  With this whole ordeal literally rewriting history, this must easily be the most exciting thing to happen (or one of, I dont know if you have kids) in your entire life by playing a role in it.  Seeing your vision of there being deep value in Gamestop play out to be true, against all likelihood, against those who doubted and ridiculed you, and against the wishes of extremely powerful forces who once stood to materially benefit immensely - has got to be totally surreal.  By simply identifying a really solid investment opportunity - you have whether intentionally or not - done more to bring the whole world together - people of all walks of life, during a moment in time the world couldnt be more divided and contentous.  I can‚Äôt understate how incredible this is to witness.  However, not being able to talk about it as a result of the law suit, and deservingly pound your fuckin chest like the stud silverback you are - has got to be torturous, with all you‚Äôre able to do is drop a yolo update here and there and giving out anonymous awards.  Just know that I see you bro.  We see you.  I really hope some day after books are written and statues sculpted in your honor - that I could buy you a pint and share a laugh on andromeda.</p>
