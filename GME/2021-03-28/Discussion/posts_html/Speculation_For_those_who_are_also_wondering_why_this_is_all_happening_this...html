<p>This is not investing advice, it's not even a prediction. I had a few drinks last night and was trying to give myself confirmation bias to hold (don't try this at home kids).</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>I'm a software engineer and we often have the task of coming up with objectives and key results that prove we are making progress in our work. Often we use past performance combined with where we think we are in our growth cycle to determine what outcomes (KR;key results)  that would best describe success. Often we describe KRs as an objective metric - something like 5% more weekly active users, or X number of users that do Y. I'm guessing Gabe and friends had pretty aggressive KRs this year because of the potential fallout of COVID - do or die.</p>
<p>Throughout my career OKRs have been a useful tool to help us predict what we should see as success and be a guide on what projects we invest time in, ultimately determining how we achieve our goals. (FAST/GOOD/CHEAP; pick 2). We often pick fast/cheap and then come back to good (sorry users!).</p>
<p>One caveat: often in my career we have lost the forest for the trees - and optimize one objective which often is underwhelming or doesn't have the effect we thought. More on this later.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>I'm asleep, wtf are you saying?</strong></p>
<p>Ok the reason I'm regaling you all with this is because I believe that Finance works in the same way - they have OKRs and ultimately they use current metrics and time to provide a function of outcomes for the year. Why is this relevant? <strong>I believe that short sellers used this information (COVID-19) as a weapon to optimize their gains in 2021 and they did so without proper understanding of what they were shorting - looking only at how the numbers would affect their goals (losing the forest for the trees).</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Stay with me</strong></p>
<p>Now that we think that hedge funds are making up targets and big predictions in Q2 - we have to realize something unprecedented happened last year just before Q2 planning session kicked in, COVID-19. <strong>March 11 â€” WHO Declares COVID-19 a Pandemic. The stage is set.</strong> I believe that the hedge funds, especially a promising up-and-coming start like Gabe Plotkin, had huge goals for this year. He wanted to be the next Steven Cohen or Ken Griffin (who made his fortune by over-shorting stocks; accidentally I heard) and claim his throne with the rest of the big boys of wallstreet's old money. And he didn't want to have a huge set back from COVID-19; <strong>how might we do both?</strong></p>
<p><em>Also note that Gabe was a protege of Steve Cohen (old money member 1); You don't want your protege to fail let's remember this for later. Gabe even bought a sports team like Steve did.. go figure.</em></p>
<p>Gabe and the rest of the greedy gambit gamblers had the realization:</p>
<p>1)  We can finally exit the extended shorting of GME (which has been going on for years; Gabe admitted in the first senate hearing). Good; realize these gains (good/cheap). Shorting a stock that is already down on its luck, is cheap, and there's no real risk, despite technically infinite risk on the trade. This probably means they're already 100% of float in IMO.</p>
<p>2) We can maximize our gains by going yolo on the short position and finally plow GME into bankruptcy, allowing all the shorts to claim untaxed gains. Potentially 50% extra on my yearly performance in the worst economy ever? All-star status incoming! (good/cheap)</p>
<p>3) We can offset any losses this year from the pandemic longs with this risky (fast/cheap) play that will finally realize massive gains - in case the rest of our portfolio takes a shit. Effectively be the hedge for any long positions that might tank because of economic conditions.</p>
<p>They put these realizations into action (alright, maybe not OKRs but whatever). This looks like the reasoning of an engineering team to me: 2 good/cheap rationale and 1 fast/cheap rationale that might not be so good. Checks out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>1 year later, the plan is completely fucked.</strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>What might have happened?</strong></p>
<p>Steve and the boys of old money have been long-shorting companies for 30 years. Gabe the protege knows about this gambit and through Melvin capital got the go ahead to joint he old money boys by running his own hedge fund. He bought into the short racket with the rest of them, but remember Gabe's capital is peanuts compared to Point72 and  their ilk; this will come later. <strong>I expect at this point Gabe and the other shorts are a 100-300% deep</strong> oversold in GME because they expected bankruptcy due to COVID-19. They are waiting for the biggest pay day of the year, and maybe career. Stardom come.</p>
<p>Politics comes into play; I won't discuss that rathole but end of the day politicians placate the people with just enough (much needed) money. The youths (and their parents) are bored as fuck at home and might be jobless. They turn to the industry that has helped them (and me) through many tought times where escapism is required. <strong>Gaming</strong>. Oops - old out of touch money forgot what kind of forest they shorted.</p>
<p>How did the hedge funds miss out that the company they are yolo shorting is the kind of company that helps poor people cope with the world being fucked up? <strong>Well, back to those OKRS - often in my career they also help us miss the forest for the trees</strong>. Happens to the best of us Gabe.</p>
<p>Enter DFV: I wont' say more because he saw this before any of us. It's probably why he likes the stock so much.</p>
<p>Enter Ryan Fucking Cohen: Also not much to be said here (p.s. Take me to tendietown pleas &lt;3).</p>
<p><strong>January 2021</strong></p>
<p>DTCC and other brokers for Melvin's capital (remember it's tiny in comparison) are suspicious of the short play that they bought into. In fact, they probably threaten to margin call Melvin because they are aggressively trading short positions and the bank of the stock market (DTCC) doesn't like to feel like they're about to lose big % on some n00bs trade. Threaten him with a margin call. See January 28th stock run-up and subsequent halt on purchasing of retailers; and the first time I experienced outright criminal manipulation in my portfolio. They turn off the taps - and Gabe puts his tail between his legs and begs for help.</p>
<p><strong>Who's backing Melvin?</strong></p>
<p>Gabe goes back to poppa Steve (his former mentor) and asks for help. In 2019 33% of all gains in Point72 came from Melvin capital. Evil cohen taps another old-money friend who's also deep in the short game to help his former protege <strong>and save his future tendies</strong>. (This sounds like Evil Cohen told Gabe the infinite money glitch for a percent of the cut and funding for the risk). See 2013 insider trading blow-up involving SAC and both these losers.</p>
<p>Poppa Steve taps Citadel the other known short seller and general old money devil for a bailout. Combined they both provide the cover for Melvin in exchange for more future tendies. They start pumping the FUD machine as they have done for years in the past; this is now old money doing what they do best. Shaking the shit out of the retail investor tree. Who knows what kind of deal they struck, but it wasn't <em>not</em> desperate.</p>
<p><strong>But we evolved into apes - apes hold trees good.</strong></p>
<p>At this point the big old boys who are shorting pros expect retail to fold with tails between their legs, just like always. Coughing up shares at fractions of the cost, letting the shorts slowly unwind the short position onto other funds while making a handsome profit. This is literally Ken Griffin's way. There have been a plethora of posts here that describe the various tactics. We see Shill Cramer and ShillBC, MotleyShill and MarketShill; but I digress.</p>
<p>We didn't sell - in fact, they gave retail the the fire sale of a lifetime and they did the opposite of sell they bought more. So now I expect that the combined hedges are 300-600% (or more, see other DD's on the sub). It is now in code fucking red. No one is getting out of this without a scar. </p>
<p><strong>DTCC and SEC snorlax prodded into action</strong></p>
<p>Now fully aware of taking potentially unlimited losses from Citadel and other shorters, the SEC and DTCC are actually doing something to save their own ass. See 801 and the other proposals they're trying to get in before the GME shareholders meeting in June.</p>
<p><strong>DTCC now wants to know everyone's position every fucking day</strong> until they can find a way to deleverage this absolute shit position onto some one else. They are desperate to unload this bullshit bag they're holding. What do they do? Make it seem like the shorts are going to win, and tank the cost-to-borrow. Notice how available borrowing shares are plummeting but the interest rate is still low? <strong>This is not how free market works</strong>. They are most likely stalling trying to unload bags to prevent them from getting crushed from these absolutely shit short positions.</p>
<p><strong>It's now almost April 2021</strong></p>
<p>Apes bought the fire sale, and now we own the 300-500%  range the shorts tried to use to shake us out of our tree. Maybe less because we are struggling with lockdown and many of us are paperhands. </p>
<p>Old money is now stalling for time as they scalp money on options while they figure out what the hell to do with the massive bags <strong>they</strong> hold.</p>
<p>This forest of fucking apes is holding on and ready to eat all the bananas.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> </p>
<p>This entirely speculation: Gabe wants to be like Steve. Gabe lost the forest for the trees - got greedy shorting an up-and-coming market to try to capitalize on the pandemic. Steve asks Ken to bail out his protege and save future tendies. Ken shakes tree, apes grab falling bananas. Apes smiling in tree with bananas waving at Ken. </p>
<p>Oh and when you write OKRs; think big picture - don't lose the forest for the trees or you will pay for it. Just like me, and now Gabe.</p>
<p>Wow my brain is now as smooth as the glass holding my afternoon tequila. Downvote me I'm probably wrong.</p>
