Gather round, all my fellow autists, and let me tell you the incredible story of Herbert Sukenik, one of the greatest diamond hands of all time. 

There have been plenty of articles written about Mr. Sukenik I'm not going to waste brainpower rewriting them. Most of what you read here will be copypasta. I think by the end you will understand how this story applies to us. Just in case your brain is still too smooth, I will spell it out for you at the bottom. Enjoy. 

New York City real estate has always been a land of extremes. Recently, a penthouse apartment with five floors listed for $98M, currently the highest priced residential condo for sale in the city. The Big Apple also holds the record for the highest priced sold home in the country, which closed earlier this year at $238M, more than two times the previous record (also, not surprisingly, in NYC). The city also holds the record for the most expensive eviction ever, at $17M — and the story behind it is amazing.

Learning to play in this high-stakes high-rise market can yield huge dividends. Some winners can attribute their success to learning over time. But in at least one case, winning was based on ***leveraging*** **time.** Such was the story, several years ago, that involved a big-time developer and a hermit (of sorts) living in a rent-controlled apartment. Herb Sukenik was the last holdout in a high-rise — in a one-room apartment atop the Mayflower Hotel. A developer bought the building with four elderly tenants still in place and had the legal responsibility of coming to terms with them for their “voluntary” departure. This was necessary in order to tear the building down and make way for the planned development of the swanky 15 Central Park West.

Herbert Sukenik was born in the Bronx, New York in 1930. He attended Cornell University where he earned an undergraduate degree in physics. He then stayed at Cornell to earn both a masters in physics and a Ph.D. By all accounts, Herb was brilliant. He was also a bit of a social outcast. He worked for General Electric for a while then at Martin Company in their Space Systems division. In 1974, Herbert, who had become somewhat of a recluse, rented a tiny 350 square foot apartment in the Mayflower Hotel building. He never married and seemingly had no friends or family. He basically lived like a hermit for the next three decades.

The Mayflower Hotel building sat on what was arguably the most valuable and highly coveted real estate in the world. Located at 15 Central Park West, the building was situated perfectly for someone to build luxury condos that would fetch tens of millions of dollars apiece. Possibly more. Seeing the obvious potential this property presented, in 2004 the entire building was purchased by real estate tycoons Arthur and Will Zeckendorf for **$401 million**.

The Zeckendorf brothers quickly began the process of paying off each one of the current tenants to move. Many of the early tenants accepted the first offer: **$650,000**. That left just a few holdouts. Those early birds should have held out longer because the move-out offer was raised to a mind boggling **$1 million**. All the remaining holdouts accepted, except one: **Herb Sukenik**.

Flabbergasted and unwilling to be held hostage, the Zeckendorfs began demolishing the building anyway. They hoped to drive Herb out from all the construction hassle and noise. Herbert was undeterred.

After living in a construction zone for over a year, Herbert's stubbornness finally paid off in 2005. Admitting defeat, the Zeckendorfs caved and made an offer Herbert could not (and did not) refuse. In order to finally get Herbert to leave his decrepit 350 square foot apartment, they offered him a one time cash buyout of… get ready for it… **$17 million**. That is by far the most money ever paid to get a single tenant to leave a New York City apartment. It's probably the most money ever paid to get anyone to leave any apartment. But it gets better. Not only did the Zeckendorfs agree to give Herb Sukenik $17 million cash, they also agreed to let him live in a **$2 million** apartment on Central Park South where he will pay **$1 a month** in rent for the rest of his life.

The end.

So class, what did we learn from Mr. Sukenik? How did he get these very powerful developers to bend to his will? He leveraged TIME. We are all in a very similar situation. Our only position of power is TIME and as long as we continue to diamond, eventually, someone is going to have to buy us out. They have been attempting to make us feel like there is a sense of urgency to this stock like it might all come crashing down to zero but we all know now that is never going to happen. The sense of urgency is gone. Now all that is left is time. We all have been living the way we are currently living, most of us, for a long long time. I think we don't mind waiting a few more months or even maybe a couple of years to be paid off? We know they are stuck. They have to settle their debts eventually. We are all theta gang now. Every day that goes by is another dollar they owe. tic, tic, tic.
