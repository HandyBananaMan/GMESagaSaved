Obviously not financial advice. We've seen a lot of good deeds in this subreddit and WSB, donating to preserve endangered species, helping each other and the environment. For the first time in many years I am hopeful for what's coming to the world, I really believe apes will use the money in a positive way. This is a once in a lifetime oportunity to change the world! I love you apes. Diamond hands ðŸ™ŒðŸ’Ž
