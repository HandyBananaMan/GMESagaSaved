Happy Sunday everyone,

I am Rensole, and I spilled coffee all over my crotch

So I've been asked a few times now to do a weekly round up so we can try and keep this a little better documented and you don't have to go over 5 different threads to get an idea of what has happened.

I'd also like to thank anyone and everyone who has helped make these possible.

I'd also like to thank everyone for messaging me, but I'm receiving 100s of DM's a day so if I miss anyone I'm sorry. also in the weekends I'm not on Reddit a lot as I'm currently self employed and have to juggle doing these DD posts with work ( and 15 hour workdays can get exhausting).

with these weekly's I'm also trying to slim it down a bit, making it easier to look back at the important things. it can also be that some of the info (% and numbers) can be outdated, but I'm sure the awesome members in this sub will point that out, so please give me some leniency when it comes to this.

Also this will have less pictures in it because there is a max of 20 images per post.

**Also at the end are some new thoughts, please read through to the end.**

Now onto the week.

# The hearing Redux.

In the hearing we heard a lot, mostly how thankful Vlad can be, but also that Citadel and Melvin closed their positions on GME. In the days after the hearing it became evident due to the more astute retards on these boards that this was complete bullshit. I've been getting a lot DM's about this so let me address it here. See GME as apples, they bought apples, so normally in their books they should have apples written in right? But now they made fruit baskets, even though they just have the apples. But now instead of apples the books show fruit baskets. This is called creative bookkeeping or "cooking the books"

Even though they still are short GME it just shows up differently, but at the end of the day nothing has changed. well except public perception perhaps.

📷Robbing the Hood

So remember how Vlad said he was "forced" to close trading by the DTCC?

Seems like Vladdy has been a naughty boy, he said that he was "Forced" to do so because he couldn't make the capital requirements. But a lot of people started questioning this from the get go, as we all thought there was more at hand, or at least more in the line of Collusion between the Hf's and Robinhood.

As the recent letter from the DTCC states

&#x200B;

So this was fixed before market open, so why where we not allowed to trade ?

seems like vladdy has some explaining to do.

# What the fuck is an exit strategy?

So as the some may have seen we have had some weird posts in the past weeks, from full out "false flag" operations (shills) to "Oh wE NeEd tO cLo$e AboVE 40".The next one would most likely be "oh when we reach X amount we need to sell" or some shit like that.

Guys honestly relax, by the current estimates we are squeezing them so hard by the balls it's not just hurting them but any future grand children are going to feel this squeeze 40 years down the line.

1k is not a goal, it's a checkpoint, these guys need to buy the shares between 200 and 300% (as they have shorted it so much. and this is nothing more than supply and demand.

**We OWN the Supply, they have the demand for the stock.**

so WE set the price. and in doing so, 10k a stock is no longer a meme. As stated before in many threads they where greedy and messed up, now it's ok for the normal guy to be greedy for one.

Good examples are exotic cars, while not all that special except for the brand name, a few brands own the complete market, thereby they are setting the price. If they would set it by quality of car or building costs we would have these cars at normal prices, but instead of that they OWN the market. Thus they set the price and we can't do shit about it.

Same go's for Melvin Citadel and the others.

They need our Banana Lambo's, we set the price.

&#x200B;

# Important Dates

Now before we move to this one please note this is both important to know and not to get your hopes up. they can and most likely will try to kick the can down the road.

As some of you may have noticed the XRT ETF is now the target of shorting instead of only just GME. This is bad right?

**!!!NOPE!!!**

I see this as an absolute win!. You know why? Because the GME stock doesn't give dividends, you know which one DOES give Dividends? You guessed it XRT!

Now in laymen terms, with GME they would've just need to cover the interest rate of the borrowed stock. But with XRT it's the interest AND the Dividends plus an interest on the dividends. So this will cost them more money than if they just stuck with GME.

XRT releases dividends every 3 months. Last one was December 20th ,2020.Estimated next payout is around mid March. **(addendum we found out it would be around the 19th of march)**

By all conservative estimates they have to cover before this or they will take same heavy losses.What is also noteworthy is that XRT has 18k volume on 80$ Puts for 3/19. The volume for 3/26 80$ puts is 142. GameStop has thousands and thousands of 800$ calls for? 3/19.

this in combination with the earnings report coming out between the 20/25th this could be a date to keep an eye on. Because someone is expecting that the economy will totally crash, SPY XRT and GME.

And again you may think this is just conjecture and you'd be right.

But I'm dumb enough to know I don't know everything, and smart enough to listen to people who do.

Tuesday

**Covering shorts**

So this is something I've seen posted a lot since last week but received a lot of dm's regarding the shorts.

Now how do shorts work? well that's easy they borrow (NOT BUY) a stock from a buddy of theirs, sell it for a 100 and think it will go down, so they buy the stock back at 90 and return the stock, making 10 bucks in the process.

but every day they borrow it they need to pay a % of interest on the borrowed stock, so the guy lending out the stock makes a little bit as well.Sounds simple and innocent right? but instead of taking the 10 bucks these guys thought, lets bankrupt the company, meaning they wouldn't need to return the stock and keep the 100 bucks.

That's the situation we find ourselves in right now. The difference is they borrowed the stock below the 30 bucks mark, meaning if they buy back now they are out of a lot of money.

Now how does that overlap from GME to XRT?

Good question and I appreciate the opportunity to address that here!

GME is an banana, XRT is a fruit basket.

The fruit basket has multiple items in it but also the GME bananas.

They know we based our information on the Short info we got from the stock, so they told the SEC "Nah bro we don't own the bananas, we owe them part of our fruit basket

"This is semantics, as the part of the fruit basket they own, IS STILL THE GME BANANAS.

But this keeps the GME BANANAS off the books, thinking that would change how we looked at the stock and hoping we would figure "shit the Squeeze has been Squoze" But we found out, and we are not the wolves of wallstreet, we are the Sharks of the web, and we smell the blood in the water.

some good explanation on why this is the Mother of all Squeezes can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lnxcio/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

**GME AND CHILL**

Instead of netflix and chill we now have our own guys creating a Deepfuckingvalue movie.We just have a trailer, and it looks AMAZINGThis was made by u/[thispersonedits](https://www.reddit.com/user/thispersonedits/) and it's one of the coolest things I've seen so far!

&#x200B;

**(no pictures of Wen moon anymore sorry guys, I've received several messages that people felt it may be racist, and some people of asian descent made it clear it made them feel uncomfortable and I want this community to be inclusive for all)**

&#x200B;

**When moon?**

I've been seeing (and been asked) this a lot, there is no date on our ticket guys.

**(addendum; yes even with everything posted about March 19th there is still no set date in my book, it's showing more likely that we will see something happen before the end of march, but nothing is ever set in stone with stocks)**

We know a few things for a fact.they need to cover at some point is a fact. Mark Cuban said "the lower the price the more power we as a group hold, as it becomes cheaper and cheaper to buy more and more". and guess what that fucker was right.

Yesterday **(2-22)** we saw the same ladder attacks we have been seeing for weeks, someone even bought 100.000 shares to short from god knows where, dropped them all to crash the priceAnd you know what happened? **THAT MOTHER FUCKER BOUNCED RIGHT BACK!!**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gxx9usdoy7k61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=536bd549147790091dfe30e3683318ac7fe3a598

**EGO**

Now with all that going on, why isn't Melvin and Citadel letting it skyrocket? I mean they could make money all the way to the top just like us right? ride this motherfucker into the moon?

See this is where the problem is, it's not about money for them anymore, it's about EGO, they wont be able to live with themselves if they got beat by "dumb money".

All in all that's literally it, nothing more, nothing less.

just figure the guy who got more than 1.8 billion in 2020, Yes Kenny 2020 was really hard for all of us...and imagine him being at a next social party, and he is normally a big shot, suddenly he is a nobody because we have pegged him so hard with our dumb money, no one is ever going to take him seriously anymore.

**What if Melvin or Citadel go's bankrupt?**

Doesn't matter, watch the big short. you should've seen this movie a few times by now.

Someone will **ALWAYS** be stuck with the bill, be it the brokers, the clearing houses or the government. Someone will pay and we will get our tendies.

Just so everyone knows FINRA short interest reports will be coming out TOMORROW! This will be a good point for us to tell how much they have shorted on GME and XRT. (or maybe other ETFS that have GME).

**(addendum; this will be referenced later)**

**So now what?**

First of all I'd like to say that's a great question and I'm happy to address them here and now, when I was a young boy in Bulgaria we where looking at the charts and we could always see that at 10AM the idiots start to short ladder and the price drops.

This is like going to get some water at the cooler and that annoying idiot from accounting is there. We know it's going to happen, we know he's going to be there, just try to be nice and keep on going.

same go's with the shares, but before going on let me state **WE DO NOT MAKE PRICE AGREEMENTS and under no circumstances do we agree on buy/sell days dates or times**.

But here is what I think, 100 bucks is ground floor with the new board, in the past weeks they have already expanded their business from just consoles to also include PC and things that revolve around pc's (mouse keyboards graphics cards you name it). this adds an entire new group.

we will get the q4 earning report next month. **(as far as I'm aware this will be on march 25th)**

So lets compare this to an actual video game, The Witcher 3.

WTF why? because there is a story that we know, and cd project red is known for giving free updates, and free dlc.

by my estimates 1K is still just checkpoint

And by no means the end, but wtf do I know I eat crayons and lego's.

Wednesday

**CFO GTFO**

Yesterday GameStop announced that Jim Bell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will be resigning from his roles on March 26, 2021. And they're looking to replace him from either inside hire or outside hire, if no one will be found on the outside they're most likely to hire Diana Jajeh, who is currently Senior Vice President .

So I've seen some people post "THIS IS BAD" nah I see this as an absolute win.This person is one of the few on the board that I had some serious doubts about (along with the Autoparts CEO as he's to oldschool to be of help).

some info on why this may be good can be found here :

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqvg5q/dd\_is\_always\_in\_the\_comments\_why\_cfo\_jim\_bells/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqvg5q/dd_is_always_in_the_comments_why_cfo_jim_bells/)

The reason why this is also good is because due to a new CFO, shares can be recalled and counted.The most likely reason he has been let go of his current position is that he's just sitting on his ass and did nothing in the gamestop stock mania, meaning that appointing a new CFO will trigger a recall and recalculation of stocks, investigate wtf has been going on, actually do something about the madness that is the MM.Remember, Melvin and Citadel tried to kill this company and he didn't do anything, so lets just hope the new CFO will do a better job.

also to give you some idea on how bad he fucked up is summarized by Domo capital:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ho1kbq0sy7k61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=947b2bcd3759543294067f24a79c59eaa244c801

&#x200B;

**Jim Cramer**

So Cramer is going rant over rant on GME because he doesn't like it, just love how he got portrayed in Iron Man is no longer a gimmick but his actual persona.He's been going off on Twitter, why GME is removed from fundamentals, how it's just "Dumb money" and the people don't know shit.

Now Cramer has been put in his place a bit by Domo Captial.

Domo Capital by their own words on their website:

    DOMO Capital Management, LLC, founded in 2007 by Justin Dopierala and headquartered in Germantown, Wisconsin, is a Wisconsin Registered Investment Advisor.
    
    As of January 31, 2021 DOMO managed $27.896 million in assets.
    
    DOMO firmly believes that a concentrated portfolio, chosen via a repeatable discipline emphasizing undervalued and out of favor stocks with solid fundamentals, leads to superior risk adjusted returns over the long-term. Fundamental to success with this approach is an investors patience and long term orientation, as return patterns are often out of sync with broader market patterns.
    
    We are also concerned about return of capital, and might use a larger cash position and other techniques when overall market conditions appear troublesome.

&#x200B;

So by the looks of who they are, and they're going against the narrative along with their mission statement I think it's safe to say, we have this whale on our side (everyone with more than a million bucks is huge to me personally). And ryan Cohen even stated in November how Gamestop could surpass $1.000 USD, this is without any squeeze or something like that, Cohen most likely speculated that by fundamentals but I can't speak to Mr. Cohens reasoning or logic as I don't personally know him.

And I just love how my personal assessment of over a 100 usd per share is the norm is kind of confirmed here, I love confirmation bias in the morning <3

**Paperhands Portnoy "interviewed" Vlad.**

I have to be honest, normally I try to read and watch everything related to this to have a well formed opinion, but I couldn't muster the basic interest to watch Vlad in cuck training again. it's 40 minutes and I'm sure he appreciates every question and is glad to address it here.\\

&#x200B;

**Finra data is skewed?**

Finra report is due today so expect that, also expect the shorts to be spread across multiple ETF's

[u/ThrowMoneyAway38](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowMoneyAway38/) posted this 6 days ago but I've only just found it, thanks buddy!

his own TLDR:

Fintel has been using numbers for total volume covering many exchanges, but only reports short volume from a subset of those exchanges, which makes short % look smaller. In the past two weeks, there there were very few (if any) shares on the market that weren't short. That being said, shorters maybe able to juggle for a while.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lm7840/what\_can\_we\_expect\_from\_the\_feb\_17\_short\_interest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lm7840/what_can_we_expect_from_the_feb_17_short_interest/)

So this means what?

It means it gave me a huge confirmation bias boner, we have been saying that the Finra models may look off, as in they're there but... everyone seemed to come up with another number.

So what to expect? well that one is easy, they have to report the numbers by the law right? BUT it's not how they report it that's the problem its WHERE they do.

And I can hear you say "but Rensole, you're so retarded for even saying that" and you're right, but not because of this, just in general.

When we found out by XRT I said to people check it out if this is possible in other ETF's, and we are right. the amazingly wrinkle brained [u/ResponsibleGunOwners](https://www.reddit.com/user/ResponsibleGunOwners/) found loads of ETF's with GME

I'm not going to summarize it as you should read it in it's entirety

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lr33yp/etfs\_containing\_gme\_average\_daily\_short\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lr33yp/etfs_containing_gme_average_daily_short_volume/)

Also some dude posted this on twitter:

**Volumes**

So if you remember correctly I posted about volumes , and saying how lower volume would benefit us (Tldr the less volume they have to fuck around with the less space they have to do fuckery).

and guess what, yesterday's volume is even lower at only 36% of the day before.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5iltf7myy7k61.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1a12b2aa56fbffc979cae2b773d94460dea6b5

Melvin and Griffin might have missed the note that size does matter.

Does that mean the squeeze is here?

no it means we are moving steadily towards it, dont put a set date on it, it happens when it happens.

Also once this is over we wont have squeezed Melvin and Citadel, this is more an autoerotic chokehold we'll have them in... don't kink shame me Sharon.

&#x200B;

The most important take away from this all is simple.Inadequate CFO got fired, melvin is backed into a hole, and things are looking good. we are fueling our nice little rocket for all the retards, and most importantly Melvin and citadel are kind enough they keep adding and make the moon nice and big for us.

&#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short interest

&#x200B;

Just like most women when dating me, lets talk about the short interest.

As Finra reports [here](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0) the current SI is 60% on GME itself.

Now here is where the trickery sets in, we know for fact that 60% is still huge right? I mean the VW squeeze in 2008 was only 18% so this is a lot more, but none the less 60% is a lot less than I expected.

And guess what... I can't find any data on the SI on the ETF's, and there are 63 ETFs that have GME in it.

So I've received some messages about people worrying, and I only have one answer to that.

DONT!

We knew some fuckery would happen, so this was most likely part of their plan, make info hard to get and go from there, so I'm actually ok with it because I'm sure there is a smart Ape in here that does know how to how to check ETF SI and I'll include it here.

Right now the minimum is 60% this means it can be a lot bigger!

Edit before posting:

one of our smart apes [u/nov81](https://www.reddit.com/user/nov81/) posted these numbers and they sound credible, New SI: 60.35 % Old SI: 78.46% Float: 69.75 mil

Institutional ownership is currently at 156.76%:

you can check out his thread explaining this in a little bit more detail and his sources [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls25hz/this_was_instantly_removed_on_wsb_dont_know_why/)

Also XRT IS SHORTED AT 193.65%

**The CFO stepping down.**

Now I posted about this guy yesterday as well so why the hell would I mention him once more?I appreciate the question, and I'm thankful to answer that question here.

This guy was not a little boy from Bulgaria but he is a literal crayon eating moron.

Yesterday I hypothesized that him getting fired may be a good thing, he didn't adapt in the slightest in the past years, failed to rebuy stocks and basically I'm amazed this idiot came as far as he has.

It seems that this man is totally inept, and the more I read the more I come to believe he hasn't resigned but was pushed out of his role.

because guess what ?

This idiot used to have a position at "Coldwater creek" $CWTR after the crash of 2008 the company wasn't in a good position as it sells expensive adult female (40+) clothes, and guess what in a huge ass recession that aint a smart play. and this idiot didn't do anything a CFO needed to do in the next 4 years which lead to the company being sold off and rebranded and he got a fat severance cheque to go along with it.

    From 2009 to July 2012 ColdWater did nothing but see RED and losing money, 
    business was tanking due to "poor management". 
    In 2012 Coldwater had to borrow $65million from Golden Gate Capital.
     
    GGC is a private equity firm run by a guy named David Dominik.
    The deal was assisted by a recovering Hedge Fund company at the time 'Citadel LLC' Oh and guess who graduated from Harvard with David Dominik? 
    Kenneth Griffin aka Citadel hedgie

Now isn't that interesting?

Then this moron moved to PF CHANGS from 2016 to 2019 and again did the same thing, ran it into the ground and the entire company got sold off for 700 million in total, giving the board a nice little cheque as a severance. And this seems his usual MO, I'm sure if we look at the companies Mr. Bell (end) has worked for we can find some Citadel links with shorting or something, the later part is purely speculative but I'm sure we'll find a lot.

And after that he moved onto GameStop, and GME started another death spiral like PF Changs and CWTR did, only our boy Cohen stepped in.

Now why is this so important? got resolved right?

Nope, this may be the beginning of a big change, as this nimrod couldn't get on board with Cohens new vision of digitalizing the market and moving in a new direction. he was supposed to step down next month but it seems he is no longer on active duty and according to LinkedIn Jajeh has already stepped up in the position to safeguard the companies future.

&#x200B;

he was also brought on board by the current CEO George Sherman, the same guy who ran the Autoparts store, home depot and Target in the mid 90's. a man who is so old-school he wouldn't know a digitalization from a Texas instruments calculator.

So this could be one of the first signs of Cohen making a move to becoming the new CEO.

WTF IT WENT FROM $170 to 100?!?🐒!!!

Lets start with something basic as this will be applicable throughout everything you guys will see through this.

“Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight." -Tendieman Sun Tzu

for the people thinking WTF is he talking about, relax I often ask myself that as well.

But this is a quote from "the art of war" and it's something that has been used for business, war and everything else they can use it for.

We are hurting the hedge funds a lot, and you may think to yourself.... "are we?"

YES! I've seen a post yesterday from Orthex stating that on Wednesday alone we where costing them 800+ million a day.

&#x200B;

with losses so big would you not try everything to stop this? that's what we've seen yesterday. they bought a fuckload of Short options, this affects the underlying stock and artificially drops the price. Then they can sell all those borrowed shorts and the price drops even more.

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) You can see they borrowed 1 million more shares in a span of hours.

users have also made full threads explaining this and doing amazingly well

(can't seem to find the image of Orthex stating it so if someone could perhaps give me a link I'll upload the image here)

Ok makes sense right?

Ok then let's go onto a little bit more technical aspects. By conventional calculations WE the retailers hold somewhere between 20% and 30% of GME's total stock.

Gme total available stocks are **69.747M**

in the past weeks the volume has been dying down slowly, and we can see that in the charts that have been posted before, ending with 24 Feb, with the volume at about 6/7 million.Then yesterday we suddenly had 150,308,703 of volume, that's 2312,44% more volume in one day.

This is fuckery and it's to be expected.

Again read the quote, we are bankrupting these assholes by simply buying the dips and holding.

so expect them to try everything to get out of the hole they dug for themselves!

And if you see people posting "**OH NO ITS OVER NOW!@!#$"**

They're either new to this and don't know how this works, Idiots, trolls or shills.

# We have been in the RED for WEEKS! let that sink in, WEEKS some of us maybe even longer than that! Remember we where only at $40 2 days ago, and then we shot up to 190 and back to 108 and at the time of writing in premarket we are at $123.THAT IS A 300% of the original price from early in the week!

Think about it, this stock is a rollercoaster, but no matter what happens we are up over a 100% in less than a day! and that's rare with normal stocks, but this motherfucker will go up even more.

# SEC, 3 words middle is Elon

Also [u/Ren3666](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ren3666/) has earned an extra wrinkle in his noggin.

On the 25th of Feb the SEC has reduces the fees for Security transactions from $22.10 to $5.10 effective immediately.

how this affects everything is simple, this is a good hint that there will be a huge sell off of securities so that HF's can sell them to recoup losses from what they will lose and have lost with GameStonk right now.

go read his entire writeup right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lshpuj/25th_feb_breaking_news_sec_reduces_fee_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

He explains it very well

# Statistical calculations.

Big brain [u/Fenrir324](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fenrir324/) has made a great synopsis of how the statistics calculation works.

this is his work:

    Basically what I was saying is that limit based calculus tells us that 
    "Though infinite, it can be defined in relation to a single point." 
    Meaning that there will be a peak eventually, it'll happen, 🦍 want their 🍌.
    
    If I were to throw a dart at a wall and record the event, I could go back and review it. 
    I could review the distance it travelled in half the time it took to hit the board, then half the remaining time, then half of the remaining time after that, etc ad infinitum. 
    But I know that the dart hits the board eventually, so I can define the occurrence as a banded infinity.
    Sigma is a denotation to the probability bands of something happening within a banded infinity (which means we never see 100%), 1-Sigma is encompassing of about 37% of the total spread from the median, so roughly 74% of all points (iirc, I don't use 1 sigma very often).
    
    The AI that ran the test simulated a 2-Sigma clipping, so it accounts for around 47.5% of the total data banded from the median, so 95% of all the probabilities.
    
    That leaves us with a top end 2.5% margin of error that it didn't even bother calculating, on an equation that is parabolic in nature. 
    We can continue to explore that region by increasing our Sigma clipping and we'll never reach the end.
    Enter the limit based calculus, we know it has to end somewhere, so where do we define that location? 
    3-Sigma? 5? 20? The answer is that the peak is defined by huma- erm, 🦍 factors.
    We only hit the peak when apes decide enough 🍌 is enough 🍌 and start diddling themselves with the 🍌 that they made. 
    So the stronger the 🦍 greed, the higher the maximum uncapped value of the 🍌.
    Tl;dr: Hodl you beautiful 🦍 you. 🦍🤝💪💎🤲🚀🌕🍌🍌🍌
    Edit: 1-Sigma is a 34.1% spread of median

# WHO IS UP FOR SOME GOOD NEWS?

The fee for borrowing shares just shot up from 1% to 12.5%Meaning what we did in 2 days (costing them 1.6 billion) now takes an hour.

Still not financial advice!

# Has the Squeeze been Squoze?

So by this point we have all seen this tweet right?

while we have tried deciphering this as best we could with multiple theories I believe [u/tiptoeintotown](https://www.reddit.com/u/tiptoeintotown/) May have just cracked it.

To provide full transparency, we are both in a chatgroup and we sometimes bounce ideas off of each other in there and that's how this theory came to be.

Now the frog is considered as a figure of change, due to it's nature it starts as a tadpole and changes from fully aquatic to being an amphibian frog.

OR it can be reference to FROGGER.

Going up and down, it's a game after all.

&#x200B;

Now the letter M is usually seen as a sort of bounce or whatever, or the ice-cream resembles a rocket, but we think it's none of that.

Actually we think the story behind it is very simple, how many of you know the backstory of how McDonalds came to be?

The two brothers McDonald started the company but they wanted to keep it small but there was this one guy called Ray Kroc, he saw a lot of potential in it, he saw then what McDonalds could be right now. Something the brothers McDonald could not.

One of the main things was the ice cream machine, this thing was super expensive, but Ray found something around that. Powdered shakes. and I hear you thinking WTF does that have to do with GameStop? hold on it will be clear in a sec.

He actually stole it from the real McDonald’s brothers by using the leverage he gained off on switching over to the ice cream tasty freeze product that the brothers refused to use because it brought the integrity of the product down. Lowering the cost of the electricity to keep the burner ice cream cold by switching to Tastee Freez gave Roy the access capital he needed to signal through the brothers that he had the leverage now to buy the land that the restaurant sat on and then release the land out to the McDonald’s Corporation. That’s how he was able to spread across the United States and make the foothold that he did as quickly as he did. He completely cut the brothers out.

We think, that this Ice-cream may be a reference to that.

Cohen is moving up as CEO, just like Mr. Kroc did.

They both have a vision of the company that the previous owners did not.

and the funny thing, this is also a reference to Cohens former company Chewy, where one of two slides was his team, enjoying some Mcdonalds soft serve Ice-cream.

# Now the new thoughts.

&#x200B;

As we are ever closing in on the squeeze each and every day tempers can get hot, people will look for confirmation bias, and people will hype each other up.

As a Mod I feel responsible to make sure to tell everyone to cool it.

!Temper your expectations!

&#x200B;

The most important thing we need to keep in mind is that most of the people posting good DD is taking Facts and interpreting these to what they could mean or how it could fit in the overall story.

Most of these people (me included) are not professional traders, and all opinions and DD should always be double checked, this includes everything I ever post.

if you see something that sounds to good to be true, it usually is.

Even with everyone coming to a realization that something big will happen around the date of March 19th, this is just speculation in the end. and we should never take any DD as fact, just an opinion someone has formed around certain data the person has found.

There are a lot of things pointing to March 19th and March 25th, but there where also data like this found around February and January. so with any sort of prediction be cynical, check their data, look at the comments, sometimes a person can miss certain things or make leaps of faith.

This is due to something called the "hot hand" fallacy

The hot hand fallacy is simple, you can see this everywhere, a person made a correct bet and they think they're lucky, do this a few times and the person believes he isn't just lucky, they believe they are just "that good".

90% of predictions are never right, as a prediction is a 50/50 shot.

Either they're right or they're not.

This is not to discredit anyone on this sub, everyone has been trying to make sense of this hot mess that the Hedgies have created. but I believe we are at a point that the Hedgies don't even know what is going on anymore.

So in short I'd like to say one last thing. Expect this to crash back into the red, maybe even back to 40 or bellow, these people have a lot to lose so they'll try to do anything to get out of this. but this does not mean it will remain red, at some point the squeeze will happen. And there are people who believe in the squeeze and there are people who don't.

Both opinions are valid, as long as they're backed by facts.

&#x200B;

One thing I would like to make a clear statement regarding "Hype" posts.

We wont be allowing any posts of the likes of "I will post my work tomorrow", these will get deleted from now on.

As the community has made it clear they do not like those sort of posts, and are viewed as "Karma farming" And from now on it's either You have DD and you post it, or you dont.

The only exception is if someone is making DD and needs help, you can always ask for help on this sub.

None of this is financial advice
