This isn’t over guys! They are taking out more short positions because they NEVER learn their lesson! 

GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: they haven’t closed their positions because they can’t! They can not afford to close it. They keep shorting to force the price lower so they can cover! But inevitably keep ending up digging themselves a bigger hole! ❤️❤️

There’s only 500,000 shares left to short. Hodl 💎🙌🏻🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: go look at Call options for 3/19 and look at the volume at the $800 strike price! 🚀🚀🚀 (10,054)
I’m feeling bullish!! 🚀🚀

Not financial advice I just love the stock! 🚀🚀🚀
