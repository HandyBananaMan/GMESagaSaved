Don\u2019t you guys ever forget that or I\u2019ll hire Liam Neeson to come and find you with my gains.\nEdit: This gained way more traction than I thought it would so I thought I better reiterate my point here. Don\u2019t be a twat with your money if you make a lot! That\u2019s all I\u2019m getting at here. \nUnfortunately I can\u2019t edit the title otherwise I\u2019d remove the 5k and 50k figures. I\u2019ve held my shares since the beginning of January and will continue to hold them till AFTER the peak. Where/ when is the peak? No one knows! But wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we all saw it together. \nNot financial advice, just doing what I personally think is right.",
    "title": "At 5k I can buy myself a house. At 50k I could buy a bigger house, instead I buy my 2 brothers and sister a house too. I pay their debts off, I secure my children\u2019s futures, I donate to charity. I help as many people as I can. People really call us dumb money?",
