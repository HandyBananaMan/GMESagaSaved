# Title: At 5k I can buy myself a house. At 50k I could buy a bigger house, instead I buy my 2 brothers and sister a house too. I pay their debts off, I secure my children’s futures, I donate to charity. I help as many people as I can. People really call us dumb money?

THIS is the way. Don’t you guys ever forget that or I’ll hire Liam Neeson to come and find you with my gains.
Edit: This gained way more traction than I thought it would so I thought I better reiterate my point here. Don’t be a twat with your money if you make a lot! That’s all I’m getting at here. 
Unfortunately I can’t edit the title otherwise I’d remove the 5k and 50k figures. I’ve held my shares since the beginning of January and will continue to hold them till AFTER the peak. Where/ when is the peak? No one knows! But wouldn’t it be cool if we all saw it together. 
Not financial advice, just doing what I personally think is right.
