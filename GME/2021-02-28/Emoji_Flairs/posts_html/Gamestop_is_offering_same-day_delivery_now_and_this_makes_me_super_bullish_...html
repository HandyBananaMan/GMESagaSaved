<h1>Title: Gamestop is offering same-day delivery now and this makes me super bullish even with any type of shorts. If they pull through and can compete with Amazon, we're talking about a minimum 20 billion company soon, and they got this up way quicker than I thought they would. This is amazing.</h1>
