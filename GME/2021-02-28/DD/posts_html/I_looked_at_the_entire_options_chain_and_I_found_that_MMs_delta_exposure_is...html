<p>Yesterday I published my findings of how many shares MMs need to own in order to be delta neutral. However, I only went to march 19th as I naively assumed that there was not enough open interest to significantly affect their exposure.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>Their exposure is over <strong>25 million shares.</strong></p>
<p>This can only mean two things: They own millions of shares AND calls, or they <strong>ARE NOT DELTA NEUTRAL.</strong></p>
<p>Market Makers MUST be delta neutral in their position, which means even at the low price of 101$, they must own massive amounts of shares and calls or they must purchase them. This implies that Market Makers are walking the tight line of causing a massive gamma squeeze the likes of which we have never seen, or <strong>half the float is locked up to hedge.</strong></p>
<p>If they use calls to hedge, they will dig their own grave as it will push the price higher as other market makers need to start covering massive amounts of ITM calls. <strong>This means that if they bought ITM calls to hedge, it will accelerate the gamma squeeze.</strong></p>
<p>So, what should they do? Do they <strong>buy 25m shares?</strong> or do they buy massive amounts of call options (we are talking in excess of 250k calls) and <strong>accelerate the gamma squeeze?</strong></p>
<p>I personally only see two outcomes, one as the stock rises it will become more and more volatile as shares get locked up to hedge, or we are the cusp of seeing a massive gamma squeeze. <strong>Both outcomes will exasperate the short squeeze.</strong>  </p>
