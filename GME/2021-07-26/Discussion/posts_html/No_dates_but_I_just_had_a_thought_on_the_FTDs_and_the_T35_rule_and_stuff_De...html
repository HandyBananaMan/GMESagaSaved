<h1>Title: No dates, but I just had a thought on the FTD's and the T+35 rule, and stuff Dentistft wrote about. If my math is right, then July 27th is the due date for FTDs in GME shares and the ETFs that hold GME, and they would be massive.</h1>

<p>UPDATE: well this was completely useless, unless like me someone also purchased the discounted prices today. But in any case, i will continue doing what i have done everyday, to try and take over my world by holding and buying dips when pay day. </p>

<p>TLDR: the 6/18 and 6/21  T+35 dates got STACKED on for 7/27 because of the June 19 and July 4th holidays.</p>
<p>I did message u/dentisttft in case he can quickly correct me if i'm wrong, but not sure he will see it.</p>
<p>From the DD i read MMs get T+6 to get to the FTD date, and then T+35 to get to the FTD Due date.</p>
<p>If I have correctly stated those rules, then on June 10th we had massive shorting.For regular entities shorting on 6/10 it would be T+2 =  June 14th (for regular shorts), which coincidentally had large amount of FTD of 105,712 shares.For MM's shorting on 6/10 that means T+6 = June 18th for their FTD date, which has a massive amount of GME share FTD of 462,852 shares.</p>
<p>I remember reading that when they short the Shares of GME past -10% and we hit the SSR, then they switch over to shorting large amounts of ETFs for the next day.</p>
<p>So considering this, on June 11th the Shorting of the GME commenced via ETFs, which i believe would be mainly done by AP's and i think those are including MM's .</p>
<p>Shorting ETFs on June 11th and T+6  would make the FTD dates = June 21. Coincidentally June 21 ETF FTD is massive at 2,344,838.</p>
<p>COMPARE the June 21 ETF FTD of 2,344,838 to the GME Share FTD of 13,632  on June 21. So that makes sense to me, they short shares on 6/10th, and short the ETFs on 6/11th.(also i couldnt find data on the June 15th share FTDs ( that would be June 11 plus T+2))</p>
<p>NOW IS THE FUNNY PART.</p>
<p>FTD's from June 18th and FTDs from June 21st, all Fall onto July 27th.  T+35 just means 5 weeks later, excluding the holidays. Yea, that's right, Juneteenth was a holiday on the 19th, and July 4th was a holiday. The June 18th FTDs included 2 holidays for T+35, and June 21st only includes 1 holiday.</p>
<p>So both FTDs on June 18th and June 21st  plus T+35 = July 27th. That's Tuesday.</p>
<p>I really hope that this T+35 rule lines up, because the T+6 seems to line up with the dates. The T+2 lines up as well (except the missing june 15th...)</p>

<p>My source for the T+ rules was the DD shared by wrinkly apes, I cant specifically remember the exact posts. I hope someone knows.</p>
<p>And my date counting skills was used on a calendar. Honestly i really hope im doing the math right....</p>
<p>PS  no dates, this is purely for educational and perhaps entertainment purposes only, as i watch the ticker more than tv now.... I just want to find out how true the T+35 DD is by u/dentisttft.</p>
