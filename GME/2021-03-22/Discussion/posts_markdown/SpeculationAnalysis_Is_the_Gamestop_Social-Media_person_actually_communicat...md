People talked a lot about the Facebook post stating "It's gonna be a monster of a week.". I talked about two previous posts, making it look like the Social-Media person is talking about the Stock.

**I. Weekly Examples**

This could refer to the Earnings Report. Might be a lot more than people expected and therefore this will be a monster of a week.

What is funny is, they had a similiar message on Facebook last week as well. And is was a battle over the whole week. They obviously know something, that we can only speculate about.

**This is what the week looked like:**

**The Price went from $130 to $200 one day after the post. After that it went up to $350 over the course of the next days.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What is weird about this is, they only post the weekly ads with the "messages" on Facebook. They haven't been on Twitter yet. But the point of an ad is, to reach as many people as possible. So why are they not posting it on Twitter? (I actually don't know, this is a real question :D)

**II.** **More Examples that could be interpreted as talking about the Stock / Situation surrounding it with my interpretations:**

We're making it easier for you to catch 'em all sounds like they are planning something, that would force a cover of the shorts (catching them all doing illegal shit, catching them all red handed).

*20 % extra trade credit* towards that next *big game* when you bring in one of our *Most Wanted Trades*? This is a bit more obvious than the other ones. Buy the stock at a lower price right now, take credit towards that next "big game" (rise in price) and it's THE most wanted trade at the moment.

This one was posted 1 day after the price dropped from $350 to $170 and back up to $250 within a matter of minutes. *We're having a* PC *Sale it's a knockout*. *Get great deals* on all the PC games and gear *you need to stay in the fight*. So what I read out here was the marked words above. "We're having a Sale, it's a knockout. Get great deals to stay in the fight". Just a few hours after that huge price drop. Could be a coincidence, but we're a conspiracy theorists according to shills, so imma stick with that.

This was posted 2 min after market closing, when the stock was ate 265. What does "eating stocks" mean? [https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/e/eating-stock](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/e/eating-stock) \- Quote:  **Eating stock** occurs when a broker/dealer or market maker has to purchase stock because there are not enough buyers. There actually was a reddit post about that Tweet as well ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3uge2/meaning\_behind\_gamestop\_tweet/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3uge2/meaning_behind_gamestop_tweet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf))

TL;DR: About 10 Tweets/Facebook Posts talking about a final battle, staying in a fight and getting discounts on most wanted trades is a bit more than obvious. If you go back to days, weeks and months before that, they never talked about battles, fights, etc. that much. (Discounts of course, because they are a retailer). These were the ones I saved, maybe there are some more and I couldn't find them. But it looks like they know something big, that we can only speculate about at the moment, therefore urging us to stay patient.
