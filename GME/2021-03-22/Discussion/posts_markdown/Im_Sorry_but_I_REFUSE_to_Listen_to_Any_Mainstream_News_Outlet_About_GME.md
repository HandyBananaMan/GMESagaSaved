Or anything real for that matter..

Bloomberg? Full of shit. 

CNBC? Full of shit. 

Motley Fool? Full of shit. 

Forbes? Full of shit. 

FOX, The Washington or NY Post? Full of shit. 

Anyone who’s telling you that $GME is sunk is FULL of SHIT. 

The ONLY place I come to for Due Diligence is here. 

REDDIT. 

This place is the holy grail for learning. Not only about this saga but about the market and how it works in general. 

Here, I can trust people like me. I can see the sources being found and the information being discovered. I can see the dots being connected. I can infer for myself based on your beautiful research what to do or what will come next. 

There is no other place like this! 

Make no mistake, they see it too and are trying to target us now with their bans and their shills but stay strong and HODL the course! 

Ape Together STRONG. 🦍💪🏻💎🙌🚀🖍

This information is making us stronger! Get it here, where it counts. 

Don’t be a sheep, be an APE! 

I love you all, to the moon 🌙❤️
