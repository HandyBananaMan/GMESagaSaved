<p>This place is the holy grail for learning. Not only about this saga but about the market and how it works in general. </p>
<p>Here, I can trust people like me. I can see the sources being found and the information being discovered. I can see the dots being connected. I can infer for myself based on your beautiful research what to do or what will come next. </p>
