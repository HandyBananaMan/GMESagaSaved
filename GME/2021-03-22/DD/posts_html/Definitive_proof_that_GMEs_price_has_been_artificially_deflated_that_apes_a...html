<p>Hello my fellow Apes 🦍🦍🦍,</p>
<p>For anyone with any lingering doubts about GME price being getting manipulated prepare to have your 🦍🧠🤯.</p>
<p>I am going to show some fairly definitive proof, using a measure called <strong>'On-Balance Volume'</strong> which will show that all the downward price pressure has been with EXTREMELY minimal volumes.</p>
<p>You apes don't only have 💎✋ BUT ARE ALSO BUYING THE DIPS because total net buying volume has net INCRASED since January!</p>
<p>For me personally, this was the final piece of evidence I needed to feel certain about where this stock is going. 🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>---------- <strong>BOILERPLATE:</strong></p>
<p>I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Price drop from Jan 29 to Feb 4 was done with almost no net negative buying pressure (very low share volumes). Proof that 🦍 are💎✋ AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. 💎✋🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>---------- On Balance Volume (OBV)</strong></p>
<p>Before I 🤯 your mind, here is what <strong>OBV (On-Balance Volume)</strong> is all about:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator, adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Balance Volume (OBV) line is simply a running total of positive and negative volume. A period's volume is positive when the close is above the prior close and is negative when the close is below the prior close.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The absolute number of the OBV does not matter, what does is the relative height of the line over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices.</strong> <strong>Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices.</strong></p>
<p>This means, that if we see a significant decline in share price, we should also see a decrease in OBV line at a similar magnitude.</p>
<p>For my fellow 🤓, here is the equation:</p>

<p><strong>---------- Examples of share price following OBV</strong></p>
<p>Below I have 5 examples from other companies (AMD, Tesla, Cineplex, Royal Caribbean, Canopy) and all of them have OBV lines that very nicely go along with the share price.</p>
<p>Note: All data from TradingView (awesome app btw) and Period set to 1 day.</p>
<p><strong>This is what the relationship between OBV and price should look like.</strong> In fact, the whole purpose of the OBV is that it actually can show when a price is about to move in a certain direction as you can see the spikes in OBV are all 1 to 2 periods before the share spikes.</p>

<p><strong>---------- GME: When Share price doesn't follow OBV</strong></p>
<p>And now let's get to GME.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here you can see huge positive buy pressure from Jan 12 to 27, increasing by 462% with a share price increase of $305 (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp#:~:text=The%20volume%20weighted%20average%20price%20(VWAP)%20is%20a%20trading%20benchmark,and%20value%20of%20a%20security">VWAP - volume weighted average price</a>).</li>
<li>Then the share price dropped by $264 (80%) from January 29 to Feb 4. If this was a real drop (i.e. people were actually selling their shares), we would expect a relative decrease in the buying pressure, however we only see it go down by 9%! 🤣🤣</li>
<li>When GME spiked in February, it actually gained more total positive buying pressure and surpassed the previous high point set on January 27!</li>
<li>It has only gone higher since. <strong>On March 10 &amp; 12, we were at the highest level, 25% higher than January</strong> and even today, we are still 17% higher. This is also important because it showed that not much extra buy pressure was required to bring the price up from $40 to $300</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WILL GET TO PROOF OF 💎✋! Almost no one actually sold during this period, or we would have seen a huge increase in negative buy pressure.</strong> If you just looked at the OBV, you would think that the stock price should be around $450-500</p>
<p>The <strong>red line is what I think the OBV SHOULD look like for the current stock price.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: This observations is true if you set the period to 1 week, 1 day,  4 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours and 1 hour</strong></p>
<p>---------- <strong>TLDR</strong></p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Price drop from Jan 29 to Feb 4 was done with almost no net negative buying pressure (very low share volumes). Proof that 🦍 are💎✋ AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. 💎✋🚀🚀🚀</strong></p>
