<p>Great finish! Last minute buying spike helping us end around 194. Nothing too crazy, volume was still low. Good day overall! Still on schedule following the 172 diagonal.</p>

<p>Power hour kicked in, not much action yet. Volume hasn't really picked up.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 10 2:48PM:</strong></p>
<p>Still low volume, expect sideways for now until volume ramps up.</p>

<p>Volume still low. Nothing too interesting. Checkout my stream btw!</p>
<p><strong>Edit 6 2:16PM:</strong></p>
<p>Just to help you guys understand the state of the play, and to recap the stuff that got accidentally deleted, <strong>we are hugging the diagonal support for most of the day. Mostly trending sideways. Volume is extremely low.</strong></p>

<p>Reverting to the mean. Snapping across VWAP</p>

<p><strong>I will not be streaming again for a bit. Just need to take a break :D Takes a lot of time to set everything up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I got a test Tuesday so I may not do my daily post. Sorry, midterms week!</strong></p>
