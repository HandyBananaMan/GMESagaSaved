    "selftext": "Guten Tag my dear apes,\n\nmidterm exams are almost over and I have a little more time on my hand to play around with my Bloomberg terminal. As you all might know GameStop's earnings release is scheduled for **March 23 after market close**. Sign up here for the earnings conference call at **05:00 PM (EDT)**: [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1424794&tp\\_key=d5ec83cadf](https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1424794&tp_key=d5ec83cadf)\n\nI will not go into detail on how the earnings release can be a catalyst for a squeeze, I believe there is a lot of great DD out there on this topic.\n\nI had a quick look into the Bloomberg terminal to glance over current and historic earnings estimates and wanted to share this information with you. This is nothing extraordinary or new information that came to light but it's still interesting to look at and get a feeling of what we can expect tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Earnings & Estimates \\(EE\\)](https://preview.redd.it/sdg1ss7o7mo61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7802af682c85dfeebf9eb51a0e6eb57334484aad)\n\nI used the EE (Earnings & Estimates) function to pull up an overview of earnings history, consensus overview, and earnings trends. I am going to point out the most relevant figures:\n\nLet's start with looking at **4) Consensus Overview EEO**:\n\n* EPS, Adjusted: **1.433 with a YoY growth of 12.9%**\n   * EPS: **Earnings-per-share** is calculated as a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock.\n* Revenue: **2.209 Billion $ with a YoY growth of 0,7%**\n   * Revenue: Income generated from normal business operations (all sales).\n* Net Income, Adjusted: **101.06 Million $ with a YoY growth of 20.6%**\n   * Net income: **sales** minus cost of goods, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, depreciation, interest, taxes, and other expenses.\n\nYoY Growth: **Year-over-year** is the comparison of one period with the same period from the previous year.\n\n**This is a good sign. Analysts estimate that GameStop will outperform its last Q4 earnings report.**  Analysts also believe that GameStop's growth is **Stronger** than **Comparable Companies**. BUT: be aware, estimates are not always accurate and miss quite often.\n\nAnother interesting figure is the **Avg/Implied 1 Day Move of 13.28% / 14.08%.**\n\n* **Average 1 Day Move:** Average absolute percent change in share price 1 day after earnings for the past 8 periods.\n* **Implied 1 Day Move:** Absolute percent change in share price around the next earnings date estimated from option volatilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EPS estimate in detail](https://preview.redd.it/obx4ovzfamo61.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=847fbb6bdfcab249b3657d1eb02e9a4c3a073d04)\n\nIf we look closer into the **Earnings-per-share estimate** we see that the current consensus is built on 6 analyst estimates with a standard deviation of **0.366**. The highest EPS estimate is **1.830**, this would translate into a **YoY growth of +44%** and the lowest estimate is **0.840**, this would translate into a **YoY growth of** **-34%**.\n\n**Average surprise at report date: 14.27%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Revenue estimate in detail](https://preview.redd.it/e8w4jtchomo61.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe199c781f6d0b35e1348e10f8aacff5ad81ba1)\n\nIf we look closer into the **Revenue estimate** we see that the current consensus is built on 7 estimates with a standard deviation of 91.671 Million $. The highest Revenue estimate is **2.349 Billion $**, this would translate into a **YoY growth of +7%** and the lowest estimate is **2.085 Billion $**, this would translate into a **YoY growth of** **-5%**.\n\n**Average surprise at report date: 3.34%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Net income estimate in detail](https://preview.redd.it/mv54pfbdrmo61.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=2230b3167c476bc723329975decfe430e3307e65)\n\nIf we look closer into the **Net Income estimate** we see that the current consensus is built on 5 estimates with a standard deviation of 16.192 Million $. The highest Revenue estimate is **119 Million $**, this would translate into a **YoY growth of +42%** and the lowest estimate is **79.5 Million $**, this would translate into a **YoY growth of** **-5,5%**.\n\n**Average surprise at report date: 14.28%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GameStop Growth Estimates](https://preview.redd.it/mtg9ciaatmo61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6768af3b0ab5ee773d0ea2633753afa2a42ebe6b)\n\nHere are also some future estimates **for the next quarters** and they are looking quite good. The percentages you see are all **YoY Growth rates**.\n\nI hope this was somewhat interesting to look at and I will now be enjoying the overcooked food that I forgot in my oven. Auf Wiedersehen!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Analysts expect GameStop to outperform their last Q4 earnings. Earnings-per-share up 12.9%, Revenue up 0.7% and Net Income up 20.6%. Future estimates look promising.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*EDIT 1: To everyone asking about the reliability of those estimates:*\n\n*Analysts use sophisticated forecasting models, management guidance, and fundamental information on the company to derive future earnings.*\n\n*They are based on analysts' expectations of company growth and profitability. To predict earnings, analysts estimate prospective revenues and costs. They will incorporate top-down factors such as economic growth rates, currencies, and other macroeconomic factors that influence corporate growth.*\n\n*Those cashflow predictions are also essential in valuing companies using DCF models (Discounted Cash Flow) or trading multiples and are the foundation for equity research reports of big investment banks. BUT: estimates are still far from perfect and should only be used as orientation.*",
