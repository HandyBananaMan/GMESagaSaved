Hello my fellow Apes ü¶çü¶çü¶ç,

For anyone with any lingering doubts about GME price being getting manipulated prepare to have your ü¶çüß†ü§Ø.

I am going to show some fairly definitive proof, using a measure called **'On-Balance Volume'** which will show that all the downward price pressure has been with EXTREMELY minimal volumes.

You apes don't only have üíé‚úã BUT ARE ALSO BUYING THE DIPS because total net buying volume has net INCRASED since January!

For me personally, this was the final piece of evidence I needed to feel certain about where this stock is going. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

&#x200B;

\---------- **BOILERPLATE:**

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**TLDR: Price drop from Jan 29 to Feb 4 was done with almost no net negative buying pressure (very low share volumes). Proof that ü¶ç areüíé‚úã AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. üíé‚úãüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

&#x200B;

**---------- On Balance Volume (OBV)**

Before I ü§Ø your mind, here is what **OBV (On-Balance Volume)** is all about:

&#x200B;

>On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator, adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days.

On Balance Volume (OBV) line is simply a running total of positive and negative volume. A period's volume is positive when the close is above the prior close and is negative when the close is below the prior close.

>The absolute number of the OBV does not matter, what does is the relative height of the line over time.

**Rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices.** **Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices.**

This means, that if we see a significant decline in share price, we should also see a decrease in OBV line at a similar magnitude.

For my fellow ü§ì, here is the equation:

**---------- Examples of share price following OBV**

Below I have 5 examples from other companies (AMD, Tesla, Cineplex, Royal Caribbean, Canopy) and all of them have OBV lines that very nicely go along with the share price.

Note: All data from TradingView (awesome app btw) and Period set to 1 day.

**This is what the relationship between OBV and price should look like.** In fact, the whole purpose of the OBV is that it actually can show when a price is about to move in a certain direction as you can see the spikes in OBV are all 1 to 2 periods before the share spikes.

**---------- GME: When Share price doesn't follow OBV**

And now let's get to GME.

* Here you can see huge positive buy pressure from Jan 12 to 27, increasing by 462% with a share price increase of $305 ([VWAP - volume weighted average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp#:~:text=The%20volume%20weighted%20average%20price%20(VWAP)%20is%20a%20trading%20benchmark,and%20value%20of%20a%20security)).
* Then the share price dropped by $264 (80%) from January 29 to Feb 4. If this was a real drop (i.e. people were actually selling their shares), we would expect a relative decrease in the buying pressure, however we only see it go down by 9%! ü§£ü§£
* When GME spiked in February, it actually gained more total positive buying pressure and surpassed the previous high point set on January 27!
* It has only gone higher since. **On March 10 & 12, we were at the highest level, 25% higher than January** and even today, we are still 17% higher. This is also important because it showed that not much extra buy pressure was required to bring the price up from $40 to $300

**THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WILL GET TO PROOF OF üíé‚úã! Almost no one actually sold during this period, or we would have seen a huge increase in negative buy pressure.** If you just looked at the OBV, you would think that the stock price should be around $450-500

The **red line is what I think the OBV SHOULD look like for the current stock price.**

**Note: This observations is true if you set the period to 1 week, 1 day,  4 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours and 1 hour**

\---------- **TLDR**

**TLDR: Price drop from Jan 29 to Feb 4 was done with almost no net negative buying pressure (very low share volumes). Proof that ü¶ç areüíé‚úã AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. üíé‚úãüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

**Stake:** Shares in GME
