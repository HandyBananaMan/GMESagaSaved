# UPDATE, I WILL BE STREAMING WEEKLY ON MONDAYS. SAME TIME 9:15PM EST.

**Edit 13 4:00PM:**

Great finish! Last minute buying spike helping us end around 194. Nothing too crazy, volume was still low. Good day overall! Still on schedule following the 172 diagonal.

**Edit 11 3:18PM:**

Power hour kicked in, not much action yet. Volume hasn't really picked up.

**Edit 10 2:48PM:**

Still low volume, expect sideways for now until volume ramps up.

Volume still low. Nothing too interesting. Checkout my stream btw!

**Edit 6 2:16PM:**

Just to help you guys understand the state of the play, and to recap the stuff that got accidentally deleted, **we are hugging the diagonal support for most of the day. Mostly trending sideways. Volume is extremely low.**

**Edit 5 2:14PM:**

Reverting to the mean. Snapping across VWAP

**Edit 4:**

**I will not be streaming again for a bit. Just need to take a break :D Takes a lot of time to set everything up.**

**I got a test Tuesday so I may not do my daily post. Sorry, midterms week!**
