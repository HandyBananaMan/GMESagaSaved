Would work much better in the hundreds then the thousands\nEST 11:02am  1.4K \n\nEdit3: 11:15am 1.5k\nEdit4: 12:08pm 1.6k \nEdit5: 1:33pm 1.7k\nEdit6: 7:33pm 1.8k\n\nWATCH THIS PLEASE(if.you haven't already or maybe im late to the show)\n[educational](https://altcensored.com/watch?v=nLZp0ShwCiw)\n\nShitadel and Rh ARE THE SMALL.FISH IN THIS.\nDTCC is where the whole kit and kaboodle starts.\n\nThere have been many shitadels in the past 30 years. RH and retail trading with easier access has just made it easier to leech money. Im gonna safely assume that DTCC is the ONLY entity who has access to the inside of the market, darkpools and all.\n\nAnd you want the best part. I knew this. But it still needs to be pointed out for those who don't know.\n\nDTCC IS A PRIVATE COMPANY. WHO HAS AUTHORITY OVER THIS IF OUR GOVT CANT ASK OR UNDERSTAND QUESTIONS ABOUT NAKED SHARES!? OR EVEN SHORTS?  THATS WHAT THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON AND ITS BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR YEARS! BUT CHEERS BECAUSE THEY SHIFTED THE NARRATIVE TO KIDS GAMBLING!\n\nBut lets get honest. I know that's not happening. There is to much at stake if they put their slimy hands in it.\n\nSo ill just hodl these golden tickets because that's the only power and difference i can make with the dreams of hitting the DTCC where it hurts. Because if anyone's the crooks(they all are) but its a private business with more power on this planet. \n\nOne thing i do want to point out though is in the video, SEC is known to jump ahead of the govt and make laws with no problem. But they fail to enforce them and the stories get rolled along and the narrative pushed away from said subject so people forget. So they can continue with their shit. It has to stop. Hopefully one day.\n\nThe launch is immanent and i hope i don't smash my head on any stars on the way up because i think i see a new tendie dip\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\n\nThe shills are downvote the crap out of this, so i suggest upvoting so more can see this video.\n\nEdit: i actually need to point out DTC, DTCC AND FINRA are all private businesses. With obvious lack of any federal oversite by the SEC. So.in other words. Better insurance \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 2: another beautiful examination that i noticed, that every video i find thats pretty good, all have super low likes and views(literally less the like 3k on most). Also shows me shills have been a tactic for a long time as well as the media to silence and hide the real truth. \nThe only time something will get done is if they HAVE to",
