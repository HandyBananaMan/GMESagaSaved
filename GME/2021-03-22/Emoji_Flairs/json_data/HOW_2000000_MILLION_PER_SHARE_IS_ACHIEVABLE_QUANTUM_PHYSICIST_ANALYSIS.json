The\u00a0**observer effect**\u00a0is the fact that observing a situation or phenomenon necessarily changes it\u201c\u201d\n\nIn ape: just by observing, the observer can change the very thing they are looking at.\n\nNow lets apply this here. Look at (observe) this image all day long, set it as your wallpaper. Get comfortable with seeing GME at this price. Get it engraved into your brain.\n\n$2,000,000 is literally the **FLOOR**.\u00a0\n\n\\*Now if you can please excuse me, I have some observing to do\\*\n\nAlso this is not financial advice, I am still being breastfeed by my dad.",
