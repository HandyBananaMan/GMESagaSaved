 There are 225k+ apes in this sub but most of the top voted posts are at only 30k?!  Fellow lurkers, now is the time to dust off your keyboard, drop a comment, smash the upvote, take the poll! 

This is not financial advice I’m just a smooth brained ape with diamond hands holding strong!
A huge thank you to all the mods and to everyone sharing DD, and to the community as a whole thank you for making this into the welcoming and supportive place that it has become! 🚀💫🌝
