Observation literally changes reality you smooth brained APES. 

Do you realise the significance of that sentence?

In quantum physics we call this the **OBSERVER EFFECT.**

“”The act of observing will influence the phenomenon being observed. The **observer effect** is the fact that observing a situation or phenomenon necessarily changes it“”

In ape: just by observing, the observer can change the very thing they are looking at.

Now lets apply this here. Look at (observe) this image all day long, set it as your wallpaper. Get comfortable with seeing GME at this price. Get it engraved into your brain.

$2,000,000 is literally the **FLOOR**. 

\*Now if you can please excuse me, I have some observing to do\*

Also this is not financial advice, I am still being breastfeed by my dad.
