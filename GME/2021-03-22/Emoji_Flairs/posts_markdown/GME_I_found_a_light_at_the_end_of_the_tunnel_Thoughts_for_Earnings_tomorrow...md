*This is not DD. My last post, people were all bent out of shape because they thought by me saying there could have been a dip and to be ready for it, that I was spreading FUD. Well, guess who was fucking right and I'd rather people be prepared than paper hand? I think those people who cried about FUD to anyone that mentions that GME might not go up every single day; my guess would be that they are probably playing with options and have their own timelines they want to hit.*

(Edit 1:  Feel free to Crosspost wherever.  I'm banned from WSB for "copying and pasting" DD back in Jan during the run up)

***The equation is simple. I buy Commons each week with my paycheck and then I sit on my hands until I'm rich.*** *I own $GME and I like the stock. I would personally gain if the stock went up. I've been sinking every cent I can each week into this stock since it went back up into the 100s the second time. That is what made me a true believer and my stimmy went towards buying it at $213. I also have the majority of my position in the 400s. I like the stock without any short interest. This is also not Financial Advice so don't listen to anyone on Reddit to how you invest your own money! (Happy SEC???).*

**\*First point of advice: Unless you are buying more, don't watch the stock all day everyday.** This thing is going to swing wildly and if it's causing you stress, just don't constantly look. I know many of us are WAAAYYY less productive since Jan. Well guess what! You can set price alerts and reduce that stress; I set one for $750 the other for $180. And now I've moved on with my life. Now, I just check on Fridays when I get paid and then buy in when my money hits my account. If the $180 one goes off, I would liquidate more assets to buy as many shares as I can. If the $750 goes off. I'll do a happy dance then reset it to $1000 and forget about it until $10,000 then $100,0000 then $1 Million etc.

**\*Second point, the day to day price of GameStop doesn't matter anymore. What?** This seems crazy to say but it doesn't matter. Is it 180? Is it 280? Is it $40? Is it $365? **It doesn't fucking matter.** The only prices that matter now are 0 and in the Thousands/Millions. If it goes to zero you will see me sucking dicks behind your local Wendy's.  If it's in the thousands.....I own that Wendy's now.  If you aren't going to sell unless you are rich, then the DAILY price doesn't matter. If it hugely dips, (\*And it might) I am going to buy more!! Even if it means I have to sell blood, sperm, start driving an Uber on the side and I never see my kids for a couple months......when we have more money than I know what to do with.....it will be worth it!!

This ties into the second point which is the End Game! We have 3 possible scenarios.

1. **GME still has a shit tons of short interest hidden in it and they will eventually get squeezed out- either slowly or quickly.Slowly:** This then turns into a Tesla situation. People short. TSLA would sell stock to raise money, then use that money to grow their company and meet goals. The price would go up after earnings, Shorts would pile in again, TSLA would raise money by selling more stock and then repeat over years.**Quickly:** Short squeeze lasting days or weeks like VW back in 2008
2. **\*\*I don't think this is legally possible but I have to mention it. \*\*\*Somehow the shorts are able to weasel out of their positions by sucking/jerking off the DTCC, Politicians, etc. and then somehow snake out of their short positions without triggering a full on squeeze. (Bring on the "Oh he's spreading FUD hate" but just read the paragraph below. Spoiler, we still win and it's not FUD. I'm just stating a hypothetical scenario since I'm trying NOT to be completely blind to the amount of corruption I've seen over the last 3 months)*****I really don't think this is legally possibl*****e** but let's cover it, to just show **even worse case scenario, we still win.** So let's just say the shorts somehow sucked enough dicks to somehow get out of their positions. The sheer amount of dick sucking this would require, I can't even fathom. I literally can't even explain how this could even happen. I don't have a feasible way this could occur without breaking like a million laws but let's say they find a loopholes the size of the SEC's blind spot for hedge funds.

Now, in this dystopian world of no laws.....we have close to no short interest against GME and the stock can actually price discover without a 100,000 lbs weight tied to it's ankle. So now, let's say GameStop transforms into an E-Commerce gaming giant and let's say they sell 5 million shares at $200, that would raise $1 Billion in cash. Or let's say they issue 10 million shares, that's $2 billion in cash. That really wouldn't dilute the existing shares because the current float is so low compared to others. With that kind of cash, they could literally buy a couple of major gaming studios across the board. They could easily go towards like a Steam like online purchasing type platform and they have a rabid shareholder base who are also customers. **You get rich still but just takes longer.** ***I really don't think it happens this way but I felt the need to show that even if the worse case scenario happens, it still means the stock could succeed.***

3. **The Board Meeting: Covered in the Section below**

# GameStop's Annual General Meeting (AGM) could bring all the cards crashing down for shorts.

(Last years was June 12, so my guess would be around the same timeframe this year.  I repeat I'm not putting dates on here.  After reading this DD from  [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/user/atobitt/) I think we might be safe to assume that Blackrock might be calling back their shares.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7o7iy/blackrock\_bagholders\_inc/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7o7iy/blackrock_bagholders_inc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf))

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*I'm not a lawyer and I'm happy to make edits if I interpreted anything incorrectly. Please just let me know and I'll fix anything I messed up.\*\*\*Ok, so if you made it this far here: this is the possible end game for the Shorts. ***There is one ultimate thing that could happen that would COMPLETELY and utterly fuck the shorts:*** **GameStop calling back ALL of their shares for their annual AGM/or an emergency meeting etc.**

Yeah, yeah, I heard that before and I already signed a petition blah blah blah. Yup most of us did. And nothing has happened right?

Listen, I worked for a Fortune 100 company years ago. Nothing happens quickly with them, and I mean nothing.....even if it will cost them millions or even billions. Think of a large corporation as a Cargo ship. They don't turn on a dime like a start up, they analyze, speak to lawyers, have case studies, etc. My old company spent close to 2 years and literally millions of dollars coming up with a new logo which my 3 year old could have done in about one min.

But, here is the interesting part of these annual board meetings. **So in order to figure out who has the most voting power/rights, they have to do a call back their shares.** This means they go to people like BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, etc since they own millions of shares which make up large % of the legit float. (Now, I heard BlackRock didn't care about voting rights last year, so they did not choose to locate their shares but that doesn't mean that they don't care this year.) **Last year at this time, GME was at $3.81 a share and being run into the ground. One year later, it's sitting at $194.70 a share as I write this.** They probably care a little more this year about voting rights. They have to find out how much voting power everyone has from the little guy with 1 share to the ones with millions.

When the GameStop asks for the shares back, they need the "REAL" actual shares. Remember now, there are only like **50.65 Million of them that actually exist with GME's float**. So this means if you are short, EVERYONE who you normally borrow your shares from; they are all being asked to return their shares **ALL AT THE SAME TIME**. You can't rob Peter to pay Paul. It's literally Game Over flashing across the screen for shorts. It's why they are freaking out. **This means that with an upcoming board meeting, this can't go on forever which I think some Apes don't realize. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.**

Without breaking laws, I don't see how they get past this obstacle. This is the one time that they can't snake around.

Remember, March of last year GME was at $3 dollars a share and this company was supposed to be out of business by now. Their corporate bonds were supposed to go worthless, **GameStop was supposed to be DEAD by this time this year**. We now sit here at $194 now just 1 year later and GameStop is going to be able to announce to everyone what they fuck they have been doing to turn around the company. (GameStop has a gag order before earnings)

They have to hire a new CFO which means that shareholders should have a right to vote. If someone can doublecheck for me about this but I thought I read that Ryan Cohen has a clause that says he can't do a hostile takeover of the company when he was buying a larger position. People keep speculating that he will be the new CEO but I don't know about that. ***They also have to address the issues with shares at some point this year if we keep complaining about it. Remember "The squeaky wheel gets the oil" Well, Squeak Squeak motherfuckers.***

If GameStop calls back their shares, shorts can't pull oh, I'm sure these shares are around here somewhere move. All of these intuitions that lent their shares out, they all need them back to show GameStop how much voting power they have and all at the same time. They can dick around with the price all they want. I know when I am buying my shares, I'm not doing anything shady. I like the stock and think it's going up.

Earnings Report:  You can pre-register to listen to the Earnings Report here and I'll be listening in myself, because I want to hear what they have to say. It's tomorrow at 5pm.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Last point for tomorrow before earnings:  **Normal Hedge Fund activity is to tank stocks right after earnings**.  Like this is a pretty well known tactic for people who have been around the markets long enough to understand them.  I started trading options last year and lost a shit ton of what would have been very successful trades had I not crumbled.

For example, I was holding onto lets just say a shit ton of dollars worth of Jan 2022 QQQ calls with a Strike price 280 which were profitable back in Late Aug of last year.  We started getting some earnings calls in and Quad witching in Sept or something like that and I started losing a lot of money quickly.  I freaked out and sold for a huge loss......literally like a month later I would have been fine.  I had plenty of time on the options and could have easily rode it out but we were going into elections which I thought was going to be the next crash.  Instead of being up hundreds of thousands I took like a HUGE hit to my account.  Why?  I didn't know that was like normal shit.

So I'm telling you now.  I don't care what happens tomorrow.  I'm looking long term at this company and I'd buy any dip it gives me a this point.  DO NOT TRY TO TRADE IT.   That same news could just as easily be taken I'm going in by another fund or institutional investor and then take off.  I'm long GME and not selling even if they say nothing in their meeting and the stock tanks the next day.  I'm long GME.  Just be aware, HF's try to confuse people.  You think the earnings are good and you see a huge sell off.  You see your money going down and people panic sell.  I did it like 7 times last year that I now HUGELY regret but I was learning.

# It's important to note that YOU are responsible for recalling your own shares, nobody is going to recall them for you. This means that you have to contact your broker and inquire about your shares being lent out. If they are or possibly could be lent out you need to ask your broker about recalling them or preventing them from being lent out. For most brokers this will likely mean that you must be on a cash account and not a margin account. For most brokers, their margin account agreements state that they will lend out your shares. Some brokers may allow you to opt out and some may not. It is your responsibility to contact your broker if you want to exercise your voting rights or if you want to prevent your shares from being lent out or recall them if they are.

Some have mentioned that there might be possible collusion between the lenders (blackrock) and borrowers (citadel). This could explain why they didnâ€™t recall their shares last year, and could explain why the borrow fee isnâ€™t increasing even though availability is decreasing. Blackrock has an interest in preserving the solvency of citadel and other shorts. If this is the case, a share recall might not trigger a squeeze, if the lenders waive the recall again. I personally am waiting for the approval of the DTCC supplemental liquidity requirement amendment. Once this happens any catalyst could create enough organic buying pressure to generate a gamma squeeze that could lead to the shorts being margin called.

**TLDR:** Basically Earnings is tomorrow. I expect they to do some fuckery this week. I see a light at the end of the tunnel in the form of the Shareholders: Annual General Meeting. I'm not putting a date on anything but there will be a time a couple weeks before the annual meeting that they have to collect/count GME shares. Which means that EVERYONE who wants a vote would have to "return" shares to GME to be counted. **This means: Real shares will have to make their way back to their original owners if their owners would like to vote before the June meeting.** Not giving a date!   Just saying some potential light at the end of the tunnel.

If retail owns more than we think, this could be interesting, because people like Small Whales who are long to even someone like DFV might have way more say if the big guys don't seem interested in having voting rights returned to them....

DOMO Capital who has long been on GME's long side.  They said last year that people who should have had voting rights did not get to vote because brokerages could not locate their shares.  That was a year ago.  So they said to check with your brokers to make sure that you will have your votes counted and that the shares weren't lent out
