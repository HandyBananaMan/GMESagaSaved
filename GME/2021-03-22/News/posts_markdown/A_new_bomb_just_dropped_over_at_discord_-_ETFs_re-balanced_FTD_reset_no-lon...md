This just being dropped over at [GME discord](https://discord.gg/gmeofficial) dd-discussion channel. User ~~Pickle Kim~~ **(See Edit)** plowed through and found ETFs actually re-balanced but no websites were updated. If true, SHFs can no longer reset FTD dates and the time bomb is SET where they are forced to cover the FTDs after 5 consecutive days of FTD, at T+13.

He said he will do a DD on here but if you wanna read the discussion so far, in discord:**search >**  **in:#dd-discussion** **from: Pickle Kim#5171**

**NOT MY DD, I'm just a messenger**

**Don't set dates, but enjoy the discovery of imminent bombsðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€**
