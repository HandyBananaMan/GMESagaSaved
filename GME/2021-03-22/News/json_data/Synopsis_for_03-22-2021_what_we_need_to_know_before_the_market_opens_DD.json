    "selftext": "Good morning San Diago,\n\nI am Rensole,\n\nCan someone go check on Ken? I kindof want my sundae...\n\n\\*insert flashy intro card\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jptkb29yqjo61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=98f0aa2db1ee9dd774606f79c86d99770e030f0f\n\nFirst of all as always none of this is financial advice, just an idiot with a win 95 terminal writing shit.\n\n# Q4 Earnings report.\n\nOk so I've been getting a lot of messages regarding what I expect of the Q4 earnings report.\n\nA few things to keep in mind for this:\n\nDue to the pandemic a lot more people have been staying inside and gaming more than usual.\n\nNintendo reported to have had a record breaking sales year [seen here](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)\n\nRC only stated his investment of GME around November and only stepped into a official capacity in January (Jan 10th as I believe).\n\nSo the true echo of this entire thing will be noticeable in the Q1 Earnings report, even so I expect the Q4 Earnings to be positive, but by  looking at everything going on I believe that we wont see the true extent until the Q1 and Q2 2021 earnings reports.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcmiddl7sjo61.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f9c4f6bcea3b3681019fb33f00df82fdde0c4f2\n\n# Wen Ceo?\n\nOk so what I have noticed is that usually (again purely from what I've seen) A new CEO will be appointed after the Quarterly earnings report, if RC won't be called in as CEO directly, relax it's not always a direct line, right now he is focusing on making the inside of GME healthy again.\n\nAnd that means he can become CEO in the next week, but it may just as well be within the next six months, for example he can do it by June with the international shareholder meeting.\n\nRemember we have no clock, there is no sense of urgency.\n\nit will come when it comes\n\nAlso going by the information [of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mafvpz/jim_bell_was_not_the_only/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nit seems that the board(george Sherman) and 3 of his cronies (Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez and Kathy Vrabeck) tried to keep Cohen out, why? well if they where in cahoots with Melvin or Citadel then it would be in their best interest to keep Ryan and his new team out as much as they can.\n\nFunny enough on all their slips (seen in the screenshots in that post) Jim Bell (now EX CFO) was the lawyer for all three of these people.\n\nFuckery, is afoot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sup Melvin](https://preview.redd.it/p7y5rg1lujo61.jpg?width=535&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4530cbeeaaba0eaab02bdd4220b2763e9ea34d27)\n\n# To Squeeze or not to Squeeze,\n\nOk so this is the most found Fud I've seem to come across so let's nip this in the butt as much as we can.\n\n\"GmE WoNt SqUeZe GeT 0Ut\"\n\nBullshit, listen at this point it's easy, it doesn't matter if it squeezes or not, if you look at how GME is transforming itself right now it is still a solid investment in my opinion as the company's worth is not yet reflected in it's price.\n\nHow am I so sure? as this stock is currently still very manipulated and it's still at around the 200 mark, so I see this stock on it's own (sans squeeze) hover between the 500 to 1000 mark (depending on how well they transform the company, but with RC at the helm I see this going to a 1000 minimum).\n\n\"We OwN ThE Fl0aT\"\n\nWe dont, not yet.\n\nIf we owned the entire float it would be impossible for us to buy any shares.\n\nSo if you look at the fact that we can still buy them, I know because I was able to get 10 more on friday, it means there is still float available.\n\n\"BuT ThEy ArE SyNtHetic\"\n\nDon't mean shit, if you bought them, they're yours, it's your bank/broker/dealer (sup Tyrone) job to give you real ones, if they end up being synthetic (which in and of themselves would be weird as melvin and shitadel need those for shorting) then you can still sell them later on for the same worth as the real ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Fuddering\n\nAlright let's post some funny stuff people have found over the weekend, related to fud, Vlad the stock Impaler's company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pt8oakygwjo61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5eb920f910356d6e966af22a143bfc673229b7c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdfmo64owjo61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b503b1526ee17ec83416ca6b77549fa53e734c\n\n**Addendum:** [**https://www.upwork.com/job/Redditor-looking-for-someone-post-Reddit\\_\\~01397c3ee182712312/**](https://www.upwork.com/job/Redditor-looking-for-someone-post-Reddit_~01397c3ee182712312/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure if real or not but seems like something they'd do, as remember they have everything to lose, if I was in their position I would do everything I could.\n\nBecause if they can FUD out enough people they may be able to survive, and the fines they receive are a slap on the wrist at worst. remember they view fines just as \"the cost of doing business\".\n\n# Gme earnings conference call\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpuqafcaxjo61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb5841642779b3d1f07045172ec4a4d4c21c784\n\nGameStop Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings CallIt is scheduled for: Tue, Mar 23, 2021 5:00 PM EDT\n\n[https://investor.gamestop.com/home](https://investor.gamestop.com/home)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe sure to register beforehand, because we will most likely \"force choke\" their ISP by just wanting to be informed. Seriously GME I'm already sorry for the amount of internet traffic this will get.\n\nif you can't connect to it don't worry I'll be tuning in and I will be taking notes throughout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wukcvigyxjo61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cc1baa6fc7a76b25cc6870ba17d1118a19d7de5\n\n# The Yearly Shareholders meeting.\n\nSo a smart ape u/zakataha found this:\n\n[2020](https://preview.redd.it/yqi8yqceyjo61.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6732c4b5fd889bb307faa8a8b983aa085278c9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2021](https://preview.redd.it/xi9hlq4fyjo61.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c2a3c7fe20841d1fe4a25af2bf29f683fa3520)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9enm6/i\\_believe\\_that\\_the\\_next\\_annual\\_date\\_is\\_june\\_10/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9enm6/i_believe_that_the_next_annual_date_is_june_10/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this may also be why we have not yet seen a recall on GME's end. Due to Texas law you can at max ask for 60 days before the meeting for the shares to be recalled. so at the earliest expect mid April for this.\n\nThe thing is that we've also read that Blackrock has a big portion but didn't recall their shares as they didn't care enough to vote, but this was a previous year and it was a very different scenario. due to everything happening it could be that GME themselves recall the shares due to expectation of fraud.\n\n**Addendum:** I've also read some people post \"oh but they outweigh RC so he wont get voted in\", to those people I'd like to say, WELCOME TO CORPERATE LIFE!\n\nHe can get either voted in (which is very likely Imo) OR he could just buy more shares and do a hostile takeover, one way or another, if he man wants that seat he'll get it as he's got the money to do a Hostile takeover but I think giving the current BOD this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlso (please prove me wrong with this) I've been looking into the current CEO George Sherman, and I've not seen him post, or offer any comments on the current situation what so ever, which is weird to say the least.\n\nNow being in a publicly traded company does bring along certain limits, you can't just say what you want against short sellers, because people know it could hurt their company, so they'd rather keep their head down and go through the storm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tximmsq40ko61.jpg?width=501&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5522fcbbd95bba39e163192de36d9283ae79ea7\n\n# Fuddruckers?\n\nNow it has been quiet in the past weekend to my knowledge, I've been offline for 99% of the time but still. it seems that they're trying what I speculated last week and the week before.\n\nGet the members who are doing their best to help the community and either get them banned or get them discredited.\n\n[Welp here we go](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/maikv1/after_my_ban_was_revoked_hedgies_are_trying_to/)\n\nI'm not saying that the people who are doing this are bot's shills or trolls, I'm just saying stay vigilant against all forms of FUD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Muskinator entered the chat\n\n# \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lxalzad01ko61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7e261ad10e58a8c83439ee639eb54f67258ffbd\n\nPeople have noticed that both RC and DFV are following Elon, this may be because of a simple reason, he's a funny guy? also Elon has expressed interest in adding gaming in his cars for quite some while now (I believe this originated at around 2018/2019).\n\nBut what's interesting is this:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop)\n\nIt could be that Tesla is going to add in some form of gaming in their cars, and given the fact that GME is currently actively looking to extend their business in all different types and forms, so this does not confirm anything, it's just nice to see the link and who knows, we may see a tesla with built in gaming rigs for long drives or charging sessions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjk90c0q1ko61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88f4d8fe89c4c0817ea4f81ccb316cad55a5ce0e\n\n# Most of you are helping Citadel without knowing it.\n\nAs stated in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mai4pe/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/) there are a lot of people helping Citadel without knowing it.Check your broker in that post, check your settings and be sure to set everything correctly.\n\nWe have also seen a lot of post stating that if you use OPTIONS, there is a huge chance that you're helping the other side, because who writes these options? and who do they work with?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gygliic2ko61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=93c4c2c2e9cac655bfdef069d907aaf3c9decec7\n\n# DFV has spoken\n\nOk for the people who don't know this here is Michael Jacksin, the KING of POP!\n\nthe songs he performed there:\n\n* \"Jam\" (includes beginning of \"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\")\n* \"Billie Jean\"\n* \"Black or White\"\n* \"We Are the World\" (children's choir)\n* \"Heal the World\"\n\nInteresting thing about MJ, this was his glove:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9763kcm2ko61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d0ac4648464b9faa3884306db0d41dac47347b\n\nMofo was literally diamond handed.\n\nAnd his signature move?
