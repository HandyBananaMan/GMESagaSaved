<p>This just being dropped over at <a href="https://discord.gg/gmeofficial">GME discord</a> dd-discussion channel. User ~~Pickle Kim~~ <strong>(See Edit)</strong> plowed through and found ETFs actually re-balanced but no websites were updated. If true, SHFs can no longer reset FTD dates and the time bomb is SET where they are forced to cover the FTDs after 5 consecutive days of FTD, at T+13.</p>
<p>He said he will do a DD on here but if you wanna read the discussion so far, in discord:<strong>search &gt;</strong>  <strong>in:#dd-discussion</strong> <strong>from: Pickle Kim#5171</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOT MY DD, I'm just a messenger</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don't set dates, but enjoy the discovery of imminent bombsðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</strong></p>

<p>Edit: u/Turdfurg23 claims that he's the originator of the idea/DD.</p>
