Update: We made it to #11 on r/frontpage - think about that, what you apes did 👀🤔💎✊. But no good deed goes unpunished: The bots, shills and haters are now, predictably, descending into the comments; I just got permanently banned from sellout r/WSB - can’t imagine why ... who cares 🤷; and, to the person who reported me to Reddit Crisis Management, thanks no thanks. 🤜🤛🤣 

Be strong apes. The hate is real. But what gives me resolve is that *for every ape here* - who has raised their hand, from ALL over the world - *there are countless more apes silently HODLing strong*. 🦍💎✊

🚨Remember, invest at your level. *Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.* Not financial advice: just common sense.
