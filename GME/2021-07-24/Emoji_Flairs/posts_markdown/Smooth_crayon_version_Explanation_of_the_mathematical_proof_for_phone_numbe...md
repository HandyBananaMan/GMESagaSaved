# Title: Smooth crayon version: Explanation of the mathematical proof for phone number prices and Infinity Pool is what HFs are scared most. This is real, verifiable stuff which justifies any size of the floor. Total shorts disclosed by Fed on 30th will be very useful.

Ok so few days ago I did some [maths](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ondeot/mathematical_proof_for_phone_number_prices_under/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) as a proof of infinite squeeze possibility if majority of shares are sold during MOASS by all these shills around. Of course, this calculation doesn't go through all the complications such as ETFs, but the main point is valid and proven.

Here is a smooth version.

The question:

“What happens if in fact some shareholders are so retarded that they’ll decide to never sell some of their shares? And in effect more than a freefloat of shares is rendered as not-for-sale?”

I ate all the crayons except blue and red so the tasty part comes painted with my feaces.

Now, someone is tasked with erasing everything except poo from this piece of art. It can be done with a rubber of brand **Buyshorted**. But **Buyshorted** rubber erases only blue crayons. Red stays forever. This leads to situation where closing all shorts is impossible.

The specific conditions (% of shares to hold forever) for such scenario are in the original post, here is only the strongest:

**TL;DR: if the amount of naked shorts is exceeding 200% as it has been counted by some DDs, infinite squeeze and prices approaching infinity is not an unreal scenario.** In that scenario price would be set by those who hold the shares as a "ask price" in the sell order and they can demand arbitrary number.

A new thing came up, i.e. [there will be new daily-averaged report disclosed by Fed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oq6efq/start_here_next_friday_july_30th_at_415pm_the/) which may help quantify total naked shorts of the GME. That number can be used to determine the critical size of the # of shares held forever which will cause infinite squeeze.

So publication of these numbers may create a very, very strong buying pressure as it indirectly would back what is stated in this post.
