If they would we know to 100% that the short interest is above 100%, every ape will hold after this to the Million and wont sell. Right now we can only guess how it is. People maybe think of selling at 5 or 10k even if they say now i will hold into the millions. They will play with our psyche till the end. For everyone, except the apes, are paperhands the best thing.
