<p>If you also notice, they are extremely active on Twitter before January 21st, which also coincides with GME hitting $380ish within the following few days, up from $45 January 21st. </p>
<p>Put the DD aside for one second and just use your brain and common sense. This is not a coincidence and I wouldn’t be surprised if they just completely closed there entire marketing and social media jobs they employed. </p>
<p>I, personally, who is not a financial advisor, rather, a crown snorting monkey, will not feel happy with my gains unless Kenny is lower class citizen after this unfolds. </p>
<p>Thank you gentleman and may all your asshole’s be steadily prepared for deep impact during liftoff. </p>
