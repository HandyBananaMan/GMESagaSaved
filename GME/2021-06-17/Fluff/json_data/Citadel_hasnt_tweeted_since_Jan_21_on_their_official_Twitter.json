This is not a coincidence and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they just completely closed there entire marketing and social media jobs they employed. \n\nI, personally, who is not a financial advisor, rather, a crown snorting monkey, will not feel happy with my gains unless Kenny is lower class citizen after this unfolds. \n\nThank you gentleman and may all your asshole\u2019s be steadily prepared for deep impact during liftoff. \n\nEdit: citadel official Twitter: https://mobile.twitter.com/Citadel",
