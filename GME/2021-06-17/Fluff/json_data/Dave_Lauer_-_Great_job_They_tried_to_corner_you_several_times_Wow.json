    "selftext": "Holy smokes. u/dlauer you did fantastic today with the MSM interview fast money show. They tried to corner you 2-3x to get a sound byte of you accusing shitadel of market manipulation. But you wouldn't let them have it!\n\nLoved it when you said that sounded like a dangerous question to answer! You would never accuse an entity of market manipulation - good answer!\n\nMSM is not your friend. I really hope people stop getting interviewed unless they are primed beforehand.\n\nEdit 6/18/21: Dave Lauer got massive flak for his new retail centric market data platform being advertised on Superstonk. Of course I posted this praise before I saw those posts/comments. I think people reacted accordingly but I also believe people deserve the benefit of the doubt because we are all human (innocent till PROVEN guilty). To take that away means we are just numbers on a screen just like the oligarchy sees us. Apes are NOT that.",
