    "selftext": "Good morning San Diago,\n\nI am Rensole,\n\nMelvin your wife forgot her purse here.... again\\*insert flashy intro card\\*\n\nNo financial advice just a retard drooling on his keyboard!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t8hbs5kd6l61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c5f1b161a89f24f31fe8f7808851761ede3a981\n\n# My own thread?\n\nJust woke up and found [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxywg9/thankyou_rensole/)\n\nGuys thank you so much, you know how to make a fucking retard feel loved \u2764\n\nBut I do have to say one thing, I only do the morning news, the other mods put in an equal amount of work into this sub behind the scenes. I'm not the main mod nor do I think anyone is, this is a group effort.\n\nAnd most importantly I have to thank each and every one of you guys, without you guys it would be impossible to do what I do, you guys tag me in stuff that could be important and point out if I haven't looked at something in a certain way. so without you this wouldn't be possible.\n\nWe put a lot of faith in you guys, to also self govern this community, and you're doing a great job, seen a lot of jokes that crack me up and comradery I've rarely seen in other places.\n\nAs for the people who said how to give me something after all of this is done, thank you!You see, *I'm* a *guy* of *simple* tastes: I enjoy dynamite, and gunpowder, the smell of gasoline, and 1960's fastback mustangs. I've never been one like Griffin or Melvin, I don't like expensive stuff.\n\nBut thank you everyone none the less <3 I love all of you retards.\n\n# \n\n# Hello papa Cohen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cohens new tweet.](https://preview.redd.it/3q3grkcbf6l61.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=343515c8430adcd4fbdcf8650573bfd2abc70a7f)\n\nSome of you younger guys may not recognize this ugly motherfucker, but this ~~CUMSOCK~~ Sockpuppet used to be the old mascot from [Pets.com](https://Pets.com)\n\n[Pets.com](https://Pets.com) used to be the dot coms love baby and I believe even one of the last to go.\n\nThis specific picture is from a well known commercial that even went viral here in Europe at the time.A smart ape made a good thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxzi4m/ryan_cohens_tweet_explained_why_gamestop_will_be/) by  [u/socrates6210](https://www.reddit.com/user/socrates6210/)\n\nThe most important take aways from it are this:\n\n* Daddy Cohen is basically screaming at us that he is transforming GameStop into the next Amazon.\n* We may need to wait another while for the next rally, but this is proof that the last spike in price wasn't just a one off.\n* lets ride the fucker into the moon and leave a massive rocket shaped hole in it \ud83d\ude80\n* Cohen took a failed business ([pets.com](https://pets.com)) changed it and turned it into the AMAZON for pets, such a vision for a company is amazing, as [pets.com](https://pets.com) proved it was impossible to do a pets website, but look at [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) now. Imagine if Cohen does the same for GME (which i'm sure he will)\n* Shortly after tweeting this the price soared from around $119 -> $147.87 before dropping off.\n* Hedgie's are fearful of Cohen because at any moment he could make a press release about GameStop and the price will soar, sending them into bankruptcy.\n* **HOLD THE FUCKING LINE**\n\nSomething to keep in mind, his tweets do spell a narrative, lets see them chronologically.\n\nBenjamin Franklin picture with the quote; \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/niq01yali6l61.jpg?width=294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21cc40171e42ad7b247a7482df33685f36ee4ab2\n\nBlockbuster with \ud83d\udca9 emoji\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvkzcurmi6l61.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee31a222d7209b8ca6821633ba8089f8783527d3\n\nDumb and Dumber gif with the quote \"so you're telling me there is a chance\"\n\nwith \ud83e\udd5cemoji\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fbhn91dri6l61.gif\n\nMACD sundae with \ud83d\udc38emoji\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g69qi3qyi6l61.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8448cd5b9254519e4d1ee0523fcfddecf6396473\n\nand last, the [pets.com](https://pets.com) mascot with \ud83e\udd22 emoji.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bx43loh2j6l61.jpg?width=1354&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4910568488623438cfa637da554ab9e8935054c1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you can have several beliefs and all would be correct\n\n1. The tweets all show a narrative, and you see a story here\n2. the tweets all have deeper meaning than someone would believe at first glance\n3. both\n4. Cohen is trolling (would be weird but still possible)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nlipozwuh6l61.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e7bbe08c60630a0e44c151195a60f2ab735b740\n\n# $TITS $ASS $CUM ... WUT?\n\nSo our smart apes here found something out that I've been thinking for a long time, there where some news articles about how they are now monitoring boards so they'd knew what we'd do (buying the dip and holding Melvin it's not a hard concept get with the program).\n\nBut it seems that they actually do a dragnet of often used tickers, this means that whatever gets posted with a ticker like mention, get's reposted by their bots, it happened with SNDL, TLRY, SSR and now.... they are actually reposting $TITS $ASS $CUM.\n\nIf someone told me I'd be in a fight with a billionaire over digital $TITS $ASS and $cum... yeah I'd believe m I mean... I know what I'm about.\n\nSo by having these shitposts here is in a way good for us, this means that the bots will focus on those tickers, and are easy to weed out.\n\nAlso the funniest thing ever, I found out just minutes ago $CUM is an actual company... I never snorted coffee so hard over my screen as I did just now.\n\nThis does bring an entirely new meaning to Pump and Dump, Pump the $ASS Dump the $CUM... my god 80.000 years of technological evolution brought us to this.... and I fucking love it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prnxizmjj6l61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=78cd08a976ede8d2dd321d2a266a9b66a3b95935\n\n# Rip our fallen brothers.\n\nThis is no surprise to anyone, when the market turns red, GME GO BRRRR \ud83d\ude80\n\nWhy is this?\n\nwell Hedge funds have more than just one stock, and when gme go's up so do the costs to hold them juicy shorts, so they need to sell to be able to stay afloat, this is normal.\n\nBecause if they didn't they would've been gone by now.\n\nso if gme keeps going this way expect the market to stay like this for a while.\n\n[https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrjmo2i4k6l61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3823a86ca585b75605bf2d78349757c6512f4076\n\n# Statistical analysis.\n\nI've seen a lot of apes post about [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx4gbv/yall_this_is_statistically_significant_action/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) thread, statistics are the basis of which the market can be analyzed, but keep in mind, we are retarded apes, Market makers also have the same (i think even better) data, so they expect the same, so as always expect fuckery.\n\nExpect everything to go down today, expect it to rocket so hard we will crater into mars.It's Friday so anything can fucking happen. but the course stays the same.\n\nGet some of that sweet fucking dip, hold the line, laugh at the Cucks at Melvin and Citadel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bro' tein God of Gains](https://preview.redd.it/a7y3cnwyk6l61.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d267ae761f0af412bde5f05553005d454a4e6503)\n\n# Gain porn,\n\nSeriously don't post this until everything is over, even if they are unrealized gains at this point. it's a double edged sword for morale.\n\nNoobs may post it wrong, and people think they're already out, this in turn can create FUD. we hate FUD.\n\nSo do your part, it's ok to say you're portfolio is up X%, don't go around posting your gains just yet, the squeeze is not yet squoze so let's keep moral high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I'm seriously recycling this image more than I recycle irl](https://preview.redd.it/vwbrfyrjl6l61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=94c6433af51e707229a1c9b3d4897bd80d9b6eac)\n\n# FUD Bots shills and trolls\n\nIt's Friday, this means we will see an increase in Bots, Shills and Trolls over the next few days.\n\nIgnore them, report them, move on.\n\nSeriously who the fuck are they going to troll/shill to if everyone is out ?\n\nThis is the same as letting people invade an empty city, they run in screaming only to realize that no one is in this town anymore.\n\nSo here is an assignment for all of you, this weekend don't visit this Sub.\n\nGo out, have a drink with friends, your wife and her BF.\n\nGo see some movies or videogame\n\nOr like me, go fuck around the house humping every pillow to assert dominance over the couch.\n\nDoesn't matter what you do, in the weekend the stock market is closed, and all you beautiful apes should be out in the word doing fun shit, and you come back on Monday, refreshed and full of shit to fling and have fun again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[haha yeah I know](https://preview.redd.it/zuz7p2mcm6l61.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8569082a9fd3a321662376c3d1a47493dfb1523)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Friday Fuckey day.\n\nWe had some people refer to Monday as double dip Monday DDM, well I'm coining the phrase Friday Fuckery day FFD.\n\nFriday is a day that can get wild as fuck, I mean drunk punk rock chick with red hair at a metal festival type of crazy, she can be a lot of fun but you know it's always trouble with them before it even happens.\n\nToday we can see GME rocket to the god damn moon and our way to Neptune where it rains diamonds, but we can also see it go back to $40. so don't worry the price doesn't matter at the end of the day, Melvin is shitting himself, because when Ryan Cohen (or RC) tweets this motherfucker knows that this can pop, all we need is some news from GME HQ and this shit will hit the fan.\n\nGME announces they start a partnership with anyone BOOM\n\nGME announces RC is now CEO BOOM\n\nGME says it's going to offer red headbands BOOM\n\nSeriously this is a moron who thought it was good to sail 100kg of gunpowder in 1720 barrels to make a quick buck and all it's needed to set it all off is some idiot with a smoke and it go's sky high. and Melvin knows that.\n\nANYTHING can set this motherfucker off at this point, but don't expect melvin to take this lying down like his wife does.\n\n# Music;\n\nEven music can soothe the savage apes. and it's great for Morale ;)\n\nSo just to add a little hype here are some music numbers to get you in the mood\n\n[classic

is financial advice, I still have yesterday's hotwheel stuck in my ass.\n\nHave a great weekend everybody, and remember keep a level head, and don't let the fuckery get to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5s2aqbt3p6l61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1af066ca3fa7db0a4f69007e35e8b08b7062defa\n\nIf I forgot anything let me know I'll add it
