<p>That is the point, it has been a game for decades, only the titans on Wall Street were holding all the cards.  Now the ‚Äúretail traders‚Äù along with some big whales are FINALLY EXPOSING THE GAME, AND NOW THAT WE ARE ONES WINNING, MEDIA IS CRYING THAT WE ARE DESTROYING THE MARKET WITH GAMIFICATION.</p>
<p>IF THE SYSTEM WASN‚ÄôT RIGGED, NOBODY COULD POSSIBLY GAME THE MARKET.
THE PUBLIC FOUND OUT AND NOW WE ARE HOLDING THE CARDS.</p>
<p>GAME STOP.
POWER TO THE PLAYERS!
