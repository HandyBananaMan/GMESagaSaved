If this gets anywhere near 100k (hell, even 1k) I see myself donating ~20%. And continuously donating after I've reinvested my gains. 

When the news is blaming us for the market collapse, let them see that our first thoughts as millionaires is to help those in need, not to hoard wealth.

Any gain porn should be in the form of verifiable donation pics! Show yourself giving away consoles (bought at GameStop of course) at the children's hospital. Show the truckload of food you sent to the homeless shelter. Show your $10,000 donation statement to your local public radio station.

Don't let this be a transfer of wealth from the greedy to the greedy. This can be so much bigger than that. This can be a transfer of wealth from the greedy to *everyone*.

Edit: We could even make it a sort of competition. If you want to flaunt your gains, better post a huge donation!

Edit 2: Thanks to people like u/Gmebandwagoner reminding you to donate carefully and do your DD. I'll personally be buying my dad, who's working his ass off to help get me through college, a new truck that he desperately needs. I'll give to my public radio station. Those are my starting points. Family and local donations have the most impact.

Edit 3: Y'all hold me to this. 20% of my total at 1k or more per share. Including what I gives to friends and family.
