<p>I was prompted to commit a thread to this by another user so here goes.  A am not a financial advisor, just another ape trying to get a banana:</p>
<p>Basically I am reading users describing an exit strategy where they sell some shares at a really low, in their mind "safe", exit value to "get back" their initial investment early; then let the rest ride.</p>
<p>Normally, this is a solid strategy, conservative strategy.  As is selling a bit at a time when you anticipate an multiple upticks.</p>
<p>This is NOT A NORMAL SITUATION however.</p>
<p>What needs to be understood is how desperately these institutions NEED your stock, these are not your typical buyers. They NEED to cover their short positions at some point in time and to do that they NEED every one of your shares.  They are people that went BEYOND the notions of greed and hubris, overleveraging themselves to the brink of complete liquidation of their organizations.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett once said that it is wise for investors to be “<strong>fearful</strong> when <strong>others</strong> are <strong>greedy</strong>, and <strong>greedy when others</strong> are <strong>fearful</strong>.”</p>
<p>The hedge's shills, bots and trolls will continue to subtly and not-so subtly put the fear of god into you.  But it is they who are fearful.  Look at what happened to the original subreddit?  Look at the money they spend on disinformation, distraction, and FUD campaigns.  They will throw everything at holders and potential buyers to shake confidence.</p>
<p>If you need validation, look at the congressional hearing. The hearing where only 1 man didn't have a team of lawyers. Or, babble about being a child in Bulgaria to evade questions. Or, look like they were shooting a hostage video.  All the DD I needed was in the fear in their voices and body language.  They. Are. So. Fucked.  I have been fucked before, and in that same "not so good" way.  That is what it looked like.</p>
<p>Anyway, this same man of courage and integrity testified to his faith in the stock.  That SAME investor just a day later takes a large portion of their gains and reinvests it in the company, they have so much faith.</p>
<p>There is no clearer picture of what fear DOES and DOES NOT look like.</p>
<p>There WILL come a point where the price won't be able to be artificially manipulated, the price and then price will be set by SHAREHOLDERS.  I can not stress how VALUABLE your share is, whether you own 1 share or 100.  People are SERIOUSLY devaluing their own positions.</p>
<p>I can't imagine selling on the way UP because I am scared of losing the money I put in.</p>
<p>The squeeze will literally take DAYS and I am 100% sure that if my goal is not losing my investment, I will have more than enough time to secure that on the way down, if I miss the peak.</p>
<p>The price isn't dropping down to $100 or $40 in a minute or anything during a squeeze. Just look at the VW graph. DAYS for the squeeze and both sides of the peak are going to be symmetrical. It's just math.</p>
<p>People have got to do what it right for them, but selling before the peak is, as they say in France, "some bitch shit".  It is the epitome of a fearful play in this context.</p>
<p>Don't be scared of losing money, but more importantly, DON'T BE SCARED OF MAKING MONEY.</p>
<p>Use your head not your heart, most of us are plebes that would normally lose our shit if a stock we had hit 100 bucks, let alone 1000. Absolutely get out of that mindset, when the commas keep coming. This is uncharted territory. Most have no idea how high this can go because most of us are used to being happy with table scraps.  But we have the luxury of seeing where it goes, because you just have to hold your INVALAUABLE STOCK and see.</p>
<p>If you trust in the all the DD shared, at least hold until an exit point you can sleep with, and THEN only sell less than half because I can guarantee it will go higher than you thought it would,  no matter how high you thought it would.</p>
<p>If it peaks and you "miss" the peak, you'll still make insane profits on the downturn, which will, again, TAKE DAYS and be at values higher than whatever jump off point you set on the upturn.</p>
<p>Again, everybody do what is right for you, but I'm just shaking my head at people trying to "get my investment back" at 1000, 5000, etc.  If it gives you peace of mind, fine I guess. But I can literally EARN 1000 or 5000 bucks in less than a year, some of us I'm sure less than a month. I CAN NOT earn 100k, 200k, or 500k without years.</p>
<p>I personally couldn't sleep knowing I gave away say, 3 shares of a 100K+ stock at 1000 or 5000 bucks. Especially if I could have done that same move on the downturn.  I couldn't imagine. That's just me though.</p>
<p>Again, this is uncharted territory, this is not the time to be risk averse. People will NEVER have an investment opportunity like this in their lifetime. Let the institutions be scared, longs have nothing to fear. THEY NEED YOUR SHARES. Understand this.</p>
<p>The ONLY exception is if your overleveraged yourself on the investment and literally need the money to pay your rent, buy food, or payoff the payday loan you took out; and only then because time is actually an issue not the risk.</p>
<p>For everybody else, you have NOTHING BUT TIME.  Hold, take a walk, live your life.  Payday IS coming.  The longer this drags out the more painful and fearful it will be for the shorts, not the longs.</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Thanks for the support guys.  Awards are appreciated, but shouldn't you be buying more...you know. :)</p>
<p>It is important  when you are reading the subreddit and you see someone is in doubt (or spreading doubt), just reinforce what I am trying to say here.  SHAREHOLDERS should not be fearful.  Think with your heads, don't be scared of success!</p>
