Hi all,

Happy Friday! Here’s the daily update for my series of posts that started off as [bias-confirming fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lwsiai/just_for_fun_for_your_confirmation_bias_needs/)*,* which then [gained momentum](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx4gbv/yall_this_is_statistically_significant_action/), followed by [increased merit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxwv8r/statistical_analysis_march_4_update_pricing/).

As it was in the beginning, this is not meant to be financial advice, but a discussion on the correlation between the January run-up (defined as the dates January 6 to 28 inclusive) and the current run-up (defined as February 17 to the present day) with GME. Here are [additional notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxhatz/some_additional_thoughts_on_statistical_analysis/) on my approach.

Today’s calculations are based on the following input data:

# Results

* For the test comparing closing prices in the January run-up and our current run-up: Spearman's *ρ* = 0.96703, p-value (2-tailed) = 0. This is an *even stronger* correlation compared to yesterday's Spearman's *ρ* = 0.95804 and p-value (2-tailed) = 0
* For the test comparing volume between the same date ranges: Spearman's *ρ* = 0.62637, p-value (2-tailed) = 0.02199. This is a reduced correlation compared to yesterday's Spearman's *ρ* = 0.67832 and p-value (2-tailed) = 0.01532

In graph form:

[As in the last two days, the price increase strengthens the correlation between the two run-ups.](https://preview.redd.it/36hzilbt1al61.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=a00947502b13312d127f67aab2c9209ef656c865)

[On the other hand, we saw a continued trend in relatively low volume, thus reducing the correlation in volume activity between the two run-ups.](https://preview.redd.it/0u64bi692al61.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=1463b0456a597525d53daf1baa2d00372dbdc497)

# Analysis

I'll admit: I was hoping to see a large spike in price today, as it would have made for a visually appealing graph (well, and to have contracts with a strike price of $150 expire ITM). Even so, because the price ended higher than the day before, the correlation between the two run-ups is reinforced further.

In descriptive terms, we in effect have two date ranges in which the following occurred:

* Relatively flat prices from Day 1 to 5 (inclusive)
* A dramatic jump occurs on Day 6 (from $19.95 to $31.40 in Set A and from $44.97 to $91.71 in Set B)
* An increase from Day 6 to Day 7
* A slight decrease from Day 7 to Day 8
* An increase from Day 8 to 9
* A slight decrease from Day 9 to 10
* An increase from Day 10 to 11
* Another increase from Day 11 to 12; we spent most of March 4 in the red but in the end, the price recovered and then exceeded its previous close
* An increase from Day 12 to 13

The p-value of zero in the closing price test means this pattern shared between the two run-ups should not happen based on chance alone.

The lack of a major price spike is related to the volume. As the data on volume shows, there just isn't the momentum that was present in the January run-up. I suspect partial explanations include:

* most retail investors interested in GME are already in it, and have invested much of what they can spare into the play (such that further purchases now occur following a pay check, tax refund, etc.)
* the current price being higher than it was during the January run-up, such that even with additional funds, fewer shares are purchased
* institutional investors locked in some sort of stalemate, and that they are waiting to see who will blink or flinch first (and I personally believe the spike in volume today at 10:35 am EST was a test from the long side to see what the short side still had in them)

Additionally, recall that on January 26, [Elon tweeted "Gamestonk!!"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703) and [Chamath tweeted he had purchased calls](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354089928313823232). There was serious momentum that week, and that's missing in the current run-up.

Granted, both DFV and Ryan Cohen have been tweeting this week, but their content is intentionally vague. Neither can risk being too direct because the former is connected to the ongoing hearings by the [U.S. House Committee on Financial Services](https://twitter.com/FSCDems/status/1367247053991022592) and the latter cannot risk being charged with stock market manipulation and insider trading. They each require plausible deniability.

Think on it:

>Congressman, I just happen to like old movies.

—DFV, probably

and

>Congressman, I just like ice cream sundaes.

—Ryan Cohen, if it got to it, probably

Members of this community can make sense of their tweets, but unless/until there is a trigger for high-volume buying (pick any of the popular catalysts), I think this run-up will get stretched out. That's cool though, because it just means a more explosive squeeze if/when it occurs.

I recommend reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxyjdh/tomorrow_gme_is_mooning_the_ttm_squeeze_explained/) and [its follow-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lyh8cm/gme_squeeze_indicator_update/) by u/possibly6 if you haven't already. My statistics are reaching their limit (because the cut-off to the previous run-up was on January 28), but the technical aspects continue to stand. I'm still learning MACD, but u/Bootheskies attests that the indicator is still on track in imitating January's pattern.

**TLDR** (for u/MrPinkFloyd)

* It's not just luck: a run-up like the one in January really is happening
* What's missing is high-volume buying
* Technical indicators support the idea that it's only a matter of time

I’ve spent more time than what’s usual for me on Reddit this week, and I’m unplugging a bit this weekend. However, I’m working on a post on behavioural economics and psychology with respect to diamond hands, particularly in the event of a squeeze. I aim to post it before market open on Monday.

❤️, 🦍💎🙌
