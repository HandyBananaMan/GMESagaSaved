<p>Yes, FOMO.  People outside of our community are starting hearing of the upcoming 1mil share, hedge fund collapse and are going to pile in to get a hold of some magic.  This has not been talked of in the DDs.  Once this rocket is starting the launch sequence, then the general population is going to try and grab on like this is the last helo out of Saigon.  Cant wait for this accelerant to be poured on the rocket thrust.  Look at it like an additional atomic engine on the rocket</p>
