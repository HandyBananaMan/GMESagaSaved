‚ÄúThe Bomb Idea‚Äù

Melvin, Shitadel, and all other cucks shorting $GME could possibly be running low on liquidity and ideas to try and get us to sell, **why ban u/rensole and u/redchessqueen99** on a *weekend* the day before market opens? 

Here‚Äôs my assumption: the incredible April 1st joke by the DTCC passing the 005 ruling (oh wait it **WASN‚ÄôT an April fools joke**) - essentially a TLDR for those who are unaware of what DTC-2021-005 is:

**‚ÄùHedge funds would no longer be able to hide their positions by abusing call option ITM trading‚Äù**

**Hedgefunds are hiding their positions using complex options strategies.**

This is essentially putting an end to them being able to kick the can down the road. 

Up next? We have the DTC-2021-801 ruling we have all been waiting oh so patiently for to be approved...

**NSCC-801 TL;DR** ‚Äî ‚ÄúWe will use the position reports received via DTC-003 to calculate if it is necessary for you to contribute a supplementary liquidity deposit due to your positional risk. Furthermore, if multiple members have supplemental liquidity obligations in excess of $2B each, we can decide if it‚Äôs all on them, or if it should be split up pro rata among all members.‚Äù

What is DTC-2021-003?

**DTC-003 TL;DR** ‚Äî ‚ÄúReport your positions on a daily basis. Furthermore, liabilities arising from the misreporting of positions fall solely on the misreporting party.‚Äù


Now, you‚Äôre sitting there, crayon in mouth wondering how this is a ticking time bomb set to go off, ü¶ç no worry, ü¶ç explain how this üöÄ is about to rip üçë cheeks and have a diarrhea explosion all over Ken and Melvins face while a ginormous green dildo impales their short cheeky position from MACS0647-JD (*farthest galaxy from earth*).

There is still yet to hear Papa Cohen announce himself as CEO. u/DeepFuckingValue has 500 $12 call contracts waiting to be exercised. GameStop is still severely undervalued from a fundamental standpoint as it has completely revised its board members and transitions into e-commerce. GME Annual Shareholder meeting (AGM) + Recalling the shares is still on the table. **40,732** put options expiring 04/09 at the current price ($191.50) and **387,502** put options expiring 4/16 at current price as well as **34,684** call options currently ITM. 

**This is their last chance to try and divide us**

They will no longer be able to hide FTDs, they have no power over our psychology by trying to spread bullshit FUD, we are unphased by any dip as they are amazing ü¶ç discounts for future tendies, Ken was dumb enough to admit how retail owns the float.....want proof? [Here ](https://washingtonnewspost.com/news/business/citadels-griffin-warns-of-inflation-risk-to-markets-enjoying-retail-trading-boom/)

‚ÄúThe fact that the tweet of an ice cream cone can move markets will be the subject of academic study for years,‚Äù Griffin said. ‚ÄúIt represents a dynamic where **certain stocks are now almost exclusively owned by retail and passive funds.** You‚Äôve taken out active investors who focus on traditional metrics in valuing an equity.‚Äù

Fear not fellow apes, for the squeeze has yet to be squoze and the wick on this bomb is coming incredibly close to going off in Ken and Melvins face. Stay strong, keep HODLing and if you somehow have paper hands, ask yourself: *why are they trying so hard to stray everyone away from this? The media, hedge funds, and shills don‚Äôt have your best interest, want [proof?](https://youtu.be/-6u1kG7yuy4)

Now sit back, jerk one to the thought of your future waifu sitting in your lambo as you raid a Wendy‚Äôs for those precious tendies.

**TLDR: HEDGIES FUKD, IM HARD, BUY AND HODL**
