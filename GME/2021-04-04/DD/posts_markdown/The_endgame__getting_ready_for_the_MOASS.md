In chess, you can lose everything if you mess up your endgame. I believe we are now in the endgame following Kenny G‚Äôs announcement of a coming ‚Äúdoomsday scenario‚Äù in the FT last **Sunday 28 March**. He told everyone to get ready, so apes have to get ready too. This means getting all your affairs in order, tying up any loose ends and monitoring the signs of the MOASS as it approaches.

I want to thank everyone who has followed me. Your follows and all the awards, karma and kind words really mean a lot. This experience has been very new for me and I wouldn‚Äôt have kept digging and learned all the things I know now without your encouragement, **you big apes**. For anyone not following me, here is a timeline of my key posts. Each post builds on the next one like one long red line to create a big picture, so it might be difficult to understand my endgame if you have missed previous posts. I have included confirmation of my theory in the MSM and even by Kenny G himself.

# The gold price

I noted in my post on **31 March** that on that day the gold price was starting to rally that very same day.

Here is the gold price today, **Sunday, 4 April 2021**.

I subscribe to the newsletter of **GoldMoney**. Here is what they said on **2 April 2021**:

![\\"Turnaround in hedge fund net longs\\"](https://preview.redd.it/xmsn5766u7r61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb354dcf8618ed1db0b7fc18a8bab30b8c0d229d)

**TLDR and my (speculative) interpretation:** Bullion banks and hedge funds have suddenly reversed their long-held short positions in gold and are now positioning to be net long and to trade a rising gold price. What does this mean? Normally gold is not a popular investment asset because it does not generate an income and it costs you to hold it. Its value is as an **insurance policy** against a worst-case scenario market disaster. Like any insurance policy, it costs you a bit to maintain it. And the earlier you buy your insurance before you actually need it, the cheaper it is. Remember that hedge funds have to trade on leverage to generate a high return and to justify their high fees. There is no reason for them ‚Äì in any **normal** situation ‚Äì to be long gold. But after Kenny G announced ‚Äúdoomsday‚Äù? It would make sense. At least to this ape. But what do I know.

# Eurodollar futures

GoldMoney supports the ‚Äúinflation‚Äù story, as does Kenny G officially. For an alternative interpretation, watch Jeff and Emil on their YouTube:

**TLDR:** This is ***very technical*** stuff. Take your time with it. Banks are able, in effect, to print US dollars outside of the US through their lending activities. US dollars held offshore, in any country outside of the US, are called **Eurodollars**. There are historical reasons for this name. Don‚Äôt worry about the ‚ÄúEuro‚Äù part. It has nothing to do with euros. No one has counted how many Eurodollars there are.

Basically, Emil and Jeff are saying that the Eurodollar futures market is indicating that the really smart and the really big money (*Emil says that Reddit hasn‚Äôt taken over Eurodollar futures yet* ü§£) are not anticipating inflation. They also say that there is generally a shortage of collateral everywhere. **AKA where are the shares?** They say that the shorts on Treasuries would normally not imbalance the market, but because of the risk and the requirement of collateral, the shorts are creating an imbalance. Please watch their videos and support them. I can't summarise it all here and they can explain better than me.

# Your broker

Make sure you have no loose ends with your broker. If you are in the US, check with your broker that your account is protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("**SIPC**"). This will entitle you to a maximum coverage of **$500,000**. The problem with broker-dealers is that they tend to be structured in the form of many interconnected affiliates, many of them in an **offshore jurisdiction**. If a customer's funds or securities are located in an offshore entity at the time of failure, they will not be covered by the SIPC.

Good night and good luck in the market. As a Europoor I will be sitting out the market on Easter Monday. The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, US OTC markets and bond markets and the Toronto Stock Exchange will be open on Easter Monday. The London Stock Exchange and markets in Germany and France will be closed on Easter Monday. Shanghai Stock Exchange will be closed for Qingming Festival. Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be closed Monday and Tuesday.

**NB:** the beta of GME went from **-4.09** against the Dow Jones before the long Easter weekend to **-9.59** today, Easter Sunday. *They did something huge over Easter weekend.*
