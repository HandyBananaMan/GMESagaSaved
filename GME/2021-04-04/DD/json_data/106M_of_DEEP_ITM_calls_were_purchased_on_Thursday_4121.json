    "selftext": "Happy Easter Apes,\n\nThe folks at PHLX are back at it again with massive DEEP ITM call purchases before close\n\n[GME Biggest Trades 4-4-2021](https://preview.redd.it/kqts0fdcf8r61.jpg?width=1222&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4fc1040a414ebc4e5663647038da913ad1d33c8)\n\nAs you can see from the data above a buyer out of PHLX bought $106 million of these DEEP ITM calls at 1:22pm and 3:29pm totaling 5960 calls at assorted strike prices ($12-20). These is a pretty massive purchase and it is my belief they made be using these to hide FTD's (Failed-to-deliver). These all expire 4/16/2021 leading me to believe the next few weeks we will see heightened volatility as we near the quarter's hottest expiry date (4/16). With some potential major catalysts looming things are definitely getting pretty spicy.\n\nToday I eat ~~ramen~~ crayons so I will one day eat banana",
