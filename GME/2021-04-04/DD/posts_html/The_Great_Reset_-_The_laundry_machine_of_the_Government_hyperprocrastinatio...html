<p>Disclaimer: This not my style. Skip this whole part entirely and just go down to enjoy your bullish DD on GME below, because anything hereafter is just my stomach turning around. &gt;!And thatÂ´s it. I literally want to stop writing at this point. I even considered how I phrase this. This is the beginning of this DD and I have no strength left. ItÂ´s not even due to GME, for the curious ApeÂ´s that couldnÂ´t follow my advice, but no matter how much I Ape this down, use Emojis you all like or idk what stuff you would like to see, but this topic...idk. I am currently sitting in front of my PC and I hope I am delusional, because I am realizing a scheme that shouldnÂ´t exist. And I donÂ´t mean naked shorting. Every dot I input is literally me taking a break.!&lt;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I will now level the playingfield with basics, that should have never been hidden. That should have been taught in school <strong>every day</strong> until you can preach it.</p>
<p>Hidden behind a network of institutions, numbers, words, terms, silence and individuals.</p>
<p>And the inter-connection how I.O.U. beyond the existing shares availability of GME at previously confirmed 140% being shorted is sanding the whole system. So letÂ´s begin.</p>
<p>You probably heard from this as statistics, but I will make you now realize just how small this 0.01% is.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/yz9d6j7od5r61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7b52120d0800cfe2d3b7ea5e7911961f3d026f9</p>
<p>Technically speaking, as ridiculous as this may sound, the difference between poor and rich is much smaller than the abyss separating the top 0.1% from the stupendously wealthy 0.01%.</p>
<p>Just to put this into perspective. I have some more graphs, but I guess you can imagine how this accumulates from hundreds of years, just to be passed on to your child, or here - close to 50 years in this case, before we even had the tools to map this.</p>
<p><strong>Which is only what we can see I should stress.</strong></p>
<p>Sounds ridiculous? Then letÂ´s zoom in.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/t8a2i37pd5r61.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b699e6f5630b8fdf58c20dc7e4354764037a5f</p>
<p>Now then, <strong>who belongs to these 0.01%? Numbers are uninteresting, we like</strong> ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>Well to be frank, no one knows. I refered to this in a previous comment, but while the boards and names of some banks are visible, some individuals - you are not even allowed to post pictures from, because you never receive the license to do so.</p>
<p><strong>They are a myth, like Randall Smith from Alden Global Capital. But there are some, who are so plainly hidden in sight.</strong></p>
<p>And thatÂ´s the government and the banks.</p>
<p>You donÂ´t believe me?? Well, what if I told you the Federal Reserve is just a fancy name for the Central Bank and is owned by Stock Holders?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/65rx089qd5r61.png?width=1247&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d2f36344ec59fb48e42ae3ddfba19c0087b8e6</p>
<p>"However, owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company."</p>
<p><strong>Man I wish I could read, because owning a stock, does not make you an owner apparently. I know, right? Would be a shame if it comes to light, that your actual share is just an I.O.U. that doesnÂ´t exist and that the Fed is a privately owned company.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- I mean nah, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>And thatÂ´s the sad truth. Money is not money. And sometimes even securities are not securities. These are all just fancy names for I.O.U.s.</strong></p>
<p>Sounds familiar? <a href="https://youtu.be/xbRZE64S3U4?t=63">https://youtu.be/xbRZE64S3U4?t=63</a></p>
<p>Any paper you hold in your hand is made-up. We just rely on each other that it has value, but in reality, due to <strong>naked shorting the money supply by relentlessly printing vast amounts</strong>, the value of $, â‚¬, Â£ and Â¥ drops <strong>and the price of commodities adjusts to fit this reality</strong>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/rf866rhsd5r61.png?width=3273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3f7deeb1d620740ce452d103996a1ce746c1e2</p>
<p><strong>ThatÂ´s why everything is getting more expensive.</strong> Forget houses, you can be lucky, if you can afford children, at least with a sane consciousness, releasing them into this kind of world, because they are guarenteed to stem our debt. This is hyperprocrastination at itÂ´s finest. Students may be called out procrastinating, but everyone was literally watching the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world procrastinating every picosecond of their life.</p>

<p><strong>And itÂ´s not only physical currency, but also the one inputted digit*lly.</strong></p>
<p>Banks amplify this effect by loaning you money for I.O.U.s, <strong>while this very I.O.U.</strong> is then used to <strong>loan out the I.O.U for a Loan for an I.O.U.</strong>, which I will refer to as L.I.O.U. for ease.</p>
<p><strong>Which is more commonly known as  "Fractional Reserve Banking"</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp</a></p>
<p><strong>In other words the bank is only required to hold onto 10%, 5% or 3% of your initial 10$, which is 1$.</strong></p>
<p>And this is really simplified, your initial $10 Loan has now turned into the 10$ of another person for another person, that puts it back into their <strong>digit*l</strong> bank account, just to be loaned out again.</p>
<p>By the time you read this, your 10$ may have already inflated into quadruple digits. ThatÂ´s how inflated the whole money supply is. It only takes seconds for $10 to turn into $1000. And all it requires is one click.</p>
<p>This is not even accounting the Federal Reserve, or respectively the Central bank in each nation. This is only the bank you and I frequent. This whole system and its numbers are made-up. <strong>Physically and digita*lly. Nothing backs them.</strong></p>
<p>And the reason why Oil is plummeting is not only because the demand for it is decreasing. Oil is backed by Dollar and if Dollar loses value, pray that your Oil holds you above water.</p>
<p>But ohh dear, this pandemic made Oil tank too - good night.</p>
<p><strong>Short excursion, because I want you to realize something which is just as important for anything you will do in the future. Anything (Oil) that is backed by someting ($) requires you to convert your Currency (â‚¬, Â£, Â¥) i</strong>nto the one that backs it ($).</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because this gives the country, who backs a commodity, that is needed for everything - the ability to track the flow of money.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I hope you expand this on any system. Because we currently have dec**tral**ed currencies too, but once they are central**ed, thatÂ´s it. But thatÂ´s just my humble opinion. Clearly it is more beneficial to join this debt driven system.</strong></p>
<p>And this whole system just happens to be the monopoly of banks, who can dictate their own <strong>borrowing fees</strong>, have their own clearing houses (self-clearing), own black pools and influence the liquidity of the real world.</p>

<p>Just for M1, M2, M3, MZM, the indicators to track money supply in the economy, to be discontinued right after they skyrocketed or should I say that the chart was "re-adjusted"</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyways. I said debt driven, but this actually has a name. <strong>It is called Deficit spending in political terms and it is what links banks with the Government together.</strong></p>
<p>Now here is the thing. <strong>The debt of your country. Your debt. Is a metric for the Bonds, that are issued to fund "Political promises".</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/zohqe56wd5r61.png?width=2122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36726078206cc0ca92a24d05da95271e965f64df</p>
<p><strong>You thought Kenny was kicking down the can? Kenny would have loved to be a part of it, but the big boii club didnÂ´t grant him the status.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/citadel-chief-gives-up-dream-for-investment-bank/">https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/citadel-chief-gives-up-dream-for-investment-bank/</a></p>
<p>In other words, every project and especially wasted ones, that costs tax money, creates future money (I.O.U.s), that has to be paid off by future labour work, your children, to become net neutral. $0.</p>
<p>Because to fund these promises the treasury issues bonds.</p>
<p><strong>But what is a bond, you may ask? It is just an I.O.U. for future labour work.</strong></p>
<p>Because like a loan, it piles interest.</p>
<p>10$ loan turns into 10$ + 1$ Interest.</p>
<p>So someone promises someone that he will repay them in the future with money that shouldnÂ´t exist. Through labour that does not exist. See why Japan is advertising baby making so heavily?</p>
<p><strong>Every country is drowned in debt to the max, because more money than exists is put up as I.O.U.</strong></p>
<p>Even imaginary numbers scramble, when Debt enters the fray.</p>
<p>And for convenience sake I will just create my own logo for it. Because if the government can create fake Money, which should be called <strong>currency that is backed by nothingness</strong>, yet never stresses the importance of it or prepares pupils for the real world out there. Then I can make up stuff too.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/rueietixd5r61.png?width=164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0784bf1c313194127751ff4fd853b0290e1af82f"> My own Debt Denomination Logo  </a></p>
<p>So what you need to understand is that bonds are our national debt, which works the same everywhere (worldwide) and these I.O.U.s will be paid by the public, everyone who is taxed (Tax Havens make a whole lot more sense now).</p>
<p><strong>In other words, the future is deprived of its wealth and debt is hyperprocrastinated onto generations, that have yet to come.</strong></p>
<p>We are basically living on the backs of our children, your very children you are looking into the eyes, which I hope makes you understand the scope of this and why my stomach is turning inside out.</p>
<p>I spared everyone, who listened to my advice above, but this goes much deeper. We are not even on the same page yet.</p>
<p>So I was asked how this correlates to GME</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/t45f8xgzd5r61.png?width=929&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99aead5783bd8a27f5bdbcece8ff8926e4d9c8c</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And the thing you have to understand, which is why I was able to quench that last fraction of disbelief I held onto, since months</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/6g4nrui0e5r61.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc48386755f25d35d2b55d92b70eed5ffd8efaf9</p>
<p>Is now that I am certain, that the government is collaborating in this whole mess. That there is literally no way to aid any bank, Hedge Fund or short seller, who overexposed themself and were tempted, also due to the pandemic, to give loans on already leveraged I.O.U.s, through their monopolies. <strong>They even might be into it too, if they start to extend a hand any further, than decreasing the security transactions fee from 22.10$ to 5.10$ to pave the way for a market sell-off (Market Crash)</strong></p>

<p>They have no time for some puny Market Maker. They have to save their very own face.</p>

<p>Which is why I am speculating that news agencies around the world are silent.</p>
<p>And as I said</p>

<p>If you choose to believe me is entirely up to you. The scale is so large in my mind, that any number you input for your GME share is absolutely feaseable.</p>
<p>This is not any longer something you can put into numbers even, but what I can guarentee is a f*ckery factor.</p>
<p>They need literally every share, twice, thrice or tenfold in my mind. These I.O.U. have so much power behind them, amplified by so many factors, that even I am not pessimistic enough to project the landscape hereafter.</p>
<p>Do whatever you want with this information and whoever can tl;dr this will receive an award from me.</p>
<p>Go out and prove me wrong, go out and learn, go out and tell me that shareholders of the Fed are something entirely different, or just go out, because thatÂ´s what I will do. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/crypto4killz/">u/crypto4killz</a> released the cat out of the bag - since some time now, I should add.  Surely dividends arenÂ´t dividends either, because why call dividends dividends, if you are not the owner of a stock</p>
