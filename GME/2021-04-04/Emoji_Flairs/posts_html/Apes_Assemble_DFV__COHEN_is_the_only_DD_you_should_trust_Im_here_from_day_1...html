<p>Whether it is r/Gme or r/wsb it doesn’t matter where we stand and fight. We have shills/paid stock bashers among us but they are few in numbers. The more we are closer to winning the more we can expect such dramas. Don’t quit any subs but join as much as you want. We make every base strong, and we protect each of the base every single day. BUY &amp; HODL TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
