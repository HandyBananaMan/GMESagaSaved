<p>Hold fast.  A true journey is one where you leave to find the answers, only to find you had the answers the whole time. <strong>Buy and Hold.</strong> </p>
<p>Edit. To anyone advertising other subs, I don’t give a fuck! Keep it to yourself, follow or not, it doesn’t matter to me. Thanks! I could leave Reddit right now and be fine with just the ticker because my job is simple. <strong>Buy and hold</strong>. <strong>The focus isn’t about any sub or mod</strong>. <strong>If people are telling you to join this or that when you have all the dd and know the fundamentals, ask yourself why.</strong> Especially when <strong>we own the float</strong> and you could let everyone else sell and they would <strong>STILL</strong> have to <strong>buy your share at YOUR price</strong>. J<strong>ust ask yourself why</strong>. <strong>Don’t get caught up in drama and lose focus on what’s actually important. Which is and has always been GME.</strong></p>
