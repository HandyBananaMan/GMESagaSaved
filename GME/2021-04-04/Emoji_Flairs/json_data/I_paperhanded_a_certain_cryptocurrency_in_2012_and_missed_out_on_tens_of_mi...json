I\u2019m still a little bitch but I won\u2019t make the same mistake again.\n\nEdit: for those that are wondering, I held over 1,000 coins of this cryptocurrency and sold in 2012 for around $12.00 each. I doubled my initial investment from it and the profit was substantial for a me as a first year college student. Even then I knew the bull case for the price going into the thousands, but I couldn\u2019t really believe it and decided to sell. The coin is now a cool 5000X at around ~$60,000 each...\n\nI believe in the near future you will have people from the \u201cgeneral population\u201d saying \u201cMan, can you imagine if I had bought GME when it was at $200 a share?\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t believe I sold GME when it hit $1,000.\u201d Don\u2019t be that guy or gal.",
