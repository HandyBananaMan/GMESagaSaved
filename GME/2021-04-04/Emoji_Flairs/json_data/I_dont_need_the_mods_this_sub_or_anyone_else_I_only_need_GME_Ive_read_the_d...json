To anyone advertising other subs, I don\u2019t give a fuck! Keep it to yourself, follow or not, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. Thanks! I could leave Reddit right now and be fine with just the ticker because my job is simple. **Buy and hold**. **The focus isn\u2019t about any sub or mod**. **If people are telling you to join this or that when you have all the dd and know the fundamentals, ask yourself why.** Especially when **we own the float** and you could let everyone else sell and they would **STILL** have to **buy your share at YOUR price**.
