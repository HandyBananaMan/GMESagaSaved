Conviction in the DD and patience will be rewarded. I’m still a little bitch but I won’t make the same mistake again.

Edit: for those that are wondering, I held over 1,000 coins of this cryptocurrency and sold in 2012 for around $12.00 each. I doubled my initial investment from it and the profit was substantial for a me as a first year college student. Even then I knew the bull case for the price going into the thousands, but I couldn’t really believe it and decided to sell. The coin is now a cool 5000X at around ~$60,000 each...

I believe in the near future you will have people from the “general population” saying “Man, can you imagine if I had bought GME when it was at $200 a share?” or “I can’t believe I sold GME when it hit $1,000.” Don’t be that guy or gal.
