Hold fast.  A true journey is one where you leave to find the answers, only to find you had the answers the whole time. **Buy and Hold.** 

Edit. To anyone advertising other subs, I don’t give a fuck! Keep it to yourself, follow or not, it doesn’t matter to me. Thanks! I could leave Reddit right now and be fine with just the ticker because my job is simple. **Buy and hold**. **The focus isn’t about any sub or mod**. **If people are telling you to join this or that when you have all the dd and know the fundamentals, ask yourself why.** Especially when **we own the float** and you could let everyone else sell and they would **STILL** have to **buy your share at YOUR price**. J**ust ask yourself why**. **Don’t get caught up in drama and lose focus on what’s actually important. Which is and has always been GME.**
