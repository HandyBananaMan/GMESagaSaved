<p>HODL. DIAMOND HANDS. 🙌🏼💎🚀🦍</p>
<p>The mixture of all of r/GME’s and r/wallstreetbets’s incredible DD, these two movies, u/deepfuckingvalue‘s April 16 call options, the new trading rules, and a potential recall on shorts from Ryan Cohen has me ready to run a rampage on these hedgies more than ever. </p>
<p>DIAMOND HANDS boys and girls. 
DIAMOND HANDS. </p>
<p>Valhalla shall come, Rome wasn’t conquered in a day. 
Stay vigilant, for the Tendieman shall come soon. </p>
<p>Buy and HODL. 
My trust in you fellow apes has never been stronger. 
We are the hedgie’s worst nightmare and it’s all going to blowup in their faces very soon. </p>
<p>Stay patient and don’t sell until you see atleast 20,000,000 a share. </p>
<p>Trust the DD and the facts. Not your emotions! 
Don’t fall victim to the FUD, that is what THEY WANT. </p>
<p>DO NOT CELEBRATE UNTIL THIS IS FINISHED. </p>
