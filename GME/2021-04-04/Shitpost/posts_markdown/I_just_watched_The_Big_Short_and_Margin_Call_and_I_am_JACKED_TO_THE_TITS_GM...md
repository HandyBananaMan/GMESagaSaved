HODL. DIAMOND HANDS. 🙌🏼💎🚀🦍

The mixture of all of r/GME’s and r/wallstreetbets’s incredible DD, these two movies, u/deepfuckingvalue‘s April 16 call options, the new trading rules, and a potential recall on shorts from Ryan Cohen has me ready to run a rampage on these hedgies more than ever. 

DIAMOND HANDS boys and girls. 
DIAMOND HANDS. 

Valhalla shall come, Rome wasn’t conquered in a day. 
Stay vigilant, for the Tendieman shall come soon. 

Buy and HODL. 
My trust in you fellow apes has never been stronger. 
We are the hedgie’s worst nightmare and it’s all going to blowup in their faces very soon. 

Stay patient and don’t sell until you see atleast 20,000,000 a share. 

Trust the DD and the facts. Not your emotions! 
Don’t fall victim to the FUD, that is what THEY WANT. 

DO NOT CELEBRATE UNTIL THIS IS FINISHED. 

u/KingAethelking explains how the MOASS is the sequel to ‘The Big Short’.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I just really like the fucking stock.
