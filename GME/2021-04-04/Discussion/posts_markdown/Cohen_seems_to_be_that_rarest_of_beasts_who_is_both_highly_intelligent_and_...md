I’ve seen a lot of posts and articles saying Cohen wouldn’t do a share offering because he doesn’t want to dilute his own position.

Well, I don’t think he’ll do a share offering but it’s for a different reason. It’s because he’s highly intelligent but rather than being a psychopath, like many business leaders, he’s empathetic and caring. He loves his customers and it’s becoming more obvious by the day that he loves his shareholders too.

Those comments saying Cohen wouldn’t do the share offering because it would negatively affect him are projections. They’re observations from people who are themselves selfish and narcissistic, who only think about their own wants and needs even to the detriment of others, and who can only imagine that everyone around them shares their same motivations.

Well, I think we have a leader on our hands who’s better than that. A leader who has proven himself to be a business genius, an Amazon slayer, but who has also proven himself to be a caring person who goes the extra mile to delight his customers. And not just so that he can make a buck, but because he believes it’s the right thing to do.

The future is bright apes! It’s clear to anyone paying attention that Cohen is running the show behind the scenes, and from what I’ve seen so far there’s no one I’d rather have at the helm. It’s someone who has the best of both, a killer instinct for business and a loving instinct for people and customers. What can I say, love the company, love the stock, love the management team being assembled, bit of a man crush on our boy Cohen. Great time to be a GME investor.

Edit: Welp, this didn’t age very well. But if I’m understanding it correctly what they’re doing is basically setting themselves up for the right to sell shares already in their treasury, for a max of 3.5 million shares and max profit of 1 billion. If they offer these shares during the squeeze in order to gain a cool billion for the transformation I’ll be happy as a clam with that outcome. Just didn’t want them to dilute me while shares were trading at ‘normal’ levels and looks like that’s not the play so game on!
