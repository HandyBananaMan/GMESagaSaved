    "selftext": "Okay so you may have seen this news of FB data leak recently.\n https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4\n\nWhat's interesting is this has occurred years ago but why now and what could this cause. There's a high chance that FB crashes on market open \"due to these headlines\" but what if someone wants to liquidating their FB position without arising suspicion. We all know who loves media headlines, the shorties so I decided to look further\n\n*look under 13F holdings*\nMelvin (2nd top position 1.2B in FB)\nhttps://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp\n Citadel ($852M in FB, 3rd top stock position ignoring options although note 3.8B in FB calls rank #9)\nhttps://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link\n\nCoincidence I think not.\n\nEdit: To clarify on my speculation why the shorts would make this \"news\" pop up on their holdings. Is that the market would have already have adjusted this information to be reflects in FBs price but a new dip on monday would be from these liquidating positions.\n\nEdit2: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up this much. Take it will a grain of salt as there is no definitive connection linking the 2. I just finished my other post which I think adds more value basically detailing how GME is shifting to higher-margin goods, give it a read if you are bored https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mk3bi9/a_look_into_the_wrinkly_brain_that_is_rc/",
