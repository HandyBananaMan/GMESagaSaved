    "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts and articles saying Cohen wouldn\u2019t do a share offering because he doesn\u2019t want to dilute his own position.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do a share offering but it\u2019s for a different reason. It\u2019s because he\u2019s highly intelligent but rather than being a psychopath, like many business leaders, he\u2019s empathetic and caring. He loves his customers and it\u2019s becoming more obvious by the day that he loves his shareholders too.\n\nThose comments saying Cohen wouldn\u2019t do the share offering because it would negatively affect him are projections. They\u2019re observations from people who are themselves selfish and narcissistic, who only think about their own wants and needs even to the detriment of others, and who can only imagine that everyone around them shares their same motivations.\n\nWell, I think we have a leader on our hands who\u2019s better than that. A leader who has proven himself to be a business genius, an Amazon slayer, but who has also proven himself to be a caring person who goes the extra mile to delight his customers. And not just so that he can make a buck, but because he believes it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nThe future is bright apes! It\u2019s clear to anyone paying attention that Cohen is running the show behind the scenes, and from what I\u2019ve seen so far there\u2019s no one I\u2019d rather have at the helm. It\u2019s someone who has the best of both, a killer instinct for business and a loving instinct for people and customers. What can I say, love the company, love the stock, love the management team being assembled, bit of a man crush on our boy Cohen. Great time to be a GME investor.\n\nEdit: Welp, this didn\u2019t age very well. But if I\u2019m understanding it correctly what they\u2019re doing is basically setting themselves up for the right to sell shares already in their treasury, for a max of 3.5 million shares and max profit of 1 billion. If they offer these shares during the squeeze in order to gain a cool billion for the transformation I\u2019ll be happy as a clam with that outcome. Just didn\u2019t want them to dilute me while shares were trading at \u2018normal\u2019 levels and looks like that\u2019s not the play so game on!",
