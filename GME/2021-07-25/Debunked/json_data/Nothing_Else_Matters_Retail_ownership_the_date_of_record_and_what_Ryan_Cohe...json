    "selftext": "Did you think this was going to be easy? A quick in-and-out to make a few bucks? How did we end up here?\n\n**TADR** The only thing that matters is how many shares retail holds today. RC and GameStop know what retail held on April 15th. Nothing else matters.  \n\n\n**A Brief Recollection of Events**\n\nThe January run-up was beautiful with a pre-market spike flying past the meme of $420.69 with no resistance. $1,000 was a forgone conclusion and $10,000 wasn\u2019t a meme at that point. The tension was palpable, there was euphoria, how high was it going to go? FOMO buyers were salivating for market to open.\n\nEveryone knows how that played out, but the truth of what happened behind the scenes remains murky and there seems to be [conflicting testimony on who pulled the plug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0CSzev8T4Q)\nwhich remains unaddressed to this day. \n\n[Despite Vlad and Michael Bodson re-enacting the spiderman meme](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/273/942/c29.jpg), the buying restrictions on January 27th was a coordinated move by several intermediaries to protect the clearing houses and the financial institutions as stated by Thomas Peterffy in this interview: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html\n\nRegardless of who made the call to cut retail trading, many important events took place in the following days. As \u2018I\u2019m not selling\u2019 echoed through the hottest subreddit at the time, GME was hammered down and somehow the SI dropped at the same time. \n\nThe financial world was hoping that the GME situation would resolve with the usual [hedge fund playbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r07Gg92YjOI) of bad press, rapid drop in price, low valuations, and moving on to the newest hot ticker. You know, the normal FUD that worked on dumb money for ages. Silver Shills appeared. Everything was a short squeeze. When that did not work, they got together and tried to figure out what kids these days like. \n\nWeed? \n\nRockets? \n\nIf only Chiquita was a publicly traded company\u2026\n\nIt was not clear how everything happened at the time. Some apes sold their shares in disappointment while many HODLed or even bought during February. Many more bought after the first GameStock congressional hearing and the infamous DFV double-down. $40/share became unsustainable for whoever was holding the price down and the narrative of the overvalued dying company did not stick to the Teflon minds of the apes.\n\nThe rise to $350 in March may have been part retail and part psychology experiment to exploit bagholder sentiments followed by the flash crash to $180 that would panic the typical dumb money investor. It failed miserably as apes slurped up the dips. Price stabilized again.\n\nThose with the most wrinkles have since uncovered some of the methods to manipulate the stock and hide FTDs like \n[ETF manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ll5t0l/new_ftd_data_is_out/ ), [deep ITM calls immediately being exercised](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m31f8b/2day_update_168_million_on_6650_deep_itm_calls/), Married Puts, and [that spike in far OTM \\(aka worthless\\) options](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/on9fnx/otm_puts_are_the_passed_puck_of_short_positions/). The legality of these actions range from technically legal to illegal, but after all, GG has only been on the job for 14 weeks. All this effort shows that shorts did not ~~cover~~ close their position.\n\n\n**The Date of Record**\n\nEverything before that time only mattered insofar as who owned the stock on April 15. April 15th is the most important date in this saga because there is a legal record of shareholders and how many shares they each held. Apes spent every day from after that until the shareholder meeting trying to get to vote. Unprecedented numbers of foreign brokers were forced to address the demands of the retail investor and either allow them to vote or submit a broker non-vote.\n\nI hate to bring up the movie stock, but it is important to understand what they have publicly stated so that we have an idea of what GameStop knows. Unlike GameStop, they have directly acknowledged, addressed, and quantified the positions of retail investors. The CEO that does interviews in tighty-whities made several tweets, both after their first record date in March and after the most recent record date in June stating the number of shareholders. Importantly, this statement was made as a press release:\n\n[SEC filing of the Press Release](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/127898eb-50b0-4d20-b217-e070c9e64f10.pdf) \n\nNotice three important facts in this statement:\n \n1.\tThey know how many shareholders there were based on information from their proxy intermediaries: 4.1 million individual shareholders eligible to vote\n2.\tThey know that retail investors hold around 120 shares each\n3.\tThey know the percent of shares that retail investors hold (>80%)\n\nQuick side math\n\n    4.1m individual shareholders * 120 shares each = 492m shares\n\nJust under 502m shares were outstanding on the date of record, which means that retail owned just under the shares outstanding. But since something like 20% of the movie ticker was shorted, there was another 100 million synthetic longs in the system\n\n    492m retail shares / (502m shares outstanding + 100m synthetic longs) = 81.7% or almost exactly what was stated in the press release.\n\n**Back to our favorite stock** \u2013 If the movie theater knows that information, GameStop and RC know it too. If the popcorn stock made a press release, it implies that GameStop could too. But why have they not released that information when they [clearly know we exist](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1413223954387406851?)? Why [wink and nod at us](https://www.shacknews.com/article/124331/gamestop-twitter-account-tweets-about-gme-short-squeeze)  instead of offering us a free popcorn like the movie theater did? \n\nMy guess is they are legally prevented from doing so because the retail ownership was way over the shares outstanding. This would indicate a number of issues that would require an ongoing investigation into naked shorting, Reg SHO, improper short interest filings to FINRA, and other creative accounting tactics. Sure, an investigation into these types of fraud would take time, but the resultant [fines will surely be massive and lead to much jail time](https://media.giphy.com/media/Fml0fgAxVx1eM/giphy.gif). \n\nThe bottom line is that Retail likely owns more shares than shares outstanding. That was likely the case in January, it was likely true in February, and there should be evidence of it at the record date in April. Since then, do you think that retail ownership went up or down? Was retail selling more than retail buying in weeks leading up to the shareholder meeting? What about afterwards? Weren\u2019t the apes buying the real bananas that GameStop was gifting at a discount with the expectation that the price would rise after they finished their ATM offering?\n\nGameStop retains the ability to determine the number of shareholders again through a variety of methods like a merger, emergency shareholder vote, or an NFT dividend. Or they could wait until next year's record date. \n\n**Peeking Behind the Curtain**\n\nDo you think the big players in the financial industry were just sitting around during the last six months? It\u2019s likely that they were gathering information on shares bought by retail vs shares sold. They collected data on how each price movements in March and April affected retail buys and sells.\n\nThen there was the possibility that the new [Chairman](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1380212953748676608) would play ball. You know, give them a break. Maybe that break was the sale of 8.5 million shares (or about 12% of the shares outstanding at the record date). If the naked shorting was in the realm of reasonable, then those 8.5m shares would have given them a get out of jail free card.\n\nThey also prepared for the inevitable with the creation and shoring up of numerous rules, regulations, and wind down procedures. There have been many DTC, NSCC, and OCC rules were put into place and solid DD into all of them.\n\nUndoubtedly, these banks, institutions, investment firms, market makers, DTC and subsidiaries, *i.e.* **the entire weight of the financial industry** have war gamed every scenario imaginable. These people have access the best financial geniuses, economists, former regulators, data scientists, psychologists, and immense troves of market data. They have likely built simulations on how to unwind their positions and \u2013 even with the new rules \u2013 the outcome was unfathomably horrific. \n\nThus NSCC-2021-010 and NSCC-2021-803 was born.\n\nI am not certain what those filings mean yet, but 300+ pages of legalese that mention naked shorts have me cautiously optimistic that the powers that be have peered into the abyss. Listen to other more wrinkly brained apes than me on this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opuziu/visual_of_the_sft_trades_to_prevent_shorts_andor/ \n\n**Nothing Else Matters** \n\nThe only thing that matters is how many shares are in the hands of retail. All the fuckery, all the posturing, all the fud, shills, mod drama, subreddit sliding, and it does not matter one bit if retail owns more shares than the shares outstanding.\n\nIf retail controls more than the shares outstanding, the powers that be need retail to sell *en masse* for naked positions to be unwound. It is an imminent and existential threat to the system, those who created it, those who profit from it, and those that exploit it. Someone will hold the bag and right now it is everyone from Melvin, Robinhood, Citadel, up to the NSCC and all their members. \n\n[Shall we play a game?](https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/WarGames-Trailer.jpg) \nEnvision a scenario where retail owns 100m shares. That is the equivalent of a paltry 4m GME shareholders (less than the movie stock\u2019s published numbers) owning 25 shares each. That seems like a pretty low bar and less than $5k each at yesterday\u2019s closing price. This would mean that means more than 23m shares would have to be paper-handed, bought by the short institutions, and evaporated to get back to the 77 million GME shares outstanding. At Citadel-approved FUD price of $1000, that is 23b, or about an Archegos disaster. At a mere 10k/share that is a 230b loss the system needs to absorb. This all assumes that institutional ownership is zero, that RC himself has no shares, and that retail does not FOMO in at the last minute. \n\nWhat if the number of shares that need to be pried from diamond hands is more than 23 million? As that number of shares owned by retail increases, so does the average price that needs to be paid as more than just the paperhands will need to sell. Convincing a few out of the loop boomers to sell at $1000 might be possible but prying the 150,420,069th share from a battle-tested January ape will not be cheap. Those numbers become problematic for the system that allowed this to happen.\n\nThere have been some good DD attempts at guessing the number of shareholders and how many shares they each hold. I encourage each of you to do some napkin math and make your best guess. Maybe the new CEO will announce it at some point.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nApes likely own more than the shares outstanding. RC and GameStop know the true number as of April 15th, and I believe that number has increased since then. If this is true, there are a few ways out for the bad actors and their associates:\n\n1. Continue to kick the can down the road in hopes that retail sells *en masse* all while evading any catalyst event (Has not worked so far)\n2. Convince GameStop to issue more shares or otherwise cancel out the naked short position. (They did two ATM offerings and have close to $2 billion on hand. Issuing enough new shares to clear that balance would infuriate shareholders, who happen to be customers too. Would RC burn the very people that allowed GameStop to raise that money by buying shares in those ATM offerings and jumpstart the transition of his investment?)\n\n3. Buy those shares from the apes at the price they demand in the least painful way possible and keep the bag isolated to bad actors\n\nMaybe there is another way for them to squirm out of it, but I do not see it.\n\n\nSo how does this all play out? Your guess is as good as mine, but here are my thoughts:\n\nCurrently, the price is manipulated to remain as low as possible where retail increasing their position is kept at a minimum. Higher volatility and higher prices create a more immediate risk of margin calls and liquidation, particularly with the new rules (if they are enforced). As the price drops it is easier entry and stronger buying power from retail. The low volume in the past week indicates to me that at $180 retail is currently only able to buy small amounts per day but they are not selling either. I think retail bought that dip following the prospectus announcement not knowing how long they had to snatch up the dip, so maybe retail is a bit tapped out at the moment allowing the battle of $180 to happen again....\n\nLong term, RC and the Gamestop team will continue to transition the company into a profitable business. Good news on their end may make the current $180 price unsustainable as was the case in February at $40. RC and the new C-suite must turn the company around, make it profitable in the long run, and a force to be reckoned with in the retail sector. If RC knows of fraud that has harmed shareholder\u2019s values, he must act in the best capacity for GameStop and shareholders and in accordance all the laws and regulations.\n\nThen there is the NFT wild card. It could be part of their long-term business strategy with collectables, used video games, or a platform for transactions. It could also double as a [big red MOASS button](https://static.turbosquid.com/Preview/2020/02/01__08_43_19/big_red_button00.jpgF485D9C9-68B4-4ABB-917D-005D4AE204A9Large.jpg) or issued to shareholders as a \u2018Thank you\u2019 token dividend in test of the NFT system. I am excited about the NFT prospects and I am willing to wait for the new NFT developers to make sure they do it right.\n\n**TADR** The only thing that matters is how many shares retail holds today. RC and GameStop know what retail held on April 15th. Nothing else matters.  \n\nThe hyper-rational ~~predatory~~ ape play has not changed since the beginning. \n\nMy personal strategy is:\n\nBuy if able\n\nHold if unable to buy\n\nIt is not over until the shorts ~~cover~~ close their positions\n\nI believe that if each individual investor that makes the best possible choice for themselves, they also makes the best possible outcome for each other individual investor.\n\n**I leave you with a question: Is the MOASS a self-fulfilling prophecy if enough apes believe it will happen?**\n\n*I am not a financial advisor and offer no advice of any value.
