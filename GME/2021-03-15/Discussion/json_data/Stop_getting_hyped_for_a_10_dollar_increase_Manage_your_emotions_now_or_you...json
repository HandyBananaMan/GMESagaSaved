    "selftext": "Dont get hyped. Get focused. This is not the time to be all over the place with these tiny ups and downs. Everyone screaming diamond hands but when shit gets real you wont have diamond fuck all, IF you cant get a handle on it now.\n\nIm not saying its not a good thing, the increase is fine. There is a loooooooooong way to go and I see all these emotional wrecks freaking out left right and center. You are going to absolutely ruin it for yourself.\n\nCalm the fuck down. Get your emotions in check. Stop watching the fucking ticker for 8 hours straight.\n\n\nI promise its going to get worse, then a lot better, then far more worse before it gets to where it needs to be. I dont think a lot of you can handle it in the fragile mental state you are driving yourself into. Get some food. Get some sleep. Get some perspective.\n\nAnd please, please PLEASE read this. It will help put your mind in the right place for the war that is to come\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzxbzm/be_adamant_some_reminders_for_managing_behavior/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n\nNot financial advice. Just some advice for peace of mind.",
