<p>On Feb 25th Ryan Cohen tweeted a McDonald‚Äôs ice cream cone and a frog emoji. That afternoon GME went up 88%.</p>
<p>He was saying watch the MACD for the leaps.</p>
<p>Last week DFV tweeted Mario in a frog suit finishing world 3 of super Mario 3 with a score over 500,000 and receiving an ice cream cone, then jumping off screen. He had two items in his inventory: a mushroom, and the GME power up power button from their marketing. The mushroom üçÑ makes Mario grow.</p>
<p>He was saying at the end or March (world 3), the MACD will jump, GameStop will grow. What I‚Äôm not sure on is if the 500,000 was the price target, or the volume needed for the leap.</p>
<p>Early this week he tweeted the event horizon from interstellar.</p>
<p>He was saying we‚Äôre past the point of no return, and we‚Äôre going over the edge.</p>
<p>Then he tweeted the gorillaz song with the lyrics ‚ÄúI‚Äôm useless, but not for long, the future, is coming on.‚Äù</p>
<p>He‚Äôs telling us to look out for that MACD jump this week, it‚Äôs time.</p>
<p>Post Script: I know, don‚Äôt set dates. It‚Äôs not my date, I just read the tweets.</p>
<p>Finally let me edit my post! All my DD that I posted in comments in here now:</p>
<p>Edit 1: So I went in to test my theory, and guess what day the MACD took off to start the current runup? Yup. Happened right before his tweet. https://imgur.com/a/mr7sXxc
MACD also spiked just prior to the first run up btw.</p>
<p>Interestingly, VW followed a similar pattern. Showing two big MACD spikes (for GME that would be the late Jan spike, and the one on Feb 25th we're currently in), followed by a huge crash, followed by the squeeze. If my theory on RC and DFV's messages are true, we are here on the VW timeline. https://imgur.com/a/lMs53yX
My theory for the similarity is this: The bumps before the squeeze are the FTD's running into the T+21 walls. If we look at GME in January, the first spike ended exactly 21 days after it began. The shorts were trying to slowly sell all their positions back into the market before the due date so they didn't spike the stock too much. If this is true our current wave will "crash" on the 18th. Yes, crash. I believe the stock will tank again this Thursday according to my model. Also, interestingly the gap between January and February's surge was also 21 days. My thought on why VW had two big bumps before the squeeze is that it took a few waves of ITM options coming due before the short positions couldn't keep up with the exponentiating interest payments anymore and had so many outstanding still that they were called due. They couldn't stop the price from spiking anymore and the brokerages were forced to cover those shorts at any cost per market rules. And the squeeze squoze. This is also why available short shares drop so rapidly before these events. They're literally the ones making the corrections happen, so they're buying up new shorts to try and cover the bad ones. This is why we need to stranglehold the utilization. If we don't we're handing them the shovel to dig themselves out.</p>
<p>"Great, so you're selling now and buying after Thursday, right?" Fuck no! HODL. This will be the biggest FUD week ever. This is the fucking line. If I sell this week, I risk my shot disappearing. The whole thing falls apart if we try to game the system.</p>
<p>1) if we sell, then it just won't fucking squeeze. If we sell, we're handing them the shovel. I'm not selling a fucking thing. I'm buying the dip.</p>
<p>2) You will get left behind if you try to time a violent process which will shoot up 100's of percentage points in a matter of minutes. Possibly even during the pre-market (the brokerage is the one who has to cover all these if Melvin and Shitadel can't) before you can even buy back in. Even if it's in the middle of the day, imagine waiting this long and then realizing it's already at $5k/share and climbing a few thousand dollars every few seconds. We'll send you a postcard from tendie town. F's in chat.</p>
<p>The FUD will be coming for you harder than ever this week to try and put us off the prize. I actually even spent a good bit of time deciding if I should even post this. How fucked up would that be if I was the one fucked the whole squeeze up with unintentional FUD? That's when I realized the actual endgame. I saw what I believe DFV saw, and I glanced the inevitability of it:</p>
<p>Papa Cohen is our Porsche. Remember when he gulped up 9 million shares to get a controlling interest? Well he can't really rebuild a fucking company if multi billion dollar hedgefunds are trying to run it out of bussiness, now can he? He needs the squeeze to squoze so it doesn't drag down everything he's trying to accomplish. He's not toying around with us on twitter because it's fun. He wants our help saving Gamestop.</p>
<p>I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.</p>
<p>Edit 2: More DD:</p>
<p>AMC is also following the exact same MACD cycle, as well as observing the T+21 wall (first AMC spike still had some residual spike after T+21, but that could have been the restrictions clogging up the pipes).</p>

These stocks aren't moving in unison because they're being manipulated... They're tantamount to a dying star, releasing high energy pulses at predictable intervals while the HF's try to use the same covering strategy on both within the T+21 wall.</p>
<p>Edit 3: I am not accusing DFV or RC of anything. They are probably just posting funny things. I am literally interpreting Gifs of people explosively shitting to predict price swings on the NYSE. No one in their right mind would take me seriously. I don't know either of those people personally, nor have I ever spoken to them, or have any confirmation of any intent about anything I'm saying. All I know is Crayons taste better if you put them in your butt first. And if I end up testifying to congress, I hope they have to read this comment out loud.</p>
<p>Edit 4: Playing with the model more, what I'm now calling the MAC &amp; Squeeze (MACD squeezes) seem to peak around the 14th day after the shifts. Both of GME's runups have done it, and so did AMC's first runup. Interestingly though, AMC's second run up seems to have broken that resistance. I don't know if that's a new phase, or just the result of the CEO being very public over the last week, as well as their earnings call happening last week.</p>
