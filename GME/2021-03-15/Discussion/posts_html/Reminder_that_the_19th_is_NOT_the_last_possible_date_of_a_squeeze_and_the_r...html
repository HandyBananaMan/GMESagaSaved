<p>The more we miss those deadlines with EOD prices calls itm the further the squeeze gets pushed out, and the more the even bigger retards paperhand on those dates the even further it'll be.  Buy, hold, be patient, and this is not investment advice.</p>
<p>Edit: Iâ€™d just like to add that I think u/HeyItspixeL and u/rensole predictions on when the gamma squeeze/short squeeze occurs is irresponsible, and r/GME should not be an echo chamber. I am still appreciative of their efforts.</p>

<p>His post where he calls out all the mods of the sub because he dislikes what is and isn't allowed to stay up. </p>
<p>Funny how someone who was once part of the 99% of unknown posters can change their viewpoint so drastically when they become part of the 1%? 
His post broke sub rules and something should be done.</p>
