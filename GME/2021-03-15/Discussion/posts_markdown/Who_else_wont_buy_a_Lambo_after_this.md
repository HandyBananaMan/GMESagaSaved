\*\*The "lambo" is figurative, read the actual post\*\*

I'm not the kind of person who's lifestyle adapts to the money I'm earning, if I take out a million from my GME shares I think I would buy a few hectares of land for biodiversity conservation. What's the point of buying a house and car if  the natural world (which we 100% depend on) is collapsing? Contrarily to many eco-activists, I don't do this just for the sake of saving animals (not that there is anything wrong with that) but mostly out of self interest as without insects we would all die pretty soon. If GME tendies could go to preserving our existence on earth it would be truly great!
