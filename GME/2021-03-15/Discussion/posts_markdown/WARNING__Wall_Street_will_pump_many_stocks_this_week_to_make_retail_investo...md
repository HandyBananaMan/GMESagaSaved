#Title: ⛔ WARNING ⛔ Wall Street will pump many stocks this week to make retail investors think that they are missing out on a rally. Pumping is also a sign before a market crash. I'm just saying so make your own decisions, Not everything that shines in the garbage bin is a diamond.

They probably want you to invest in other stocks while they are pumping them, because they know stimmy money will be floating around. They wanted you to think they are the whales,  but in reality they are the rats. 

This is not a financial advice,  just my opinion under freedom of speech.

Edit: NOT EVERYTHING THAT IS GETTING PUMPED IS GME.
