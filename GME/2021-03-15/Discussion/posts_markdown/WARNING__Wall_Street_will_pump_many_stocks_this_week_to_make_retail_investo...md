They probably want you to invest in other stocks while they are pumping them, because they know stimmy money will be floating around. They wanted you to think they are the whales,  but in reality they are the rats. 

This is not a financial advice,  just my opinion under freedom of speech.

Edit: NOT EVERYTHING THAT IS GETTING PUMPED IS GME.
