"Totally normal. No manipulation at all". Yeah right....

Edit: Wow! Lots of love. Some of the apes didn't even know there was dip. Probably busy looking for bananas. Salute to the true Apes who don't care for these dips anymore!!

Edit 2: Wowwww!! 10K (and counting) up votes!! This ape feels like getting 10K bananas already. Won't even flinch at 10K per share. That ship has sailed longggggg time ago.
