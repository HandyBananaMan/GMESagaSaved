# Title: Attention new GME shareholders, it's very likely we will see a large short attack by HFs in the first half of this week to try and shake shares from new diamond-hands-in-the-making who just bought. Remember not to set any stop loss or limit order sells. That's how they will get you.

This is not financial advice as I am not a financial advisor! Just my personal observations.

Edit: Well that was quick wasn't it? Less than an hour after this post we saw a decent short attack which dropped the price to $223. Hope folks caught the dip! Just goes to show that the price of this stock is almost completely artificial - being driven down by these hedge funds who are getting to the point of desperation that it's cringey. For you newbies, consider yourself initiated (if you held your shares, you are well on your way to being a diamond-handed ape!) and welcome to the rocketship rollercoaster ride to the moon that is GME!

Good news is that the one full-proof counter to all these lame shenanigans is simple: HODL

Again, not financial advice, do your own due diligence and invest carefully as all investing carries risk.

Edit 2: Believe it or not, I thankfully do not work for MarketWatch. I actually, in another recent post, told a couple of their writers, in no uncertain terms, to go fuck themselves. Might be a bit awkward in the office if I worked there (which I assume is located in some lower circle of Hell).
