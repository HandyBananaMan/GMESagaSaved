<p>Listen up:   </p>
<p>A fellow ape u/Vestwak was smart and deep enough to find „WKN A3KM4“</p>

<p>What is that? Why thanks for asking since you seem to miss my headline. <br />
If you are a good ape and do your own research you find, but for those that need it on a diamond platter: </p>

<p>ah the sweetness of it. It tastes like rocket fuel to me. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I feel that my shares are cuddling in bed with me and I will hold them like I hold Melvins wife when I call her over.   </p>
<p>That 600.000.000,00$ will be good enough just for 300 shares sadly. <br />
I do NOT pity the boomer that thinks the return of 3,75% till 2026 is a good deal. Since my guess is, there will not be anything of Shitadel left in 2026 after the thruster blast burst them to the earth core. </p>

<p>I keep HODLING, What about YOU?</p>
<p>Edit: yes, yes... the number there? Yes, you see, I am retarded, I stuck crayons up my $ASS and nose, so here it is: </p>
<p><strong>600,000,000.00$</strong> </p>
<p>And that is 600 Million, not Billion. Sorry to disappoint, but no, that is not <em>that much</em> even if I would like that, but somebody else is going to pay up for your shares.</p>
