Why thanks for asking since you seem to miss my headline.   \nIf you are a good ape and do your own research you find, but for those that need it on a diamond platter: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/hg-bonds-citadel-finance-places-600m-of-notes-in-bond-market-debut-terms-62989441](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/hg-bonds-citadel-finance-places-600m-of-notes-in-bond-market-debut-terms-62989441)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nah the sweetness of it. It tastes like rocket fuel to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel that my shares are cuddling in bed with me and I will hold them like I hold Melvins wife when I call her over.   \n\n\nThat 600.000.000,00$ will be good enough just for 300 shares sadly.   \nI do NOT pity the boomer that thinks the return of 3,75% till 2026 is a good deal. Since my guess is, there will not be anything of Shitadel left in 2026 after the thruster blast burst them to the earth core. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI keep HODLING, What about YOU?\n\nEdit: yes, yes... the number there? Yes, you see, I am retarded, I stuck crayons up my $ASS and nose, so here it is: \n\n**600,000,000.00$** \n\nAnd that is 600 Million, not Billion. Sorry to disappoint, but no, that is not *that much* even if I would like that, but somebody else is going to pay up for your shares.",
