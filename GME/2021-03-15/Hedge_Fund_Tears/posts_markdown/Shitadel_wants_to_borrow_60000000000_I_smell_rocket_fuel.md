A fellow ape u/Vestwak was smart and deep enough to find „WKN A3KM4“

What is that? Why thanks for asking since you seem to miss my headline.   
If you are a good ape and do your own research you find, but for those that need it on a diamond platter:

ah the sweetness of it. It tastes like rocket fuel to me.

I feel that my shares are cuddling in bed with me and I will hold them like I hold Melvins wife when I call her over.   


That 600.000.000,00$ will be good enough just for 300 shares sadly.   
I do NOT pity the boomer that thinks the return of 3,75% till 2026 is a good deal. Since my guess is, there will not be anything of Shitadel left in 2026 after the thruster blast burst them to the earth core.

I keep HODLING, What about YOU?

Edit: yes, yes... the number there? Yes, you see, I am retarded, I stuck crayons up my $ASS and nose, so here it is: 

**600,000,000.00$** 

And that is 600 Million, not Billion. Sorry to disappoint, but no, that is not *that much* even if I would like that, but somebody else is going to pay up for your shares.
