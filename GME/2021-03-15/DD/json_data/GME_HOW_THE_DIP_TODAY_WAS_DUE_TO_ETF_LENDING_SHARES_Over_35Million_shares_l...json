    "selftext": "*Welcome back and it feels good to be writing up posts again. I was asked to write up the recent relation between ETF's and the GME dip's we've been witnessing in the last several trading days.* ***I have included a TLDR for the crayon eating apes with an attention span of a 2-month-old dog.*** \n\nAnyone questions? Feel free to DM and I'll respond in 10-15 working days (jk)\n\n# Hedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking\n\n*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*\n\n**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-**  An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.\n\n**Short Selling-**  Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:\n\n1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.\n2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.\n\n**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver. \n\nIn a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF. \n\n **$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**\n\nNow I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Notice how the assets in XRT plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze? ](https://preview.redd.it/17et6f62ran61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcb89c0022cbfab1688cf686fd4469a5a6c3e4a)\n\n *By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*\n\n***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending. Suspicious, isn't it?***\n\nCredit to u/hkzor for providing these images:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF IWM: 6.5M available last week to 4M today](https://preview.redd.it/ymtslyf6san61.png?width=347&format=png&auto=webp&s=227a69cf7afd19a820a61d91d266da219438f15b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF XRT: 1.3M available last week to 850k today](https://preview.redd.it/jf6hojkcsan61.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=8356b1c474fb8ea77e775db15cc61fe6f8ef2bfb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF IJR: 900k last week to 500k today](https://preview.redd.it/y3cncrbksan61.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=689e63b472520b3f8b172169e0ca3fe2755c96ca)\n\nJust taking into account **Three** ETF lendings, **you could see 3.35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session.**\n\nShort Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure, coupling it with High-Frequency Machines being used, the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days.\n\n**The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then**. They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.  \n\n**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.\n\n**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.\n\n# The Link Between Failure to Delivers (FTD) and ETF's\n\nETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated. \n\n**Failure To Deliver (FTD)-** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The daily volume of FTD traded in the past](https://preview.redd.it/3qfkenw8van61.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba254a6863de1bd6cb04602450b91c889de66cc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ETF's being shorted in the past](https://preview.redd.it/sfv8cphdvan61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f548b1193bbfc06dbc78c3ac1f1d787650eb05)\n\nComparing both charts depict how the recent increase in FTD has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their FTD's way before  $GME. **Bunch of snakes**\n\n **Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting** \n\nWhen faced with \"excessive buying\" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME,  Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as \"Naked\" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in an FTD **but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are \"making markets\" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread. \n\n**TLDR**\n\n**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the SSR need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**\n\n**Can't stop, won't stop.
