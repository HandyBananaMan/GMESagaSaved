Citadel Securities issued 600 Million convertible bonds.

[CITADEL FINANCE LLCDL-NOTES 2021(21/26) REG.S Bond | Markets Insider (businessinsider.com)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/citadel_finance_llcdl-notes_202121-26_regs-bond-2026-usu1718raa69)

At $99.51 EACH. AT 3.75% FUCKING INTEREST.

This is a massive issuance of corporate bonds. At an EXTRAORDINARY interest rate. And will create MASSIVE dilution, as each can be converted to 100 shares, similar to an options contract.

This reeks of desperation. It cannot be hidden, unlike all their strategies to obfuscate their criminal avoidance of SEC Reg SHO and their associated FTDs and naked shorts.

The smell of blood is in the water.

The Killer Whales are circling.

Endgame approaches.

Be aware these bonds do not grant them capital unless they have purchasers. This isn't a loan.

EDIT 2: post to link correcting and clarifying the difference between volume in bonds and volume in an underlying asset. Thanks to u/International_Gold20 for the wrinkles.
