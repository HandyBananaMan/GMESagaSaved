<p>Citadel Securities issued 600 Million convertible bonds.</p>
<p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/citadel_finance_llcdl-notes_202121-26_regs-bond-2026-usu1718raa69">CITADEL FINANCE LLCDL-NOTES 2021(21/26) REG.S Bond | Markets Insider (businessinsider.com)</a></p>
<p>At $99.51 EACH. AT 3.75% FUCKING INTEREST.</p>
<p>This is a massive issuance of corporate bonds. At an EXTRAORDINARY interest rate. And will create MASSIVE dilution, as each can be converted to 100 shares, similar to an options contract.</p>
<p>This reeks of desperation. It cannot be hidden, unlike all their strategies to obfuscate their criminal avoidance of SEC Reg SHO and their associated FTDs and naked shorts.</p>
<p>The smell of blood is in the water.</p>
<p>The Killer Whales are circling.</p>
<p>Endgame approaches.</p>

<p>*edited for clarity and to correct issuance price - thanks to u/nxb123 for the link</p>
<p>Be aware these bonds do not grant them capital unless they have purchasers. This isn't a loan.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: post to link correcting and clarifying the difference between volume in bonds and volume in an underlying asset. Thanks to u/International_Gold20 for the wrinkles.</p>
