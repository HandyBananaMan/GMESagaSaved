<p>Good morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole,</p>
<p>Seriously I can't be the only one smelling that!?</p>
<p>*insert flashy intro card*</p>

<p>None of this is financial advice, just retarded opinions.</p>
<h1>Daylight Savings.</h1>
<p>Guys starting from today NYC will have Daylight savings on, this means that the market will close and open one hour earlier for everyone outside of the DST.</p>
<p>it's a small thing but people need to be aware of this ;)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>STIMMAY!</h1>
<p>So as most people know a lot of people's stimmy's should be hitting the USA in the past weekend, but do keep in mind that not everyone will have received theirs by now.</p>
<p>Meaning there will be some who have it and some who wont have.</p>
<p>So don't worry if you don't see everything launch into the stratosphere today.</p>
<p>Remember this is a war of attrition, a marathon, not a race to the finish this will take some time.</p>
<p>Same goes with other indicators, we have a lot surrounding the end of this week like the 19th, but this is not a guarantee that everything will go as planned, remember that melvin and the like will have people crawling through all the GME related subs and they want to cause as much damage as they can. and demoralizing is one of the easiest ways, so please for the love of Harambe don't set hard dates but let this bastard come at it's own pace.</p>
<p>Remember "the big short" ? you know how long Dr. Michael burry waited for his bet to pay out? 2 years, so you guys should be able to wait a few weeks maybe even months if need be.</p>
<p>Nothing in this world that's worth anything ever came to you easy, it always needed pain effort and time, why should this be any different?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Hi shilly, I hope you're eating enough &lt;3</h1>
<p>Ok so in the weekend a lot of people (including me) have noticed a huge influx of shills.</p>
<p>Funnily enough with DFV's latest tweet domo replied and got my smooth brain an extra wrinkle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/lw04s5umv5n61.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5134df1bdc99459d65398d000f8707c9684e1f6a</p>
<p>DFV's tweet is the "Clint Eastwood from the gorillaz"</p>
<p>This can have several meanings, it can be referencing that WSB started donating to gorilla sanctuaries (which isn't out of the norm for them) or a reference to some part of the lyrics in there.</p>
<pre><code>I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
</code></pre>
<p>But what really got my head going was Domo capitals tweet.</p>
<p>" A virus that invades a host, and tricks the body it into attacking itself by pretending to be something it's not...  Sounds like something</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL">@DOMOCAPITAL</a></p>
<p>has been discussing. "</p>
<p>Now  they've talked about "false idols" before namely the "viking of stocks".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/ti99u6kaw5n61.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06936bebdefebe8025cf2e8ef25fc2b91b173aeb</p>
<p>Apparently this viking guy has been hyping GME then dropping it and has done so twice, which in and of itself is weird for someone who says they're a "professional" investor, or hell anyone who understands our culture in any way shape or form.</p>
<p>So WTF did Domo Capital mean?</p>
<p>Well take the Virus part out and you have the basis for a "false flag" campaign.</p>
<p>And I hear you asking... wtf is a false flag?</p>
<p>check out these links:</p>

<p>you may have heard of this term in the news in the past few years "Hackers from Russia" if a hacker knows how to hack he knows how to hide his trail and use so many proxy's that no one will ever find him so convenient that they left that off right in Russia right?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So how the fuck does this work with GME?</p>
<p>Easy remember all the shills and the bots that we have in here? by technical terms, they are running a false flag operation.</p>
<p>How is that even useful? also easy, divide and conquer.</p>
<p>The shills are in here, nothing we can do against that, they will use all sort of tricks ranging from "price anchoring" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">price anchoring</a> all the way to spreading FUD.</p>
<p>Now first of all let's kill the price anchoring right here, RC ventures stated to his letter to the board that he thought the price of GME should be around $1000 by the end of this year (if someone can check if it was this letter or another one let me know).</p>
<p>Also he stated in an hour long conversation with Domo Capital that it should be around $1000 bucks a piece as well</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/fk58ff0ky5n61.jpg?width=1284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b138c3e78977d777e8be41918e0f14627c20af1</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>The price of GME can go to 1000 usd per share, ON-ITS-OWN.</p>
<p>This means without a squeeze, without any other shit except fundamentals.</p>
<p>and this is why if someone asks me "oh it's now 900/1000 is this the squeeze?" in my view it's easy, NO.</p>
<p>Anyone at this point who thinks that 1000 is the goal doesn't understand how this works.</p>
<p>Also it would be very convenient for Melvin and Shitadel if it stays at that price, why? because if this goes to 6k or 10k they're bankrupt, someone posted here yesterday how their overall value was somewhere along the lines of 5,500 a share anything over that and they'd go bankrupt.</p>
<p>so here is why the price anchoring comes back into play.</p>
<p>The people spamming 1k is enough or oh once it hits 1k we are done with everything.</p>
<p>No my friends that's where the Mother Of All Short Squeezes comes in, the MOASS.</p>
<p>once it hit's 1,000 and no one sells they're still going to need to buy all the shares, and if they can't the price will keep going up and up and up. that has been the backbone of every theory on here. if the people keep holding and the bid/ask divide gets larger the higher the price will go.</p>
<p>This is why you're seeing people say 100,000 is my price or 500,000 because the mechanics support this. if no one is selling and they get margin called to buy everything in the market but no one is selling <strong>POP GOES THE WEASEL.</strong></p>
<p>so this is why shills come in here, to make people waiver, to make people second guess themselves and their price. because if they succeed their company may survive, if they don't the company is done for.</p>
<p>So don't get divided by them, stop thinking everyone with a different opinion is a shill.<strong>STOP INFIGHTING! APES DONT FIGHT APES!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be Nice, OVERLY nice to one and other. why? because this is the easiest way to weed these idiots out, if everyone is helpful and nice these fuckers will stand out like a sore thumb.</strong></p>
<p>And for the love of god, stop worshipping people, this will only help them not you.</p>

<h1>The Gorillaz</h1>
<p>So there has been some bitching and moaning about the altruistic ventures of Wallstreetbets. These professional retards have donated to an animal sanctuary to help out our fellow apes.</p>
<p>This isn't shill tactics this is WSB doing what they've always done, spend money.</p>
<p>Don't forget there are some actual whales on WSB, and spending a couple of hundred bucks is nothing to them nor will it ever be.</p>
<p>And to be clear, during the week when the market is open this is PURE GME ALL THE TIME! Meaning we wont accept any of these post.</p>

<h1>Some final thoughts.</h1>
<p>First of all people need to understand that I'm only one guy, I get tagged in a lot of things to look over, and receive over a thousand pings per day, so it's impossible to read them all and some things get missed.</p>
<p>I've seen people in the weekend trying to discredit me because I didn't read their DD and they got pissed off over it, even going as far as calling me a shill. Guys I'd love to be able to read everything and check everything but this is not humanly possible.</p>
<p>Same goes with DMs.</p>
<p>What I do however think is that this may be a new shill tactic, Discredit the main people who are involved with this so they can take out the center players in this and it's easier to spread fud.</p>
<p>Question everything and everyone, just take it easy and don't attack everyone, remember play extremely nice, treat every fucker on this board as if it's your first date with a hot chick (or dude) and you want to be nice to get a chance right?</p>
<p>if we play overly nice they can't divide us as easy.</p>
<p>Apes together strong.Apes don't fight Apes.</p>
<p>And remember guys this has been a great week, just a month ago this was at 40 and people told us this was over remember that? now we are up to $284 in premarket.</p>
<p><strong>We can remain patient longer than they can stay solvent.</strong></p>

<p>Edit 1:</p>
<p>I almost forgot to mention</p>
<h1>EXPECT FUCKERY!</h1>
<p>seriously we all have such high hopes for the next 2 weeks, so don't expect them to take this laying down, they will try to knock the price down, they will try to demoralize you.</p>
<p>Expect everything, both the price soaring up to Mars and expect it to go back to $40.</p>
<p>Why $40? because we've been there before and we all held through the lows and we will hodl through the highs. expect the worst and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Melvin/shitadel if you're reading this just know, we are not your standard traders, we're retarded apes we don't care how long this takes, but we will wait you out. remember we don't care about dates we care about one single thing, tendies.</p>
<p>And we can wait &lt;3</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>It seems citadel is in need of money :'( poor bastards hahaha</p>
