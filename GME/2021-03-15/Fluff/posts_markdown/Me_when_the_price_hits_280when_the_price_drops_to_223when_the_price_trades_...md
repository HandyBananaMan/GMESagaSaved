# Title: Me when the price hits $280...when the price drops to $223...when the price trades sideways...when the price hits $500, $1000, $10,000. Everyone just relax and enjoy the show. Holding doesn't cost me anything but it's costing the shorts millions and will end up costing them billions. ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
