<p>But that’s just a theory, an ape theory </p>
<p><em>P.S. when this rockets up, be prepared for a new type of FUD- shills telling people to sell at $xxx,xxx rather than the goal of $(x)x,xxx,xxx</em></p>
<p>Edit 1: hey my first ever award, thank you much love fellow ape 🦧❤️🥰</p>
<p>Edit 2: holy Sugar Honey Ice Tea, the all seeing eye award 😅</p>
<p>Edit 3: cheers to u/iksnizal for reminding me to add the obligatory ‘this is not financial advise, crayon eating advise, how to please your wife’s boyfriend advise or any advise for that matter- I’m just an ape who eats red and green crayon grilled cheese with thumbtacks added for extra spice’ for indicating that DFV might be a time traveler</p>
