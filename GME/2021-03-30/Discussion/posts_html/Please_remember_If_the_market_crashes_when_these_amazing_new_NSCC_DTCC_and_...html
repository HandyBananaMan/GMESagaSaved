<p>TLDR: They are preparing to possibly run the DTCC, NSCC, and FICC on bare bones budget per new rule <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-004.pdf">004</a> after having to pay out the nose when the hedgies go bankrupt from new rule <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-003-Approval-Notice.pdf">003</a> that requires them to reconcile their activity and positions daily or face margin calls and/or liquidation of the violators who default on their <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/swiss-miss-fed-basel-iii-and-slr">Supplemental Liquidity Deposit</a> (~3%) calculated daily and even in some cases intra-day per new rule <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf">801</a>!!!</p>
<p>The problem being: SEC allowing naked short-selling bankrupting companies so extensively that rules are created after the damage is done and made public by Redditors that will result in the stock market being liquidated one and only one time to allow a permanent fix to kick in. </p>
<p>No more stupid grand-fathering in the naked short-selling crimes committed like they did circa 2008.</p>

<p>Bottom-line: HODL until your happy-place price is met!</p>
<p>Update: Letâ€™s remain cautious. The DTCC has long been known to be complicit to allowing harmful naked short-selling and none of these rules are eliminating it. While they are managing the risks from someone over-leveraging themselves in short positions gone afoul, their real goal is to remain solvent. </p>
<p>FYI: Rules 003 and 004 are in effect. We are waiting on Rule 801 which was filed on 3/16/21. It <em>can</em> go in effect any time, but they may elect to give the full 60 days for open comments. But honestly, if you were them, would YOU wait the full 60 days? I think they were just waiting on this 004 rule clarifying doomsday powers and processes to get filed and go in effect on 3/29!</p>
