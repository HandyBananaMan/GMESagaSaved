# Title: Apes, donâ€™t let the bots bury this information! This is the follow up post about Fidelity on limits, last week I did Vanguard. THERE IS NO TRANSACTION LIMIT ON FIDELITY. Meaning, you can sell your shares for 10 million each, as long as there is a buyer. Yellow is my question, red is Fidelity.
