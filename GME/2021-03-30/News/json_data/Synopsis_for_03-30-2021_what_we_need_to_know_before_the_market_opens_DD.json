    "selftext": "Good morning San Diago,\n\nI am Rensole,\n\nKenny there is a call waiting for you.\n\n\\*insert flashy intro card\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psnbg9kam4q61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=bead80674782fb7ab03749adcc05b486da55455b\n\nNone of this is financial advice.\n\n# Shills, shills everywhere.\n\nSo as some must have seen yesterday the sub got flooded with messages saying \"Warden is a shill\" with little to back it up, does this sound familiar to someone ?\n\nBecause it sounds familiar to me.\n\nLet's make a few things very clear here, everyone here is doing this as a volunteer, no one is getting paid by anyone and put all their findings here. Are those findings always a 100% correct? no.\n\nSo I have a very simple rule to keep in mind\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4spxna6zm4q61.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=f542f6366355ff9725184346c9d67e492dafa3c6\n\nso it's simple right? If you dislike someone's work, prove that their work is flawed. not with \"gut feeling\" or saying \"I disagree with them\" but prove it \"this person said X but it is Y because if you look at obv+S/L it shows... etc etc\"\n\nI've seen people try character assassination with both Pixel, the mods and myself, and you either back it up with facts or shut up. this is a place that is rooted in facts and documents, not feelings.\n\nIf someone says something you disagree with, be an adult and move on. this isn't high school, so we wont be entertaining high school level drama.\n\nPeople were bitching that Pixel was too optimistic, now they're complaining that Warden for being too careful in his estimates, pick a lane people.\n\nAnd even if you listen to anyone on this board, be it me, warden, or Bigdaddydick69 or coomslayer420, take their info that they presented and analyze it yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nDon't trust anyone here and make your own decisions, but make sure every decision is well formed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af5vcgv7q4q61.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25aa43afb7f9376a5dc87a5d9a7a415b0854c10f\n\n# Accounting for Bias\n\nFor the people that haven't been along long enough to be accustomed to this term, guys account for your own bias.\n\nI'm saying this because last weekend we've seen a hedge fund Archegos die this past weekend and people are flocking to it because \" THIS MUST BE BECAUSE OF GME\".\n\nso let's go over some few basic key points that I hope will help you guys to be more critical thinkers and be able to help the community better.\n\n* ***Bias is the tendency to favor one thing over another***\n* ***Bias is a natural, normal human tendency***\n* **We like and find reasons to reject the things that don't fit that Bias**\n* **Learn what your biases are**\n* **Don't react from a gut feeling, take a step back and look at all the data**\n\nSounds simple right?\n\nEveryone here favors GME, that's our bias.\n\nWe want something to happen to GME yesterday if possible, therefore everything that happens right now is connected to gme in our minds.\n\nAnd if someone comes and says oh but I found X to not fit within this, that person gets attacked because we don't like to see that stuff because it's uncomfortable to have things that doesn't fit our bias.\n\nTherefore your emotions want to go hard \"keyboard warrior\", don't take a step back and think why this person may be saying something and try to learn. even if the person saying shit that's plainly wrong, find their reasoning, why would they say it.\n\nRule with logic, not emotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1mtnaeoq4q61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f276442818e0b44e907e367295a6d5baac352c4c\n\n# NSCC-2021-004 implemented 3/29, effective immediately.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm)\n\nas per yesterday the NSCC-2021-004 was implemented and effective immediately.\n\nu/Klone211 did a great writeup [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mg5z30/found_a_few_interesting_things_in_the_newly_filed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. [Implied volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp#:~:text=Implied%20volatility%20is%20a%20metric,it%20to%20price%20options%20contracts.)(IV) will no longer be incorporated into the calculation of the [Value-at-Risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/var.asp)(VaR)\n\nUnder Section 5.2.1\n\n>\u2026 the amount of [Clearing Fund](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf) required from each Member is determined principally by Value-at-Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) calculations,21 and that in order to ensure the VaR model accurately reflects market conditions and provides adequate protection against market risk, NSCC evaluates several factors on an ongoing basis. The proposed rule change would remove the following factor as one of those evaluated, because it is no longer part of NSCC\u2019s model calculation, \u201cImplied volatility to assess whether a potential increase in market price volatility may not be fully incorporated in the historical price moves.\"22\n\n2. The NSCC can pull funds from the Clearing Fund to help pay for a Member\u2019s losses 2 business days after a [loss allocation notice](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2018/34-82428.pdf).\n\nUnder Section 6.4\n\n>In order to be consistent with the language formulation set out in Rule 4, the proposed rule change would revise this sentence to state, \u201cLosses charged to Members are required to be paid by Members on the second business day after the Corporation issues any such notice of a loss allocation charge and, if not timely paid by any Member, the Corporation may treat that Member as having failed to satisfy its obligation and apply the Clearing Fund deposit of that Member to satisfy its loss allocation obligation.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor more information be sure to check his thread because he covers all the points I would and he did an amazing job with it.\n\nNow there is only one piece missing... oh right the DTCC-2021-801, if all goes well we should see this one kick in soon as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qq6v8hret4q61.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=536416ba5162ea003d13250a9126e833c24ee818\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Sideways baby\n\nFor we go further let's go back to my prefered saying \"we can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent\".\n\nSo I heard a lot of chatter on the sub yesterday about sideways trading being bad, and guess what, you'd be wrong. Going sideways is actually kindof good.\n\nWe are currently above max pain territory (which I believe is 160/170 at the moment), and we must doing something right if you look at the history of Shitadel and Melvin in these past months, because they're losing a lot of money, even going so far as to offer shit grade bonds to get some cash.\n\nWell there is one thing better than just waiting on a catalyst to happen, it's inflicting max pain and waiting.\n\nSeriously everyone keeps talking about this being the endgame etc, chill people this can take a day a week or till the shareholders meeting in june, no one knows how long this will last, so grow a pair and learn to sit back and relax.\n\nu/whiskiz did a great writeup [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfyjit/sideways_trading_until_a_catalystliftoff_is_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) which go's into better detail then I did here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsvp79a0v4q61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07952b58ff594f040a8480ef8af0bb7f61b68673\n\nNow for the more brainy apes among us, here is a paper (like smart people writing stuff) on ETF short interest and ftd naked shortselling or operational shorting.\n\nI know what I'll be reading today\n\n[https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf](https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b63qaptv4q61.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=32bee1498d2b64f62b557125fc87892738195894\n\n# EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tki1jt1xv4q61.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=1480778ddd89dad3692b2369043aaf427a3baa60\n\nRemember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.\n\nbackups:\n\n[https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/](https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/warden\\_elite](https://twitter.com/warden_elite)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\nAnd I'll be posting updates as they happen here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1:\n\n# GameStop Appoints Chief Growth Officer\n\n  it has appointed Elliott Wilke to the role of Chief Growth Officer. \n\nAdditionally, the Company made two other executive hires:\n\n* **Andrea Wolfe, Vice President of Brand Development** \u2013 Ms. Wolfe, who previously served as Chewy\u2019s Vice President of Marketing, started March 29, 2021.
