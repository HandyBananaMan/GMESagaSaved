This will be the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world and all you have to do hold.  \n\nEdit: ape no fight ape. \n\nImmediately after snorting lines of burnt sienna this morning I felt inspired to post.  I picked an arbitrary number between what\u2019s it worth now and $1,000,000 and landed on 8k+ (see that +?) because I have seen a lot of people hop on this train who are don\u2019t have a lot of money by their own admission who are going to be tempted to sell at $8k, $10k, $50k on its way to $1,000,000.  \n\nComing days could be any time in the future\n\nI trust the DD AND I LOVE ALL OF YOU. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit #2 hey I made a bunch of people mad. I\u2019m sorry I was only thinking that we gotta pass quite a few big dollars on the way to a million and trust me I know what it\u2019s like to get a large lump sum of money the very first time. If youve never gotten a bonus or settlement of like even $20k you cannot imagine how good it feels that first time. Be ready. It will be tempting. \n\nI trust the DD. I\u2019ve been obsessed since Jan. I\u2019m in. I\u2019m confident that all signs point to lift off. I have faith in your lumpy brains. I believe. I\u2019m in this fight to win. \n\nApes we are going to blow right past large sums of money that a lot you have never experienced. It will be tempting when the rocket ignites. Be strong.  Trust in each other. This isn\u2019t finiciacal advice. Hell I can\u2019t even spell financial without spellcheck. I am 100% holding until this mother moons at $1,000,000 a share. Period. I will sell if it hits $10,000,000 for sure. But not I\u2019m not selling until it hits a million and comes down. Diamond hands. We\u2019re going close on these clowns.  It\u2019s going to be amazing \n\nOh shit $25 [The simulation has been confirmed. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgryec/true_value_of_a_gme_share_update_25m_per_share/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
