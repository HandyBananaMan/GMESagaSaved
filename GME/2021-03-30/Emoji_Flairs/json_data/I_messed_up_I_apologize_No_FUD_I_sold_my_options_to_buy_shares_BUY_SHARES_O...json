Not my intention at all and I apologize.\n\nI sold my options to buy shares because reading the great DD here I learned how holding options hurts and doesn\u2019t help. \n\nIt also helps you not be so eager for a specific date for lift off. I feel zen already. \n\nLike I said, I apologize for my previous post and to whoever saw it and got scared. That was not my intention.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards. Looking forward to seeing each of you on the \ud83c\udf19",
