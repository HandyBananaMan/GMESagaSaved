It came to my attention that my recent post might spread FUD due to the title. Not my intention at all and I apologize.

I sold my options to buy shares because reading the great DD here I learned how holding options hurts and doesnâ€™t help. 

It also helps you not be so eager for a specific date for lift off. I feel zen already. 

Like I said, I apologize for my previous post and to whoever saw it and got scared. That was not my intention.

Edit: Thanks for the awards. Looking forward to seeing each of you on the ðŸŒ™
