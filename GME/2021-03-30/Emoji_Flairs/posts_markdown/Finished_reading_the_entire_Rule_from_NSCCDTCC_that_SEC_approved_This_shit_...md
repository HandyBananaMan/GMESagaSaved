But then  something magic happened.. one after the other, each person said Holy shit, fuck me running, no fucking way, etc after reading the same thing and coming to this conclusion. (Redacted due to speculation). The NSCC is actually required to liquidate it's entire holdings, if necessary to cover every single position that still exist after liquidating the assets of the firms responsible. Yes. Let that simmer. The DTCC established a plan for liquidating everything allocated to the NSCC and outlines the entire process of the steps the NSCC will take to maintain critical roles until they have to undergo bankruptcy and transfer all responsibility to another party who will takeover the entire role of clearing transactions.. So the takeaway is they planned with the expectations of liquidation of NSCC if required.. Go google the net worth of the NSCC  and lose your shit. I already have. Farewell comrades. I'm going to pray for them to get a quick death, financially speaking.

Here's the text from the document.

Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires, in part, that the rules of NSCC be 
designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions.42
 The Recovery Plan serves to promote the prompt and accurate clearance 
and settlement of securities transactions by providing NSCC with a roadmap for actions 
it may employ to mitigate losses, and monitor and, as needed, stabilize NSCC’s financial 
condition, which would allow it to continue its critical clearance and settlement services 
in stress situations. The Recovery Plan is designed to identify the actions and tools 
NSCC may use to address and minimize losses to both NSCC and its membership and 
provide NSCC’s management and the Board with guidance in this regard by identifying 
the indicators and governance around the use and application of such tools to enable 
them to address stress situations in a manner most appropriate for the circumstances. 
Further, the Wind-down Plan establishes a framework for the transfer and orderly wind-
down of NSCC’s business. It establishes clear mechanisms for the transfer of NSCC’s 
critical services and membership, and for the treatment of open, guaranteed CNS 
transactions in the event of NSCC’s default. By doing so, the Wind-down Plan is 
designed to facilitate the continuity of NSCC’s critical services and enable Members and 
Limited Members to maintain access to NSCC’s services through the transfer of its 
mbership in the event NSCC defaults or the Wind-down Plan is triggered by the 
Board.
As described above, the proposed rule change would update the R&W Plan to 
(i) reflect business and product developments, (ii) make certain clarifications, 
(iii) remove provisions covering certain “business-as-usual” actions, and (iv) make 
certain technical corrections. By helping to ensure that the R&W Plan reflects current 
business and product developments, and providing additional clarity regarding the 
framework for the transfer and orderly wind-down of NSCC’s business, NSCC believes 
that the proposed rule change would help it continue to maintain the Plan in a manner 
that supports the continuity of NSCC’s critical services and enables its Members and 
Limited Members to maintain access to NSCC’s services through the transfer of its 
membership in the event NSCC defaults or the Wind-down Plan is ever triggered by the 
Board. Further, by facilitating the continuity of its critical clearance and settlement 
services, NSCC believes the Plan and the proposed rule change would continue to 
promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 
Therefore, NSCC believes the proposed amendments to the R&W Plan are consistent 
with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
