<p>It came to my attention that my recent post might spread FUD due to the title. Not my intention at all and I apologize.</p>
<p>I sold my options to buy shares because reading the great DD here I learned how holding options hurts and doesnâ€™t help. </p>
<p>It also helps you not be so eager for a specific date for lift off. I feel zen already. </p>
<p>Like I said, I apologize for my previous post and to whoever saw it and got scared. That was not my intention.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the awards. Looking forward to seeing each of you on the ðŸŒ™</p>
