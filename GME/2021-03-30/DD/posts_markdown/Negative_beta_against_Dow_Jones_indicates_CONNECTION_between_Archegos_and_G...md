MSM is not highlighting any connection between the "liquidations" and GME. Also others are generally unsure whether there is any connection at all. This is reasonable because it is a big intuitive jump to say they are connected without any evidence. But look at the negative beta against the **Dow Jones** (i.e. not against the S&P 500).

The beta I use is from **Macroaxis**, which measures beta against the Dow Jones ([https://www.macroaxis.com/volatility/GME/GameStop](https://www.macroaxis.com/volatility/GME/GameStop)). I think the **Bloomberg terminal** (which I don't have access to) uses the **S&P 500** as the benchmark. I didn't screenshot it yesterday but take my word for it that yesterday (29 March), the beta of Gamestop according to Macroaxis was around **-8 or -7**. Today it has jumped to **-4.09**. This change in beta would indicate that there is a connection, otherwise why would the liquidations bring GME so much closer to correlation with the Dow Jones?

Also **Yahoo** (my beta troll) is putting out this headline today: "**Dow hits record as US banks less exposed to hedge fund's liquidation"** (don't want to link to them, google the headline)

Now look at the composition of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (**Wikipedia**): How many US banks are in the Dow Jones anyway? Only two.

![Which banks are on this list?](https://preview.redd.it/4bxotq44r5q61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b7747a86a4f4eef56eae51259b74f064b79f1d)

The only two banks on that list? **Goldman Sachs** and **JPMorgan Chase**. Who was the *first* to start the fire sales? **Goldman Sachs**. Is it simply a coincidence that the bank who started the fire sale benefited via its index? And now Yahoo is implying with its headline that **all US banks** are less exposed now even though there are only two banks listed in the Dow Jones? Maybe the banks are in fact **extremely exposed** and they are pulling at straws to control the general sentiment? So that boomers don't pull out? Remember when Cramer told boomers not to pull out of **Bear Stears**? He is saying the same today:

*My (speculative) interpretation:* GME shorts are net short on their overall portfolio of longs and shorts. The only way to survive for them is to position net short the entire market and engineer a crash. To look more into the connection between the liquidations and GME, I would need to see how the beta is behaving against the **S&P 500**, because that contains pretty much all of the largest US companies, so if anyone can share a screenshot of today's beta or if apes who read this know someone and can ask them, I would be **VERY GRATEFUL**.

**UPDATE:** see here for follow-up, I kept following the trail: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgkqa8/prime\_brokerage\_business\_ie\_risk\_exposure\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgkqa8/prime_brokerage_business_ie_risk_exposure_to/) 

**"Prime brokerage business (i.e. risk exposure to hedge funds) may blow up US banks and with them the market; negative beta against Dow Jones (i.e. not S&P 500) indication of CONNECTION with GameStop"**
