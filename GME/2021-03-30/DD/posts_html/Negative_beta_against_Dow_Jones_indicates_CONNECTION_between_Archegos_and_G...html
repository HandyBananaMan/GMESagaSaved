<p>MSM is not highlighting any connection between the "liquidations" and GME. Also others are generally unsure whether there is any connection at all. This is reasonable because it is a big intuitive jump to say they are connected without any evidence. But look at the negative beta against the <strong>Dow Jones</strong> (i.e. not against the S&amp;P 500).</p>
<p>The beta I use is from <strong>Macroaxis</strong>, which measures beta against the Dow Jones (<a href="https://www.macroaxis.com/volatility/GME/GameStop">https://www.macroaxis.com/volatility/GME/GameStop</a>). I think the <strong>Bloomberg terminal</strong> (which I don't have access to) uses the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> as the benchmark. I didn't screenshot it yesterday but take my word for it that yesterday (29 March), the beta of Gamestop according to Macroaxis was around <strong>-8 or -7</strong>. Today it has jumped to <strong>-4.09</strong>. This change in beta would indicate that there is a connection, otherwise why would the liquidations bring GME so much closer to correlation with the Dow Jones?</p>

<p>Also <strong>Yahoo</strong> (my beta troll) is putting out this headline today: "<strong>Dow hits record as US banks less exposed to hedge fund's liquidation"</strong> (don't want to link to them, google the headline)</p>
<p>Now look at the composition of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (<strong>Wikipedia</strong>): How many US banks are in the Dow Jones anyway? Only two.</p>

<p>The only two banks on that list? <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>. Who was the <em>first</em> to start the fire sales? <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>. Is it simply a coincidence that the bank who started the fire sale benefited via its index? And now Yahoo is implying with its headline that <strong>all US banks</strong> are less exposed now even though there are only two banks listed in the Dow Jones? Maybe the banks are in fact <strong>extremely exposed</strong> and they are pulling at straws to control the general sentiment? So that boomers don't pull out? Remember when Cramer told boomers not to pull out of <strong>Bear Stears</strong>? He is saying the same today:</p>

<p><em>My (speculative) interpretation:</em> GME shorts are net short on their overall portfolio of longs and shorts. The only way to survive for them is to position net short the entire market and engineer a crash. To look more into the connection between the liquidations and GME, I would need to see how the beta is behaving against the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>, because that contains pretty much all of the largest US companies, so if anyone can share a screenshot of today's beta or if apes who read this know someone and can ask them, I would be <strong>VERY GRATEFUL</strong>.</p>
