<p>By now many people have noticed that the borrow fee for GME is very low.  But I think a lot of people still don't realize how low this number actually is.  We can compare GME to other hard to borrow stocks last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tradersinsight.news/traders-insight/securities/securities-lending/securities-lending-report-3-22-21-3-26-21/">Trader's insight recently put out a report of the top 15 hardest to borrow stocks, and GME made the list at position number 3</a></p>
<p>By pulling data from <a href="http://iborrowdesk.com/">iBorrowDesk</a> and <a href="https://finviz.com/">FinViz</a>, we can compare our favorite ticker to some of these other stocks and get a sense of what is going on with GME.</p>

<p>This is insane.  Not only does GME have by far the fewest number of shares to borrow, but the fee is almost nothing.  It's hard to get a sense of how far out of whack GME is with the rest of the universe from numbers, so I made a chart to help visualize the gap:</p>

<p>On the X-axis, we have the normalized available shares, which is available shares to borrow / float.  On the y-axis we can see the borrow fee.  I had to make this <strong>LOG SCALE</strong> in order to be able to even see anything due to how distorted the numbers are with GME.  There is a general trend that as the available borrow shares goes down, you see borrow fees go up (though some stocks have generally more shares and may be more liquid, affecting these numbers).  We can see that TKAT's borrow fee is quite high at 543%, given that there are almost no shares available to borrow right now.</p>
<p><em>But LOOK AT GME!</em>  GME has even fewer shares available as a percentage of its float (they even ran out last week), and yet the borrow rate is almost 0.  This is so out of whack that clearly something crazy is going on.  I consider this strong evidence of some kind of collusion between the banks lending shares to manipulate the borrow fees for GME.  There is no way that the fee should be so low.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> formatting is fucked.  how do you make tables?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> ha ha !  fixed the tables</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong> Fixed a typo when I was converting the available/float from scientific notation into %.</p>
