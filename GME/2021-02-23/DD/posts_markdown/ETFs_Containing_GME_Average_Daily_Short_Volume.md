I started down a bit of a rabbit hole after reading [this amazing post](https://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious_researchers_needed_now_i_think_i_know/) by u/ahh_soy which theorized that Hedge Funds were using ETF's to hide their short positions while making it seem like they covered (great DD, everyone should read this thread).


After reading this post it made me wonder what the daily short volume has been on these ETF's that contain GME over the last few months. We already know that XRT was shorted to over 800% at it's peak, and is now currently sitting at a short interest of about [197%](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=xrt&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) which is obviously super sus.


I managed to find [63 different ETF's](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME
) that all contain GME (not sure if this is a 100% complete list of ETF's containing GME) and I used [Shortvolume.com](https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=GOOG) to go through ![each individual one](https://imgur.com/a/EeCy6jo) and run their daily short volume for the last 1 month as well as the last 3 months and seen some interesting trends in some of these ETF's. I was hoping that someone with a few more wrinkles in their brain would be able to take a quick gander at these charts and offer some insight. I am fairly new to all of this and would really like to hear some insights from people more knowledgeable than myself.


A few things I found interesting, a lot of the spikes in short volume happened around the same time the short interest in GME itself dropped, and the volumes were massively higher than a typical day for these ETF's on specific days over the last 3 months 


A couple of ETF's stood out in particular, XRT being one but this has been gone through in length in the DD I linked above, but I have not seen any information regarding the following ETFs


* XSVM - looking at the 3 month chart will show that this ETF was heavily shorted back in December, to a point where it was almost 100% of the total daily volume in mid December


* VIOV - Looking at the 3 month chart will show a massive spike in trading volume in early January where the short volume was over 90%, as well as a few days in mid December where the short volume was over 90% of the total daily volume


* RWJ - 3 month chart shows a few days again with massive short volume around the 21st of January, as well as a few days in late January - early February where the volume went up significantly, but the majority of it not being short volume


* VIOG - 1 month chart shows a massive spike in volume on February 9th where over 90% of the volume was short and the rest of the week showing lower volume but with the majority of it being short. The 3 month chart shows mid to late December having days where the short volume was over 80% of the daily volume


* VTWV - 1 month chart shows fluctuating short volume with days over 80% of total volume being short. 3 month chart shows a couple of days around December 20th with massive volume where damn near 100% of it is short volume


* VCR - 1 month chart shows a peak volume day of February 3rd with the daily short volume making up 90% of the total volume. The 3 month chart shows it averaging about 60-80% daily short volume in December


* IUSS - 3 month chart shows 3 days with massive spikes in volume with little to no short interest, but the days preceding and following shows a yoyo chart of short interest jumping up then down up then down, some days being nearly 100% of the total daily volume 


* VTWO - 3 month chart shows massive spikes in daily short volumes in early Feb, mid to late Jan and Early Jan. One day in early Jan/late Dec shows a massive spike in volume up to almost 2.2 million shares with nearly 100% of the volume being short.

I apologize for the formatting, i am not overly tech savvy, but I would really like someone more knowledgeable than myself to take a look at this and let me know what they think?
