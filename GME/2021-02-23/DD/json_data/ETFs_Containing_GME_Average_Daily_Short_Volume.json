    "selftext": "I started down a bit of a rabbit hole after reading [this amazing post](https://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious_researchers_needed_now_i_think_i_know/) by u/ahh_soy which theorized that Hedge Funds were using ETF's to hide their short positions while making it seem like they covered (great DD, everyone should read this thread).\n\n\nAfter reading this post it made me wonder what the daily short volume has been on these ETF's that contain GME over the last few months. We already know that XRT was shorted to over 800% at it's peak, and is now currently sitting at a short interest of about [197%](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=xrt&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) which is obviously super sus.\n\n\nI managed to find [63 different ETF's](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME\n) that all contain GME (not sure if this is a 100% complete list of ETF's containing GME) and I used [Shortvolume.com](https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=GOOG) to go through [each individual one](https://imgur.com/a/EeCy6jo) and run their daily short volume for the last 1 month as well as the last 3 months and seen some interesting trends in some of these ETF's. I was hoping that someone with a few more wrinkles in their brain would be able to take a quick gander at these charts and offer some insight. I am fairly new to all of this and would really like to hear some insights from people more knowledgeable than myself.\n\n\nA few things I found interesting, a lot of the spikes in short volume happened around the same time the short interest in GME itself dropped, and the volumes were massively higher than a typical day for these ETF's on specific days over the last 3 months \n\n\nA couple of ETF's stood out in particular, XRT being one but this has been gone through in length in the DD I linked above, but I have not seen any information regarding the following ETFs\n\n\n* XSVM - looking at the 3 month chart will show that this ETF was heavily shorted back in December, to a point where it was almost 100% of the total daily volume in mid December\n\n\n* VIOV - Looking at the 3 month chart will show a massive spike in trading volume in early January where the short volume was over 90%, as well as a few days in mid December where the short volume was over 90% of the total daily volume\n\n\n* RWJ - 3 month chart shows a few days again with massive short volume around the 21st of January, as well as a few days in late January - early February where the volume went up significantly, but the majority of it not being short volume\n\n\n* VIOG - 1 month chart shows a massive spike in volume on February 9th where over 90% of the volume was short and the rest of the week showing lower volume but with the majority of it being short. The 3 month chart shows mid to late December having days where the short volume was over 80% of the daily volume\n\n\n* VTWV - 1 month chart shows fluctuating short volume with days over 80% of total volume being short. 3 month chart shows a couple of days around December 20th with massive volume where damn near 100% of it is short volume\n\n\n* VCR - 1 month chart shows a peak volume day of February 3rd with the daily short volume making up 90% of the total volume. The 3 month chart shows it averaging about 60-80% daily short volume in December\n\n\n* IUSS - 3 month chart shows 3 days with massive spikes in volume with little to no short interest, but the days preceding and following shows a yoyo chart of short interest jumping up then down up then down, some days being nearly 100% of the total daily volume \n\n\n* VTWO - 3 month chart shows massive spikes in daily short volumes in early Feb, mid to late Jan and Early Jan. One day in early Jan/late Dec shows a massive spike in volume up to almost 2.2 million shares with nearly 100% of the volume being short.\n\n\n* EWSC - Another one with a yo-yoing short volume effects, * bouncing as low as almost 0% to as high as almost 100%, over and over\n\n\n* PSCD - more massively yo-yoing short volume\n\n\n* SFYF - massively yo-yoing short volume, with quite a few days over 90%\n\n\n* SYLD - massive spike in volume around the end of Jan, nearly 100% of the volume short\n\n\n* RALS - really have no idea what's going on here, shows pretty much no volume with no short volume but 1 day in Feb and 1 day in Jan with large spikes in volume\n\n\n* FNDB - large spike in volume at the end of Dec, 90% or more of it being short\n\n\n* VBR - Massive spike in volume at the end of Jan, over 90% of it short. Average short volume 60%-80% over the last 3 months\n\n\n* IJS - massive spike in volume around Jan 21st, over 90% of it short\n\n\n* NUSC - massive spikes in volume in mid and late Jan, short volume over the last 3 months consistently between 60%-90%\n\n\n* SLYV - massive spikes in volume multiple times over the last month, with the largest spike having over 90% short volume\n\n\n* SPSM - massive spike in volume on Jan 26th, 90% of it short\n\n\n* SLY - massive spike in volume on Feb 9th, almost 100% of it short\n\n\n* FLQS - massive spike in volume on Jan 25th, short volume fluctuating back and forth between 0% and 100%\n\n\n* IJT - massive spike in volume around Jan 21st, over 90% short volume, another massive spike early to mid Feb, 80% short\n\n\n* GSSC - massive spike in volume on Feb 19th, almost 100% short\n\n\n* SLYG -  large spikes as well around Jan 21st and today, short volume over 70%\n\n\n* VXF - been averaging about 60% or more daily short volume for the last 3 months\n\n\n* NVQ - massive spike in volume in early Jan, daily short volume fluctuating up and down with the daily short volume being up to almost 100% on and off\n\n\n* VB - massive spike in volume end of Jan, over 90% of the volume short, averaging almost 70% short over the last 3 months\n\n\n* SAA - massive spikes in volume today and end of Jan, short volume constantly fluctuating between 20% and 90%\n\n\n* BBSC - Massive spike in volume around Feb 7th, almost 100% short\n\n\n* OMFS - massive spike in volume around Feb 6th being 100% short, then another large spike on Feb 16th being 0% short. Daily short volume fluctuating between 0%-90% and 100%\n\n\n* STSB - massive spike in volume around Feb 6th, 100% of it short volume\n\n\n* SSLY - large spike in short volume on Feb 1st and a massive one on the 2nd, 100% of the volume being short\n\n\n* SCHA - massive spike in volume end of Jan, 90% short volume\n\n\n* PBSM - 3 month chart shows this ETF being shorted all day everyday averaging between 70%-100% short constantly throughout the last 3 months, massive spikes in volume end of Jan and early Feb\n\n\n* UWM - most low volume with low short percentages, averaging around 100k shares or so in volume a day, but in early December the was at least 1 day where the volume spiked to over 4 million shares, with almost 100% of it being short\n\n\n* VTHR - massive spikes in volume in Dec with the short volume being 90%-100%\n\n\n* TILT - massive spike in volume on Feb 2nd, almost 90% of it short. last 3 days the daily short volume has been 90% of the total volume\n\n\n* SPDR - Jan 28th there was a massive spike in volume, nearly 100% of it was short. 3 month chart shows the daily short volume bouncing between 10% and 100%\n\n\n* HDG - same as above, massive spike on Jan 28th with 100% of the volume short, 3 month chart shows it bouncing between 10% short volume and 100%\n\n\n* AVUS - 3 month chart shows this average daily short volume bouncing between 80% short and 100%, up and down up and down\n\n\n* DFAU - averaging between 70% short and 100% short almost daily \n\n\nI apologize for the formatting, i am not overly tech savvy, but I would really like someone more knowledgeable than myself to take a look at this and let me know what they think?\n\n\nI am going to shamelessly plug and link some users who I have seen put in some quality DD around this subject\n\nu/boneywankenboi\n\nu/RocketMooner69\n\nu/Top-Planet8149\n\nu/ahh_soy\n\nu/meta-cognizant\n\nu/MarginallyRetarded\n\nu/cartel3341\n\nu/DerkaRagnarr\n\nu/tombq\n\nu/SixStringSuperfly\n\nu/kekking_ass\n\nEdit: some spelling and grammar, probably still issues but don't care lol\n\nEdit 2: also added the source for where I found these ETFs\n\nEdit 3: GME Short volume charted along side ETF short volume containing GME, credit to u/RaiseRuntimeError",
