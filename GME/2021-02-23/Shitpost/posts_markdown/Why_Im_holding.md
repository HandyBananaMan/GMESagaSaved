This is a once in a lifetime opportunity I know. Let me tell you what this could do for me. 

I’m 28 years old and have been married to the love of my life for 5 years (5 year anniversary next month!). 

A year into our marriage, my wife was diagnosed with a very rare reproductive disease. Fast forward 2 years and a million doctor visits later and she has a total hysterectomy and bilateral oopherectomy - at age 26. We’ve always wanted a large family and had no kids at the time. So this was a hard pill to swallow. 

We’ve been looking into adoption which in my state, can run up to $35k. We’ve discussed refinancing our house or taking out a personal loan to make this happen. My wife also obviously has a lot of medical bills because our new insurance is trash. 

So what I’m saying is that GME mooning means I can start a family. Praying to God this actually happens. I have over 100 shares and that’s all my extra cash.
