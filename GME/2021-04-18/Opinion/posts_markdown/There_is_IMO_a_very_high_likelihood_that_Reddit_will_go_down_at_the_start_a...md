#Title: There is, IMO, a very high likelihood that Reddit will go down at the start and during/throughout the squeeze. Read the exit strategy posts, know what you’re doing. Expect there will be no one to hold your hand.

Whether it’s HF’s doing it or there’s a legitimate strain on the Reddit servers from millions of apes logging on, expect there to be no access to Reddit throughout the squeeze. Know what your exit strategy is, if you have one, and be confident in yourself. 

Remember, 🦍 together 💪 even when they try to tear us apart.
