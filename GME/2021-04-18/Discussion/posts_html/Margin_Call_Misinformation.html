<p>I posted a graph of the January fake squeeze the other day and had several responses saying "things will be different this time. Once they are margin called they can't manipulate the price." This is quite misleading and untrue from an ape's perspective. </p>
<p>Yes, once margin called an entity loses control of its transactions, but there is more than one entity shorting GME. It is entirely possible, and should be expected IMO, that once the HF with the lowest value of assets gets margin called the rest of the shorts will hammer the hell out of the price in a last ditch hail Mary to try and protect themselves by fooling apes into thinking the peak has happened.</p>
<p>TLDR: once the price rockets dips don't mean the peak has happened, or even that apes are selling, because bigger HFs will be able to manipulate the stock until they themselves are margin called.</p>
<p>EDIT: this is taking off so if y'all want a laugh please check out this parody song I wrote last month that got buried in new. I spent quite a bit of time on it and really think you'll enjoy it. (New link)

<p>EDIT2: someone thinks this is FUD. If the margin call domino theory happens this post becomes irrelevant in the best way possible. Do not try and day trade the squeeze to maximize gains if you are stupid enough to interpret this post that way. Don't day trade GME at all. This would be a temporary dip as apes are holding and despite manipulation the demand for those margin called shares will rocket the price once again due to no supply, so don't sell thinking it will be another 3 months until next try and you will have plenty of time to reposition. That is not the way.</p>
<p>EDIT3: I have to go to bed so I leave this post in your diamond hands. Happy holding everybody!</p>
