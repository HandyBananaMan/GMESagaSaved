<p>I see soo many posts about apes begging for a dip, and waiting to buy. </p>
<p>Just so everyone knows, the squeeze will happen when nobody expects it to happen. (Unless citadel miracelously gets margin called) </p>
<p>STOP begging for a dip, and just jump on. It does not matter if you bought at 180 or 120, or even 400. When we reach 6 digits you will regret trying to wait for the dip. </p>
<p>As always, ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤²</p>
