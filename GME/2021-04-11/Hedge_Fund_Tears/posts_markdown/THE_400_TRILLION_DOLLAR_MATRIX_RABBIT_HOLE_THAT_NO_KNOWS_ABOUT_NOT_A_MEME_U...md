Libor Thesis Questions


1. What is Libor
2. Why is Libor important to know and understand
3. Libor is not for just Europe
4. Time Line of Libor and its history relating to 2008- Libor Started in 1986
5. Understand Libor Scandal- What players were involved then vs now???
6. How does Libor relate to United States Dollar and Europe
7. How much money will this transition be= $400 TRILLION- Not a Typo
8. Timeline for Europe to stop using Libor
9. Timeline of United States to stop using Libor
10. What is the ARRC
11. What is SOFR
12. What is SONIA
13. What are Derivatives


Now that the basics are taken care of its time to start diving down the rabbit hole and what I call- The Spider Web Effect

1. Why are banks interest rates so important to EVERYTHING in the Entire world and especially our economy.
2. How will these rate changes affect the entire market
3. How will they pay for all the endless money printing going BRRR
4. Understanding that most Hedge Firms like Citadel barrow money in 3, 6, 9 and 12 month intervals for options contracts in the derivatives market
5. How does Barclays Bank loaning money to Citadel connect the deep spider Web and Libor Scandal- look at Citadels 2019 financial statement on page 6 note 5
6. Once Libor ends and they CANT manipulate FAKE low interest rate #s for loans, then what??
7. How much DeLeveraging will Libor Ending Trigger??
8. Who will they blame for this ALREADY PLANNED EVENT when it occurs
9. Why does No one know about Libor and its $400 Trillion dollar transfer
10. Why is no one talking about Libor


Video and Research notes

11. Why in ALL these videos of BIG bankers are they CONSTANLY talking about changing their wording in their loan contracts with their current and new customers?? They constantly outline lawyer risk and how they want to be ahead of the curve and change document wording to prevent lawsuits before the Libor transition occurs

12. They mention that some Hedge Funds will be very upset through this transition and some wont survive through this transition

13. They said they have Liquidity and Volatility concerns through this transition

14. Once this Libor transition is complete, they will be doing like a monthly stress test on Hedge Funds and Banks to determine Risk exposure. The whole point of Libor ending is to prevent a 2008 type event. However SOFR is more of an Adjustable rate

15. How and what will they do about the derivatives and options market- As they had said they have massive concerns about the options market

16. How will they deal with swaps in the derivatives market? Spreads??

17. How will Bonds and Treasuries act during and after this transition. Is this why they needed to dump the price of Bonds hard? So this way they have a vehicle to store some of the $400 Trillion transfer?

18. They said they anticipate a lack of liquidity at the beginning of the Libor transition

19. Timeline- Originally for US dollar phase 1 exiting out of Libor was supposed to be done by June 30th of 2021. But they extended it on March 5th 2021 because the derivatives market in SOFR is not robust enough yet. The new extension for US dollar to keep using Libor rates is Now June 30th of 2023. However Europe phase 1 exiting out of Libor had to be done by March 31, 2021. Euro and Sterling still has to be exited out of Libor by December 31st of 2021

20. When will big banks start exiting out of Libor and start new Contracts under SOFR and SONIA- What kind of affect on other banks and HFs will this have?


Misc Notes

1. Barrow fees will be Way more Expensive in the future for hedge Funds to barrow
2. Is this why they allowed the rates to be so low, so they could stick us, We The People with the Bill once they raise the rates in 2023 or Before as Banks will do new contracts LONG B4 LIBOR ends!!!
3. How will this affect the housing Market
4. Will home loans be an adjustable rate based off of SOFR
5. How much of the current $400 Trillion in Libor will go into SOFR and how much will go into SONIA- SOFR currently has about $200 Trillion in it already I believe.
6. How many are so over leveraged currently that wont survive this transfer and will have to Risk Off and sell long positions because the fees and rates will be higher under SOFR
7. How will this affect PFOF Payment For Order Flow and the HFS Algo computers that are based on super low interest rate #s that are false made up low interest #s by big bankers- How will these equations and programming of these Algo computers have to change and will that shift alone create a oh fvck moment
8. This is THE MOTHER OF ALL CATALYSTS AND THEY DON’T WANT TO LET THE WORD GET OUT ON THIS $400 TRILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER AND DISRUPT THE MARKET- WHO WILL BE LEFT HOLDING THE BAG??
9. What’s like a .5% increase on interest rates for $400 Trillion.
10. FML a loaf of bread is going to cost like $10-$15
11. They will throw all good debt and bad debt in SOFR and SONIA and when they raise the rates we will all be paying for the Jackassery they are doing right now!
12. LIBOR IS THE REAL REASON ALL THE NEW LEGISLATION LAWS ARE GOING THROUGH THE SEC, DTCC AND OCC RIGHT NOW
13. How the hell can one explain this Matrix Jenga Puzzle to Apes
14. Will they let the market run Hot until June 2023 like 1997-2000 Dot Com bubble- Chart is looking like they might?? If they did then maybe Jerome Powell is being honest about not raising rates till 2023 but who knows


Chart

Go to TradingView.com and look up the S&P 500 under Ticker symbol SPCFD:SPX this will give you a chart that dates back to 1929. Hit LOG on the bottom right of screen and it will give you broad view of the chart. Use Monthly candles time frame so you can see the entire picture from now till 1929. You can change the regular candles usually used, to Heikin Ashi Candles at top left of screen. Heikin Ashi candles are sometimes better to use on longer time frames like on a monthly chart.  You will be able to see ALL market tops and crashes. You can draw trend lines of market tops and bottoms to see what phase or cycle in the market we are at. I personally believe this is the chart that the big banks use to trade off of and there’s a reason why this chart is not common imo. Most SPX charts only go back so far and definitely not back to 1929. Once you draw the correct trend lines from 1937 top to 2008 top you will see what Im talking about. Then draw a parallel line from 1929 top to 2000 dot com top, you will see what Im talking about. Point is, that I thought we would  reverse hard in January- February on the monthly chart, cause that was the first time we hit that resistance line since 2008 top. However we broke past that line and it appears according to the chart that they might let the market run rapid for awhile like the dot com bubble top trend line. Which would be insane and honestly once we broke that trend line in Februrary, it contradicted my Libor thesis. But once they changed the dates of the Libor ending from year end of 2021 to June 2023 for US dollar then it kind of makes sense and the chart agrees with that possibility as of now.
 


Final Thoughts

At the end of the day Libor Ending will be the biggest catalyst that almost no one knew about and it ties so many great DDs out there together. Just most haven’t seen the big picture or don’t know about it yet. All I know is when this thing kicks off whether its this year or next year, this shit will make 2008 look like small potatoes and this will DRARF 1929 and WE THE PEOPLE will be blamed and Fvcked to OBLIVIVIAN TO PAY FOR THERE GARBAGE ONCE AGAIN!! Time to do the DD on this and help get the word out. I understand this but need some wrinkled brains to explain it to others.
Below is a list of Libor Vids that are extremely important to watch. These are not my personal vids but more like Big Wig Bankers that know there stuff. This DD is the most important DD we can share with people if we can explain it correctly and somewhat easily. Ive literally got most of this memorized, but some may have to watched or listened to Libor vids 3-5 times each. But need  smooth brains help explaining it to others. Thank you for taking the time to read this and doing your own DD.

Edit 1- TLDR: They will sell there LONG positions they’ve been long on since 2009 and DELEVERAGE BECAUSE SOFR RATES WILL BE WAY MORE STRICT AND BORROWING COSTS WILL BE AN ADJUSTABLE RATE BASED ON SOFR. THE BORROWING COSTS WILL BE INCREASING TO INSANE LEVELS LIKE EVERY CRASH!! THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OVER LEVERAGE LIKE THEY CAN NOW!!! This however can be later this year or next year! But this confirms ALL the DD how much of a mess the Hedgies are in and for GME YA 💎🤚🚀

Edit 2: 
I didn’t post full thesis for reasons as follows.
1. Just a normal Ape that works a full time job and has researched Libor Ending this for over 6 months.
2. Most have said this transition will have little affect on the market and that’s BS they do not want you to know the REAL TRUTH. THERES A REASON THEY DONT WANT DUMB APES TO SEE THE PONZI SCHEME.
3. I don’t want my own thesis to sway other Smooth Brain Apes to my thesis or bias. I WANT OTHERS TO RESEARCH THIS AND CONFIRM OR DENY MY OWN FINDINGS?
4. The questions listed are the questions that need answered and addressed to see how big the Spider Web is and how we can let WE THE PEOPLE know what’s really going on
5. This event might just be the worse thing to happen since 1929. No BS. 
6. Libor is based off of fake interest #s that  the big bankers give loans to Hedge Firms, Home Loans, Derivatives...
7. Bankers can currently manipulate those interest #s under current LIBOR so their other bankers and Hedge Firms can barrow for CHEAP!
8. SOFR= Puts the Ponzie Scheme of LIBOR to rest RIP
9. However the transition will be ugly cause they are ALL OVER LEVERAGED TO THE MAX!!
10. DO THE DD 
11. NOT A SHILL- WAKE UP PEOPLE
12. Thank you for reading and sharing

EDIT 3: 
WATCH or LISTEN TO THE VIDEOS IN ORDER AND YOULL GET IT. TY

Edit 4: 
It took 2 months for my smooth brain to even understand WTF LIBOR is. Then after 6 months of research on LIBOR it’s like the biggest dam spider web in my brain that I don’t know how to explain it to others. If you have a wrinkled brain please help decipher this matrix web to explain it to others. It’s so deep and dark I honestly have no idea how to explain it to others without it being like a 5 page document. Research do DD and post for others. IMO there is not another event bigger than this. They can blame this event on whatever they want but ALL the Tea Leaves are right here for the final puzzle pieces. TY

Edit 5:  
Due to spam and others I won’t be answering anymore questions or updates as of now. DO THE DD OR DONT. Either way don’t give a fuck. It’s all right here for you. GL or go Fuck yourself. Either way is fine with me. I’ve held GME this whole time 🖕💎🤚🚀

Edit 7:  

This awesome Ape u/sharkbaitlol breaks down what I’ve been trying to say and puts everything in correct context. Timelines for US dollar vs UK contracts needs adjustment but DD is on point! READ SECTION 4 and give him a 👍
