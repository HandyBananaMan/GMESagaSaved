    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\n**by now we have all seen the headlines, Melvin Capital supposedly closes Q1 with a 49% loss:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2t8gx5iqls61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=002ea298dff1ea89b3388fd33ba24b0923a600b0\n\nOf course, whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but I have just spent half an hour inputting stock price changes into Melvin's portfolio, and **if it's true, IT'S REAL BAD.**\n\nApart from being **a fraudulent short seller**, Mr. Melvin is actually a pretty shrewd investor.\n\nFor the period ending 31 DEC, he reported to the SEC a **Portfolio Value of $22,639,690,000** across 77 positions, opening 5 new ones, and closing 36 positions. Mister Melvin sold a lot of profitable calls and stock at the start of this and previous quarter (at first glance), so it's also likely he is sitting on a sizeable cash reserve. But that's not the crux of this analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In this report for 31 DEC 2020, Mr. Melvin reports holding $19,787,325,000 LONG in the following stocks:**\n\n[ Great bet on AVIS, Mr Melvin! I will spend it wisely. ](https://preview.redd.it/hr7vlwnjqls61.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d11ea5b064f6069168c48e1867b6dbd4237f88a)\n\n[ ANF sure turned out to be a shrewd pick, huh?! Good going Gabe! ](https://preview.redd.it/bpqj8hmkqls61.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2d6405f9d8e2972112627d2ec3ef7e27846fb6d)\n\n[ Gabe with the X-ray vision on XRAY! ](https://preview.redd.it/gz9g0mglqls61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=99162f28d1fb13527e5cea35954999970acfafa2)\n\n# Let's zoom the total in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/too0x42mqls61.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=05afbbb9e61b682a4b1e649814bd91373d8925c7\n\n# Mr. Plotkin posted a 7.62%, or $1.507bn profit in his LONG holdings between the 31 DEC report, and 31 March 2021!\n\n# Well done Mr. Plotkin! Thank you for making sure you have enough liquidity to pay any liabilities that may come up in the future!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**49% of Mr. Plotkin's LONG portfolio would be:**\n\n# $10,434,209,633!\n\nA $10.43bn loss, guys!\n\n**A $10.43bn loss, so far, Gabe.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------\n\n**Find more long-read DDs in my profile, I now research and write about GME full-time thanks to the kindness of the apes!**",
