<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p><strong>by now we have all seen the headlines, Melvin Capital supposedly closes Q1 with a 49% loss:</strong></p>

<p>Of course, whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but I have just spent half an hour inputting stock price changes into Melvin's portfolio, and <strong>if it's true, IT'S REAL BAD.</strong></p>
<p>Apart from being <strong>a fraudulent short seller</strong>, Mr. Melvin is actually a pretty shrewd investor.</p>
<p>For the period ending 31 DEC, he reported to the SEC a <strong>Portfolio Value of $22,639,690,000</strong> across 77 positions, opening 5 new ones, and closing 36 positions. Mister Melvin sold a lot of profitable calls and stock at the start of this and previous quarter (at first glance), so it's also likely he is sitting on a sizeable cash reserve. But that's not the crux of this analysis.</p>

<p><strong>In this report for 31 DEC 2020, Mr. Melvin reports holding $19,787,325,000 LONG in the following stocks:</strong></p>
