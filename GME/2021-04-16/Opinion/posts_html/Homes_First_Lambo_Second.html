<p>Post MOASS build yourself a custom 4-6k sq ft  (370-560 sq m) home. Get a space that defines you, makes you happy AND put the whole nation to work. </p>
<p>If you're gonna be living downtown, buy a wreck and revamp it. </p>
<p>Spread the wealth in a meaningful way by giving people work. Pay normal for adequate work, pay extra for good work, pay double for beautiful work. We reward craftsmanship.</p>
