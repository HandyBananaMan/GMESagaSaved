    "selftext": "Ok, fellow apes, i have to share this. I've  been searching in wich scenarios the MOASS won't happen, read all the counter DD's from shills, and came out with that list. Hope you won't think i'm a shill, but wanted to warn you. OK so now let's have a look on that list:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 - An asteroid hits the Earth (if it hits in U.S. soil, it will definitely end the MOASS, but only because it can destroy NYSE. However, if it hits Africa or Europe or Asia, i don't see fellow apes selling their shares just because of that);\n\n2 - A massive earthquake shakes everything up (imagine if DFV was an earthquake, it would cause some damages and could end the MOASS);\n\n3 - Aliens invade the Earth (can we guarantee for sure that aliens are not shorting GME? Never saw a DD on that important matter);\n\n4 - Biden totally forgets where's the White House and won't sign the documents that will allow Gensler to fuck shit up;\n\n5 - RC is a spy from CIA, endorsed to put Kenny G. as GameStop CEO.\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot of ways in wich the MOASS won't happen! I think those are the main ones. So don't believe when someone says that the MOASS is a certain thing! We have to be prepared for all scenarios! Hope this information was usefull to you, fellow brainless retarded apes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Ok, first of all, thank you for all your upvotes and awards dear apes! Never had something similar. Sorry if I scared you at first glance, but i'm sure I compensated it with a good laugh!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Some of you apes told that would actually like to know in wich cases or what would need to happen for the MOASS to be off. I haven't find any of that, because it really seems the fundamentals are on our side. Nevertheless, I found this post from our fellow ape  [u/anonfthehfs](https://www.reddit.com/user/anonfthehfs/) , wich I think can really give some perspective towards what we're facing here.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms3ba5/opinion\\_piece\\_why\\_the\\_whales\\_are\\_not\\_in\\_a\\_rush/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms3ba5/opinion_piece_why_the_whales_are_not_in_a_rush/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEDIT 3: Well, after DFV legendary doubledown, i think that either the correct answer is the fifth option, or DFV is our MOASS in flesh!",
