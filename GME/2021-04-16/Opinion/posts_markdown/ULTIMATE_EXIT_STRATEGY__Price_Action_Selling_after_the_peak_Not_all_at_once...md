First of all Iâ€™m too smooth brained of an ape to have elaborated anything sophisticated myself. Everything I talk about here, I owe it to others, great posters, which you can read articles on the matter by searching Â« exit strategy Â» on /GME and /Superstonk.


Hereâ€™s my personal summary and popularization, for family and friends, hence, for apes.
I will try to describe **the price action**, for a better understanding of what should happened based on othersâ€™ writing and the Volkswagen squeeze of 2008  (read Wardenâ€™s exit strategy here : https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/) and get back on the 3 essential guidelines of a succesful exit strategy :

**- Do NOT use market orders** *(edit : unless you have no other options)*

**- Sell after the peak**

**- Do NOT sell all at once**


ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

**A) THE PRICE ACTION**
*Be aware that there is no way to be certain it will unfold that way. But itâ€™s a possibility. Other possibility, according to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaalT8rn9lc is that YOU SET THE PRICE. Because there is a glitch in the matrix. In which case itâ€™s pretty simple : you put a sell limit order at the price you want, and just wait. **- Edit 21/04/18 : check this other video less detailed but more fun https://youtu.be/D4Qzq8ZdvL4**. IF it doesnâ€™t unfold this way : read on.*


The action described below will take place on **multiple hours or days**. APES HAVE TIME.
There will be lots of halts.


1) **Price will rise, faster and faster**, triggering FOMO and possibly a **GAMMA** squeeze (which is a squeeze related to options only, of much lower magnitude than the **SHORT** squeeze that apes long for). At this point, HF still have potentially control over the price. (Although, it is possible that the price skips step 1) and starts directly at step 2), which is why day-trading is **extremely risky**).


2) **First real explosion of price**, as the first HF gets margin called. That particular HF loses total control of its funds. A bot scans the market in its name and buys every GME shares it finds, **WHATEVER** the price. As long as apes donâ€™t sell, the price, rises ; if apes put high selling orders and the bot canâ€™t find any lower price it will buy high. **Nevertheless** others HF that havenâ€™t been margin called yet still have means of action, although itâ€™s unrealistic to think they could do much at this level of price and at this point in time (but who knows).


3) **Price will stabilize or dip**, a little or more, due to paper hand selling ; whale selling, or the margin call of that first HF reaching an end. Although some symbolic/round numbers might see a dip (expect one at 10.000$ or 100.000$ for example).


4) **Second explosion of price**, as another HF gets margin called.


5) 3) and 4) repeat themselves, as many times as HF are being margin called.


6) **PLATEAU** After a dip in price, instead of exploding again, the price will stabilize and **plateau**. Quoting u/Krissco *Â« This is the moment that buying = selling. Shorts still need to cover, retail diamond-handed-apes are finally ready to cash them in. At some point on the plateau (no halts here - just massive volume) we will start down the other side where more apes want to sell than hedgies to buy. Â»*


7) There **could/should** be another peak, before the price plummets, based on VW precedent, this second peak would go almost as high as the first one.

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

**B) 3x GUIDELINES**


**1) DO NOT USE MARKET ORDERS** *(edit : unless you have no other options)*
As explained by u/chrism3215 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrnswq/when_the_squeeze_is_squoze_use_a_limit_sell_not_a/
THIS IS UTTERLY IMPORTANT. Market orders could sabotage the selling price for you and for ALL APES.
Apes should use **sell limit orders** instead.
For those using brokers such as **eToro** which does not allow to put **sell limit orders** it is MY understanding that apes should better sell their share **one by one**. (= **COULD THIS BE CONFIRMED BY A WRINKLED BRAIN ????** Thank you).


**2) Sell after the peak**
Itâ€™s been repeated quite a number of times already : there is NOTHING to win with selling before the peak. It will not be safer because we will have plenty of time to sell. And it will not guarantee you a satisfactory minimum price because we donâ€™t know how high it can go.
On the contrary, it will lower your overall gains AND the maximum price apes could reach.
Selling before what you manage to identify as a peak is pure waste, unless youâ€™re very lucky : but it is in no way a good tactical move, rather an emotional one : you should be wary of those.


**3) Do not sell all your shares at once**
Apes will never be 100 % sure the peak is reached. Strategically speaking it is much wiser and more efficient to divide your shares in lots, thus allowing yourself to have several shots at identifying the peak right. Take it as a game, like youâ€™re at the fare : and you want to have at least three shots to get the pile of bottles down and bring back the big fluffy teddy bear . Three shots at least. Not one. Unless, of course, you have only one share.
Also, as u/Robot__Salad mentionned here : https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqbs97/from_fake_shares_to_millionaires_common/
*Â« If you sell only a small fraction of your shares at a time, you will help maintain the peak of the squeeze for as long as possible, and help your fellow apes get some tendies as well. Â»*

**C) TO CONCLUDE** remember you **have time**. When the squeeze starts, take a break, raise yourself to the height of the event. Your family, friends, and the World count on you (no pressure!). Follow u/eternalconstruct1 5-10 minutes rules https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mre6n9/when_the_squeeze_happens_510_min_rule/


At this point in time, there is nothing more important than preparing your exit strategy.
If you want some more reading, on the matter, you can read the much more sophisticated article of u/wardenelite : https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/


Also here is a question-thread about the mechanism of the squeeze, you can read the answers (which have inspired this thread) : https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrlijr/can_someone_explain_in_details_the_mechanism/


Please, also read this very relevant article from u/TheThinkerist https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mra1rx/this_exit_strategy_seems_legit_looking_for_any/
...who bases his exit strategy on the model of $DRYS squeeze. Let me TLDR as such : 

**1-** Wait for a peak in **Volume**

**2-** past that peak in volume, wait for the **MACD Divergence** (= the colored sticks) to dive to 0 

**3-** WHILE the RSI moves down toward 30.

This was the best way to time the peak for $DRYS squeeze and could be a good way to time $GME.


And remember something : we will all miss the top of the peak. This does not matter. What matters is not to miss the squeeze by selling too early.


Remember another thing : there is the amount of money you want for yourself, your personnal confort and your family. But there is also :

- a good amount youâ€™ll have to pay in taxes

- the money you could give to friends

- the money you could use to DO things rather than BUY things : build projects and companies

- the money you could use to SUPPORT causes that matter. And thereâ€™s a lot of good that awaits to be done, thanks to you, all around the world.


**SO BE GREEDY !!** Be greedy as a fucking hedge fund.
