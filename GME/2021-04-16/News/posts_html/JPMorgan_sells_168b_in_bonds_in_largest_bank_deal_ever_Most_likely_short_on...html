<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. sold $US13 billion ($16.8 billion) of bonds on Thursday (US time), the largest deal ever by a bank, taking advantage of some of the cheapest borrowing costs in years to boost its capital after the Federal Reserve let pandemic relief measures lapse.</p>
<p>The deal, which followed the bankâ€™s best quarter ever, hit the market as corporate borrowers continue to see heavy demand for debt that provides a decent premium over Treasuries. Order books grew to about $US26 billion, allowing JPMorgan to trim the interest on the debt from the relatively high spreads it initially offered, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.</p>
