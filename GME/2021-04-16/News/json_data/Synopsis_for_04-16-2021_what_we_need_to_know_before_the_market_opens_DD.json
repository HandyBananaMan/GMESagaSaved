    "selftext": "Good morning San Diago,\n\nI am Rensole,\n\nDo you smell that?\n\n\\*insert flashy intro card\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e44xiyjzht61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=14bf60a26f1a4b754350b479f610482e91470359\n\nNone of this is financial advice, just a monkey with a typewriter and an internet connection.\n\n# Remember, he has options!\n\nOk so let's talk about the OG here, u/deepfuckingvalue.\n\nThis dude has 50k in options right now and it's his choice to either execute them fully, partially or not, knowing him I'm personally banking on him executing all of them, or \"going all in\" like in rounders.\n\nWho knows the madlad may even double his position for all we know.\n\nwe won't know what he does or does not do until he shows us. so let's hope we get an update today, I know I'd love to see it and most of you would as well.\n\nBut do know, DFV will most likely not cause a squeeze, his options have been hedged a long time ago so unless this madlad buys even more...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pac2fahk0it61.jpg?width=613&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=280e9e8fb41927ba40662a1ff3274b8f44fc0f1f\n\n# To big to fail\n\nSo anyone who lived through the 2008 crash can remember one thing, jim cramer's bear stearns video, and the Lehman brothers going down.\n\nu/Captain_Omar did a great write-up on JP Morgan suddenly offering $13 billion in bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrm243/jpmorgan_to_sell_13_billion_of_bonds_in_largest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nFrom the article:\n\n>[JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) is poised to sell $13 billion of bonds, setting a record for the largest bond sale ever from a bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The longest portion of the [five-part offering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QRMBW8GQOFSW), a 31-year security, is expected to yield 107 basis points above Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the matter. The sale comes a day after JPMorgan reported strong first-quarter [earnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-14/jpmorgan-posts-investment-banking-fee-surge-while-loans-decline), including a 15% increase in fixed-income, currency and commodity trading revenue and a $5.2 billion release from its credit reserves. Rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is also [selling bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QRM8YZGENSW0) Thursday.The previous largest sale by a bank also came from JPMorgan, a [$10 billion offering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/Q8UJIMDWLU6Y) in April 2020, the Bloomberg-compiled data show.JPMorgan is the sole bookrunner of the sale, and the proceeds are marked for general corporate purposes.\n\nSoooooo does this ring any bells for anyone because for me it really reminds me of the banks in 08 having liquidity problems. and if they have been doing some shorting as aggressively across the board, and they did this to the treasury bonds as well... the dollar may face some trouble as when the treasury bonds go bust, so does the USD.\n\nAgain I can be misinterpreting the information completely here, but feel free to say so.\n\nAlso weird in the banking world, Head managing director of Goldman Sachs derivatives division handed her resignation yesterday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7z90xfo16it61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=dabd56d71984bfd505b886e9b3d6bead92aab39c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3plrj512it61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1d46533c840cb535ef946d25bc2257200827e25\n\n# Weird Awards\n\nOk so this is something new the shills are trying\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mriob8/new\\_shill\\_tactic\\_using\\_award\\_comments\\_for/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mriob8/new_shill_tactic_using_award_comments_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nThey give out awards with (semi) threatening posts along with the award.\n\nIf this happens to you just report it, for targeted harassment against you and Reddit themselves will take action.\n\nI've always felt that when someone tries to shut you up because you're contributing it means you're doing something right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmmg41a13it61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=945052e66181544c392d3a4474d77ff5524b93a5\n\n# Robbin da Hood\n\n[https://www.sec.state.ma.us/sct/current/sctrobinhood/MSD-Robinhood-Financial-LLC-Complaint-E-2020-0047.pdf](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/sct/current/sctrobinhood/MSD-Robinhood-Financial-LLC-Complaint-E-2020-0047.pdf)\n\nOk so it seems that RH is getting it's license revoked in Massachusetts, while at first this may sound awesome (as they should have their license removed across the board imo as they've shown repeated bad faith), this one however is not that great.\n\nThe reason for the Massachusetts securities wanting to remove their license is because and I quote:\n\n\"Robinhood encourages inexperienced investors to place risky trades without limits.\"\n\nSo this seems to be a double edged sword, because I believe one should moderate these brokers (SEC WAKE UP CALL THIS IS YOUR 9 O'CLOCK!) because they do have \"gamification\" in there which should be removed, but it can be harmful for us the retailers as this could set a precedent to add more rules in for the retail traders (aka making it an even less fair market then it already is).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9g90u664it61.jpg?width=218&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3087aae0ad559f22a466d9a64e08de82d94ad991\n\n# SEC Meeting cancelled... again...\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg041521-cancellation.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/closedmeetings/2021/ssamtg041521-cancellation.htm)\n\nOk last time it got canceled it was weird due to multiple things happening that day (including the head of the whistleblower program stepping down), so that was weird right? coincidences happen and correlation is not equal to causation, so here we are a month later Same activities that need to be voted on or talked about aaaand it's gone... again.\n\nLike what the hell is going on there?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tqva9up4it61.jpg?width=623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bef5847dde874964f62e26aabff6ed7e78a1125\n\n# FTD DATA\n\nSo as people where mentioning GME didn't have enough FTD's to even to fit in the FTD DD I did some digging.\n\nNamely one thing we forgot, it's not just the GME ticker, it's also the ETF tickers.\n\nLets go and check some here\n\n20210326|464287655|IWM|**1098952**\n\n20210330|464287804|IJR|**218376**|ISHARES CORE S&P SM CAP ETF|106.59\n\nas of right now 72 ETF's hold GME... can someone with a very wrinkled brain go through these?\n\n[https://www.etf.com/stock/GME](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME)\n\nBecause I'm sure we will find some tasty FTD's to go along with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmlq5xp56it61.png?width=2190&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f524678646c2ffb744ac061b3378a60c6427dc6\n\n[the cornered beast](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrp5mz/like_a_beast_cornered_and_im_not_talking_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3hw79upe6it61.jpg?width=460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1581be9adac516bf73e0bb17e536cf5131bc0fbd\n\nSomething to keep in mind though, is that yesterday Sherman's shares got yeeted, so.. we may see some news on a new CEO stepping in soon (I hope) or perhaps we have to wait until the Annual shareholders meeting, we are currently (as far as I know) still waiting on the Proxy voting statements to come in so we don't know what will be discussed there and what will be discussed beforehand.\n\nAlso a [Bloomberg drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrnte4/150421_gme_bloomberg_terminal_information/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[and a post about IV being over a 1000%](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrq5pq/attention_implicit_volatility_on_800_cs_set_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) holy fuck...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yyoisg97it61.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=85f28979804a551a9a0da4b58cf3c1e33ab788fd\n\n# EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uri8mjgc7it61.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=54d7afa9b173b7f75d08043c4fcb50beecc39754\n\nRemember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.\n\nbackups:\n\n[https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/](https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/HeyItsPixel1](https://twitter.com/HeyItsPixel1)\n\n[https://twitter.com/warden\\_elite](https://twitter.com/warden_elite)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\nAnd I'll be posting updates as they happen here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd please remember we don't know what the next few days will bring, they are exciting but we have gotten our hopes up before so please temper them, relax and try to take your mind off of things this weekend.
