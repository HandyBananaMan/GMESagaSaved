    "selftext": "\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. sold $US13 billion ($16.8 billion) of bonds on Thursday (US time), the largest deal ever by a bank, taking advantage of some of the cheapest borrowing costs in years to boost its capital after the Federal Reserve let pandemic relief measures lapse.\n\nThe deal, which followed the bank\u2019s best quarter ever, hit the market as corporate borrowers continue to see heavy demand for debt that provides a decent premium over Treasuries. Order books grew to about $US26 billion, allowing JPMorgan to trim the interest on the debt from the relatively high spreads it initially offered, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nhttps://www.google.com.tw/amp/s/amp.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/jpmorgan-sells-16-8b-in-bonds-in-largest-bank-deal-ever-20210416-p57jqa.html",
