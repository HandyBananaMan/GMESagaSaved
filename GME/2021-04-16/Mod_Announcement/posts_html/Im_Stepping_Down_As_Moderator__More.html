<p>I joined GME in January like most of us after WSB's overnight coup and crypto scam surfaced while being infiltrated with unmoderated shills. I had a lot of time on my hands back then before the baby was born - I was hunting down &amp; reading every single piece of DD related to GME, but everything I read was going out the window when shill waves pushed FUD. I never sold but noticed how panic creeps in and I forget all that knowledge. So I started collecting everything that I read to not forget what I learned when FUD kicks in and balance the pros vs the cons during panic. It made a huge difference to my morale on bad days, to the point that I could easily manage to clear the minds of those that were falling for FUD and panicking.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks in, I decided to publish my collection, so I set up the DD list post on rGME and volunteered to moderate through modmail. I was accepted and was absolutely ecstatic to be on the frontline banning HF footsoldiers (plants), shill recruiters, spammers, scammers, harassers, and just straight-up assholes that wanted to trick others. It was enjoyable, not that much of a handful back then, and very very satisfying work. I don’t know if you can understand what it means to protect tens of thousands of users from the shadows, and I’m sure it’s not for everyone, but I felt truly proud of myself for making a difference to the little guy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over the next period of weeks the sub started to change into something very concerning: huge influx of shill accounts, scamming predators luring people through charity groups &amp; spreading FUD about the sub to push users to join their groups, tons of alt accounts (not shills) ready to push a narrative through up/down voting and spamming slightly different comments with the same mentalities meant to convince users that everyone around them is thinking the same thing when it's actually just a handful of assholes with thousands of accounts, OG mods became inactive, and clashes between now ex-mods which leaked out. I'm relieved that so many of you noticed these things for yourselves and shared the info around to others for awareness’s sake.</p>
<p>It took a lot of work to combat these growing concerns, and slowly the sub started shifting into something that I'm now not comfortable being a part of. I initially got into this to make sure misinformation doesn't spread and that good DD is vetted, but responsibilities dealing with the rest of these concerns started taking over priority, and it became too much very fast.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last 50 days, along with the insane amount of weight a stay-at-home dad with a fresh newborn has to bear, my willpower was draining, I started losing my temper, I stopped tending to IRL relationships, and put myself in a vicious cycle of self-destruction. In short: I got burned out.</p>
<p>Following recent events the OG mods decided to finally step in. After they decided to not stay in the loop even though all mods and now ex-mods tried to rope them in continuously through group chats, they were clearly uninformed of the whole situation and put out statements which make it seem like they have a handle of things, when we know they didn’t.  They made changes to the sub which showed that they do not. They reverted keyword-removals that puts the sub in jeopardy such as the r- word, and keywords relating to scams happening right now all across stock subreddits (such as 'decentralized WBS' that surfaced during the Jan coup), and basically reverted the weeks of sweaty work we all put in to protect you guys.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one OG mod admitted that they have been in contact with some known suspicious users and have been receiving suggestions on how to operate the sub, and then executing those suggestions. At this point we're unsure if those actions are intentional or innocent, but with other recent events, I personally feel it's in my best interests to cut ties for my own sake.</p>
<p>So I’ve made my decision. I'm done swimming against the current and getting nowhere fighting internally only to end up not being able to protect users. I am unhappy with how this sub and other related subs are changing into something which puts retail investors in very vulnerable positions, as we saw what happened with the SEC comments and many other reasons that could potentially lead to these very same subs get investigated for retail investor collusion. Meanwhile, my IRL responsibilities need tending to which takes much of my energy and leaves me drained from being able to keep argumenting in-house to do what is right to the point that I end up wasting the little energy left in me and end up doing barely any needed work. I believe that people with fewer responsibilities than me and more time on their hands can do a better job and I leave it to them.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I am not done fighting against misinformation. I will continue to urge you to read, question, and review everything that <strong>anyone</strong> posts on reddit. I will continue to remind you to make the effort to not fall onto any conclusions before you doubt everything you ever read on any sub. To DD, discuss &amp; cross-review all information yourselves, no matter how trusted you believe the poster to be. There are people here with agendas, who may seem sweet and helpful on the outside, but are sharks on the inside waiting for the right moment to screw you over. However, I will not continue to do any of that on rGME, as I no longer want to be associated with it or any other existing sub related to it which is the home of these very same crooks.</p>
<p>I have decided to open a new sub dedicated to the provision and discussion of <strong>truthful</strong> information related to GameStop stock ($GME) with one cause:</p>
<p>To protect all shareholders of GME through education &amp; research meant to put a spotlight on the truth while exposing criminal activity: market manipulation, pump &amp; dump schemes, scams, collusion, FUD, and others.</p>
<p>I primarily browsed rGME for quality DD and I realized that many people did the same thing and wanted a space free from anything else. It just made sense to separate entertainment from information, and this is what encouraged me to put in the work and set it all up.</p>
<p>Instead of being a jack of all trades sub like the rest, our focus is information and discussion. No memes, shitposts, or entertainment posts will be allowed to flood the feed &amp; encourage users to turn their brain off before they scroll to a deep dive post, at which point not having the will to read a page of text and just say "<em>meh, fuck it, I’ll just let other users guide me about what to do and believe when info get popular and floods the feed</em>."</p>
<p>So to combat misinformation and criminal activity the sub is set to post-restricted. What this means is that the public can comment freely, but <strong>submitting a post requires pre-approval by a team of DD reviewers before it is made public.</strong></p>
<p>This is to ensure that no published post contains misinformation or unstated speculation so that readers can easily distinguish between hard-fact and theory/opinion. This also makes it easy for mods to identify criminal activity such as market manipulating FUD &amp; scams, thereby safeguarding readers from being tricked with bullshit.</p>
<p>The DD Vets remain unbiased about the content of any submission during review. We merely ask for evidence to back statements, opinions, and speculation - and when unavailable we ask the author to state the information for what it is. It is clear that the most valuable DD challenges existing viewpoints with new evidence, and the last thing we want is to turn into an echo chamber of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the best way forward to fight against the recent unmanageable spreading of misinformation all across reddit.</p>
<p>So I bid you adieu, and hope to see you on the other side!</p>

<p><em>N.B. - For those that stuck by me through this dark time, I want to express how much I love you guys. My strength and willpower have never been tested this hard, but each one of you who messaged me with encouragement &amp; support gave me a second wind every time, without which I wouldn’t have gotten to this point right now. I needed your rays of light much more than you could possibly imagine.</em></p>
<h1>Edit</h1>
<p><strong>Clarification for those that think it's hypocritical that I felt overwhelmed modding rGME and stepped down only to set up another sub</strong></p>
<p>The overwhelming part about modding GME was handling hassle due to disorganization &amp; miscommunication in dealing with essential work. The part I enjoyed was always DD vetting which I will be doing almost exclusively in r/DDintoGME.</p>
<p>The mod team has split responsibilities and everyone will be doing what they enjoy and chose, with new mods already in mind to join on the day if the work starts getting overwhelming. We're creating a stress-free self-running engine where everyone has a part, rather than a free-for-all method where everyone bears all the weight, which I have been experiencing here.</p>
<p>But regardless; haters gonna hate no matter what we say. If you dislike what you're reading and think it's <em>just drama and powerhunger</em> - you don't see the point and I am done explaining. Just close the thread and ignore the new sub, because it clearly isn't for you.</p>
<p>I'll be on the other side encouraging &amp; helping our whole community to get educated. This is my last post, edit, and comment here.</p>
