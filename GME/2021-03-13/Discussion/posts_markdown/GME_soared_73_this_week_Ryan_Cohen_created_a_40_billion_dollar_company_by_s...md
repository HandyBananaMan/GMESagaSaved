I will rank them based on the IQ of the tactic.

1. **0 IQ:** Melvin said they had closed the positions on GME and silver was pumped. Really, how much more boomer can you get than to recommend silver to apes?
2. **5 IQ:** Brokerages prevented us from opening positions. This straight up illegal move caused such a momentum shift that they had me in the first half, not gonna lie. Yet, here we are consolidated at $267 per each share. I can assure you brokerages will think twice before engaging in this fuckery again.
3. **0 IQ:** Media and that Cramer bitch originally blasted GME daily. As we know now, all this did was grab the attention of even more people. Whether the majority of these are paper hands, reporting about GME on the news OBVIOUSLY has not worked in their favor in any capacity. Media has recently been more silent about GME than is warranted.
4. **negative IQ:** Low effort bots and shills were seen widespread. I'm still laughing over $CUM in the $ASS, and the paid shills from 3rd world countries who probably have no idea what the fuck shorting even means.

On a quick side note: I transferred all my GME out of RH and into Fidelity last week. The transfer took a total of 3 days to see my 80 shares into Fidelity. I want to hold my investment across multiple brokerages so that I don't have "inconvenient" outages when the MOASS comes. To see a list of brokerages that did not restrict GME trading back in January, read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend\_gme\_thread\_homework\_for\_all\_lets\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/)

Desperation has sunk in for Melvin and Co. I don't know if they've been hiring psychologists with pHDs, but their recent tactics actually seem to have a couple of brain cells in them. Over the last month, they did the following:

1. **30 IQ:** A likely chance that WSB mods were paid off. Megathreads about GME were purposely not created and folks are getting silenced with bans. However, it seems like the bullish sentiment for GME has not departed thanks to the daily spicy GME memes, bullish DDs, and the GME megathread making it to the front page every day.
2. **20 IQ:** They decided to pump Rocket while dumping GME concurrently. It's fucking ironic they thought I would be stupid enough to leave GME and jump over to Rocket. Still, I'll give some credit to them for the coordinated effort. Rocket is now up 16% month-to-month. If you want an easy 16%, just buy the tech dip or pay off your credit card.
3. **10 IQ:** Shills pretending to be ex-military and good samatarians by planning to sell at $1000 in order to buy a nice house for their mom or donate. Admittedly, these posts appealed to my sympathy and was heart warming, but they must actually be clueless if they think they can buy such a house with 80-90 shares at $1000.
4. **negative IQ:** Melvin reporting a 20% gain last month. I'm only an ape in dental school, but if I originally had $100, lost 50%, and then gained 20%, I would end with $60. Nice flex but okay. 
5. **90 IQ:** Their **most effective strategy** currently seems to involve hiring shills who actually know something about the situation to spread FUD. These so-called DD's are well-written, coherent, and rational, which naturally captures our belief. It is a very powerful manipulation technique. **Ever heard of reverse psychology?** **YOU are getting reverse psychologyed motherfucker** because while they appear to support GME and are prompting you to hold in the meantime, their DDs have lightly sprinkled doubts and uncertainty. So while they appear to be long GME, you now have a sense of uncertainty such that any changes to the GME situation can and will easily persuade you to sell. 

Now, I don't know if short interest is actually much higher or lower than reported. All I am certain of is this:

**If the hedges aren't screwed in some conceivable way, why would they spend tens, even hundreds, of millions to scare us. If their positions were already covered, are they just flushing money down the toilet to spite us?** Keep this thought in mind.

Edit 1: 

tldr: BUY and HOLD. The rocket has never looked more ready than before
