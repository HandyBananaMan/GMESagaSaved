You will be hated here. Hell, you already are. Next week we might hit 400+ and the last thing we need is a ceiling of 420 USD and then 420 EUR (500 USD). We need the gamma squeeze. The meme number that you want is 420,694.20. It's the ultimate alpha chad overlord meme number and no one will hate you for it.

Take off the fucking limit sell and if you MUST limit sell at a meme number, then post it way higher. Apes together strong, this isn't financial/investment advice, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, crayon milkshake, etc.
