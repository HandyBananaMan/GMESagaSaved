    "selftext": "I'm no financial advisor, this is not financial advice. I honestly have no clue about all of this and just dumped more than I can afford to lose into GME based on DD over here. This is me pointing out imho obvious faults in others DD. ^(Edit1: still happy with my GME positions, don't mean to put any blame on those who wrote the proper DD on which base I opened them!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently every other DD claims that customer funds of 401k's are moved from Melvin to elsewhere, to protect them in \"the upcoming bankruptcy\".\n\n\\> ~~[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3xb8r/strap\\_in\\_and\\_open\\_wide\\_titfuckers\\_im\\_about\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3xb8r/strap_in_and_open_wide_titfuckers_im_about_to/) point #5 for example~~\nEDIT3: this was corrected eventually, thanks.\n\nThey all point to [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin\\_capital\\_potentially\\_moving\\_investors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin_capital_potentially_moving_investors/) who first made this claim pointing to a PDF which is not ultra-easy accessible, so a few apes might not have figured out how to actually view the \"evidence\".\n\nIf you somehow magically manage to download the PDF you will see, as pointed out by enough others, that the 401k's were transferred away from wells fargo.... How can this \"accidentally\" be misattributed to Melvin? Just because they hold shares in one of the involved companies, THIS IS NOT MOVING FUNDS FROM MELVIN TO ELSEWHERE.\n\nAlso the whole concept of \"Melvin moving customer funds to protect them\" sounds rather laughable, like they would care.\n\nOf course it was pointed out in the original DD (EDIT3: by u/the_captain_slog) that the claims are bullshit, as the 401k's were never held by Melvin in the first place [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin\\_capital\\_potentially\\_moving\\_investors/gqqguz7/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin_capital_potentially_moving_investors/gqqguz7/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nAnd also in the latest \"DD\" [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3xb8r/strap\\_in\\_and\\_open\\_wide\\_titfuckers\\_im\\_about\\_to/gqrl6wr/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3xb8r/strap_in_and_open_wide_titfuckers_im_about_to/gqrl6wr/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut seems to be ignored by OPs, which makes me doubt their honesty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT0**: Contributing to the honesty doubts, let me quote u/Starhammer4Billion \\[[\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m45kdr/dd_401ks_are_not_moving/gqsrt0i/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\]\n\n>The OP and the poster that cheers him on are both fresh 1 Month Accounts.I suspect shills trying to \"divide and Conquer\" with made up good news.Designed to later pull the rug with disproven good news and new bad news, I suspect.Shills are: trollwallstreet and  Ok\\_Safety\\_7710\n\n**EDIT2:** No, this has no impact on my GME sentiment, still bullish AF. Apes who bought thier stonks based on the 401k DD should see a professional brain-wrinkler. Just pointing it out to expose shills and spreaders of lies.",
