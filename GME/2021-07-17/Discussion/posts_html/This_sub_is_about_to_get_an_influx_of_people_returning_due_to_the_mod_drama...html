<p>And please don't allow any shill campaigns that attack your mods to work. Screenshot everything. Accept absolutely no drama or harassment. Also, please don't mod random people just because they're funny (i.e. /u/buttfarm69 - no offense to him but this is a terrible justification for modding).  </p>
<p>One final request: <strong>Accurate DD needs to be the sole focus of the sub</strong>. This will help newcomers get accustomed and get all of the info they need to comfortably invest. Please don't let this get overrun with memes.</p>
