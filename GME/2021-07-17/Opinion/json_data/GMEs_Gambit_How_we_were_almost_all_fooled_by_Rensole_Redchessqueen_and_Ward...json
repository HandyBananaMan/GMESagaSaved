Unravelling a professional undercover plot is significantly harder than recognizing amateur manipulation.\n\nWhen an undercover operative first approaches a community they intend to infiltrate, there are a few specific things they will do to ensure they are not suspected from the start, as well as some notable behaviors they may exhibit over time. Understanding these can make them possible to spot, and while they definitely don\u2019t guarantee that someone is an undercover, they do serve as good indicators.\n\n**General indicators of an undercover:**\n\n1. **Having an uncanny but powerful charisma about them, though often expressed subtly.** Meeting a professional manipulator \u2018in character\u2019 is a truly bizarre experience in hindsight. Essentially it feels like encountering someone for the first time that you\u2019ve somehow already known your entire life. Their subtle behaviours, such as vocal inflections, mannerisms and facial expressions, feel weirdly familiar, almost nostalgic, as if from someone you knew from before you can remember. Most people are put at ease by this, becoming more relaxed and open, but if you look very carefully (without making them aware you are doing this), it is sometimes possible to detect the inauthenticity just beneath the superficial surface.\n2. **Being keen to provide upfront explanation (justification) for any character incongruities in their appearance, behavior, or backstory.** This is to cover anything that may otherwise make them look out of place in the community, and the explanations given will ultimately be unverifiable \u2013 it may be technically possible to prove, but this proof itself is either implausible to obtain, or could be easily faked.\n3. **Being vague or evasive about their history, and providing unsubstantiated and unverifiable \u2018facts\u2019 that aren\u2019t positively reflected in their character.** This is important, as being vague means no truth is committed to \u2013 they can be more flexible later if needed, and are less likely to be caught contradicting themselves. When (gently and carefully) pushed, they will typically produce something more, but once they say anything concrete it can\u2019t be undone, so it must be committed to memory.\n4. **Sometimes in crucial conversations, particularly when discussing activist-related theory or personal motivations, they sound more like they\u2019re speaking from memory than intuition.** This one is very difficult to describe, but basically their speech will be slightly more uniform and consistent in an uncanny way, as well as subtly \u2018flat\u2019 sounding \u2013 relative to how they regularly speak, of course. Basically, it will sound rehearsed. On the other hand, if someone really believes in the ideas and goals of the group they\u2019re in, this is usually apparent in the enthusiasm and spontaneous energy in their language.\n5. **Doing something illegal early on**. Most people naturally find it difficult to believe someone could be a cop if they, for example, take hard drugs, vandalize a bank, or fight other cops in the street (all happened btw). The crime(s) will be done with or in front of trusted members of the community, who then become believable accounts that \u2018prove\u2019 the undercover can also be trusted.\n6. **Taking on a workload, or demonstrating a skill-set, that is disproportionately greater than what can normally be expected.** Any undercover cop will have a small team working behind the scenes to provide them with intelligence briefings, character guidance, and supporting materials. Accordingly, undercover cops will often seem to become surprisingly good at everything within just a short period of time, and will simply be able to get more stuff done than others can.\n7. **Providing somewhat different behavioral narratives (including stated motivations, desires and goals) to different people, then performing actions that are subtly inconsistent with all of them, but still technically \u2018fit\u2019.** In other words, they are two-faced, but very good at getting away with it. This is how it appears when someone is setting narrative absences while masking their behavioral anomalies in a cohered manner. This can be particularly difficult to spot, but having information from multiple perspectives can make it easier\u2026 Assuming you know the people you\u2019re conferring with aren\u2019t undercovers as well.\n8. **Bringing more sus people in. Getting the first undercover inside is the hardest part, but once one cop is reasonably trusted they can start slowly introducing others**. These additional undercovers can often be even more suspect and unverifiable than the original, because a key aspect of their trustworthiness is they already know someone \u2018trusted\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrg0kf6rnub71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=73286094d5d65580ca70ed0f3608e7825e189f86\n\n**It is a common misconception,** often reinforced in the Hollywood spy genre, **that undercovers work alone. In reality, undercovers rarely work alone; where there is one, there are others to back them up and support them**. Once they are settled into the community, they don\u2019t stop there either, as the eventual aim is for them to have full control. This usually comes about through a structured pattern of sowing confusion, manipulating inter-personal drama, then initiating a significant event that will (to the keen eye) usually resemble a ploy of some kind. This can be a soft organizational coup, but most of the time members are too wary to let something like that happen. More often, undercovers instead gain control of the community by engineering a conflict, instigating a split, and forming a new group where they informally take charge. The greater the outrage they can manufacture against the original group, and the more people they can bring over to the new one, the greater the success of the operation. Does this sound familiar?\n\nIn the build-up to the ploy, **undercovers will typically fall into either a general \u2018leader\u2019 or \u2018support\u2019 role.**\n\n**The leader is the most common role for an undercover,** and in my experience they are usually cisgender males. While they may begin as a fairly quiet background character, their final form is never simply a lurker; their goal is not merely to observe, but to influence. For example, in activist groups, surprisingly it is frequently the most militant, active and \u2018with it\u2019 people that turn out to be cops (not saying most active militants are cops, but that most undercovers perform as active militants). They do this to position themselves as an informal leader within an otherwise leaderless organization, and steer the group towards their own ends.\n\n**Two indicators for a leading undercover:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkotl3rrnub71.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0745003e242374f513a0531023dcd09b1d03ff1\n\n**9) Controlling the discourse**. What they say may not always make the most sense, but they will be vocal, persuasive, and project a vibe of authority without really seeming to try. They are often keen to chair meetings, plan agendas, and finalize written statements. Basically they tend to get their own way without it coming across like that.\n\n**10) Accruing status, and then choosing to utilize it.** This is one of the late signs of power formation, and may be difficult to reverse once it has gotten this far. At this point, they are not yet properly in the position of informal leadership, but they likely hold a small sphere of influence within the wider community. Behaviors will include gently pushing people towards actions they may not wish to take otherwise, passively dominating decision making through having multiple allies, and carefully praising or rewarding people *as if* they are an authority.\n\n**For a leading undercover, general indicators tend to be possible to spot because they\u2019re always ultimately trying to achieve something overarching, rather than simply vibing while having personal goals.** They swim upstream, so cannot help but be in motion \u2013 we can detect this motion. Also because their true motivations are concealed, we can expect to see their \u2018character arc\u2019 evolve in a slightly incoherent and disjointed manner. Once the ploy is revealed, it may be possible to reasonably confirm they are an undercover, but until that moment it\u2019s all just suspicions \u2013 hence why these cases are rarely solved until too late.\n\n**The support is the next most common role adopted by an undercover, and they only ever exist in relation to an undercover leader**. They tend to be more difficult to identify, as their primary narrative functions tend to be indirect and less obvious. Typically their purpose is to facilitate the leading undercover in positioning themselves as a leader, while minimizing suspicion against both of them. It is common for a support character to act in a romantic relationship with their respective leader.\n\n**Some indicators for a supporting undercover:**\n\n**11) Humanizing a suspect leader.** This includes confirming their context and background (\u201cOh yeah we go way back, we actually met on a bus in 2013...\u201d), discussing their character while they aren\u2019t around (not necessarily in an entirely positive way, just talking about them as if they\u2019re real), and publicly performing (rehearsed) dialogues allowing the leader to temporarily appear vulnerable or flawed in a controlled setting.\n\n**12) Giving frequent explanation and excuses for a suspect leader\u2019s behavior.** \u201cHow come you\u2019re saying this now when a month ago you said the opposite?\u201d; \u201cAmazing how you\u2019re able to do so much organizing and still hold down a full-time job \u2013 where is it you work again?\u201d; \u201cWoah, where did you get all this great intel from anyway?\u201d If the leader is constantly seen as being on the defensive and having to justify themselves, it raises suspicions. A support can jump in to respond, or more commonly, anticipate questions that are likely to be asked, then provide answers upfront and unprompted during semi-related discussion when the leader isn\u2019t around.\n\n**13) Consistently upholding a suspect leader\u2019s account of the truth.** This means siding with them during simple \u2018he said, she said\u2019 disagreements, helping twist current narratives to align with the leader\u2019s goals, and including the same crucial, fabricated detail(s) when recounting historical events.\n\n**Support indicators are much harder to spot**, mostly because they are so benign at face value, and can all be easily misattributed to any normal person. Before the ploy takes place, a support undercover will effectively only be suspect through their proximal relationship to a much more suspect leading undercover \u2013 suspicion through overly-convenient association. Once the ploy is executed, then it becomes more clear who the support undercovers are, as they tend to play a central role in whatever transpires \u2013 guilt through being complicit.\n\n**There are two other types of undercover cop roles I have noted in the past.**\n\n**The \u2018device/diversion\u2019 undercover is an actor with a more specific role, usually revolved around indirectly facilitating the ploy in some way**. By basically only being an object in the plan, it usually doesn\u2019t matter how suspect they are, as they are not visibly moving anything along. This means they can also serve effectively as a punching-bag for suspicions, as for some reason most regular people in these situations tend to only be suspicious of one person at a time. They can usually be identified by general indicators.\n\n**The final type is \u2018monitor\u2019. This is an undercover role that is generally assumed to exist, but it\u2019s almost impossible to tell who they may be.** Their entire purpose is to simply exist in the background, watching everything happen, and memorizing as much key information as possible. They will typically be someone unassuming, quiet, and boring. This won\u2019t be relevant to our situation here, as Reddit is already a public platform.\n\n**The fact we\u2019re dealing with a potential manipulation in the digital world does somewhat alter the playing field.** Indicator 1 will be impossible to find, as this can only be seen during direct face-to-face contact. It will be substantially harder to identify indicator 4, as only having access to recorded audio means a lot of quality is lost. I also cannot say much for indicator 8 because I was not close to the mod team at all. However, since everything is publicly available and stored for later viewing, indicator 7 should be easier to spot.\n\n\\*\\*Now that you have an idea of how these people behave, let's dig into it.The perpetrators.
