<p>Ape Festival and its organizers can go to hell, but I just wanted to highlight some off the bullshit tactics around the Ape Festival website.</p>
<p>I've been on this AF website for about an hour now, and it is incessantly telling me about all of the other people who have bought festival tickets...</p>
<p><img alt="Nobody bought shit 31 minutes ago. Fuck you." src="https://preview.redd.it/9z6oe9mmfpb71.png?width=1596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d69da9dd00459d579567d90851d0ef907343dcc" /></p>
<p>See the popup in the bottom left corner? It appears every few seconds. This is a marketing strategy to elicit feelings of FOMO so that everyone buys.</p>
<p>I traced the code, and the Ape Festival animals are running <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/recent-sales-popup-notifications-1/reviews?page=2">this plugin</a>, which describes itself as "social proof, sales popup urgency, stock countdown timer, FOMO."</p>
<p>Remember when I said I was on the site for more than an hour? The stock for all items have been listed as "sold out" -- all tickets, all sizes. See below for ticket types (you can verify sizes are sold out when you click into them, but I'm not going to post 20 screenshots):</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="No, nobody bought shit 37 minutes ago either. Fuck you." src="https://preview.redd.it/o9srpvzmgpb71.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40f54fba6c182ae906129ded88c2f985b314962e" /></p>
<p>So riddle me this:</p>
<p>1) How are there popups showing up that say a package was purchased in the last 31-37 minutes? (I purposely included that in the screenshot above)</p>
<p>2) How is my browser receiving this "live data" if my chrome developer tools (right side) is not showing any network activity being sent to my browser?</p>
<p>Just beware. The website was not created innocently. It is all being driven to manipulate apes. You all already know this, but I just wanted to provide a perspective from looking at their code, and tracing the network. Fuck these guys and see you all on the moon, where we will all celebrate together in spirit.</p>
