Hello fellow apes,

Lets calculate the retail ownership using in my view conservative estimates and public available information.   


 The Swedish broker Avanza states that currently as of latest Friday that 22 268 clients hold GME. (1)  


![Number of Avanza clients holding GME](https://preview.redd.it/p2j129gw72n61.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=f720a77e0621d6a81281d37b3224ca3906260460)

Avanza have 1.4M customers (2) but they are not only focused on trading and it is a popular broker in Sweden (my parents have it and my grandmother). In total then 1.6% of Avanza customers hold GameStop. It might sound low, but this is Sweden not US 

Another broker that provides this data is Trading 212. I could not access this data without opening an account with them. But this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m47jv3/50000\_uk\_holders\_on\_one\_broker/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m47jv3/50000_uk_holders_on_one_broker/)

Shows that 49,5K are holding GameStop. Given Avanza numbers it seems legit.

Trading 212 have 1.5M users according to their Tweet from Feb 18 (3). This results in that 3.3% of their clients are holding GameStop. Trading 212 is primarily a UK trading broker. 

  
**Average position size?**

![Avanza employee informing average position size in GME](https://preview.redd.it/mty4z0ae82n61.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=3217ed74382abf63b442f88bfc736ec41a282de2)

The above is Swedish. Nicklas Andersson works at Avanza and February 2 said that the average GME position size in dollar amount was18K SEK converted to USD it is $2100 among Avanza clients. Tweet link (4).

This average position size in $amount is in line with what Citadel, Kenneth Griffin told us in the Congressional Hearing 2/18/21. At the 2H:00 mark he said that the “typical robinhood order is ballpark around $2000 dollars. “ (5) Matches up very well with the Avanza number.

**Time to Calculate** 

I did a table including different brokers with their total users and a percentage holding GME of 3.3% from Trading212 used for European and US brokers, except Avanza and Nordnet where the 1.6% number is used. 

This is still probably quite conservative numbers even using the 3.3% number given that US brokers probably are higher than 3.3%. I have used an average position size in dollars of $2000 and the average GME stock price at $200 which is quite conservative given that the stock price was quite recently much lower. Leading to that the average GME holder have 10 shares.

&#x200B;

![The table ](https://preview.redd.it/fgik8kx792n61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=4730068b79566ad2b82588ac6cf9962cf611b740)

The links to where the total user data have been gathered can be find in the references (6-18).

This leads to a total of **40.8M** shares for retail. Not all brokers are included in the table.

The percentage holding for US brokers are using the percentage from Trading212 a UK broker. This is probably low given that all this GameStop action takes place in US, congressional hearing, Wall street, Robinhood yeah you apes get it. 

The average share price of $200 is quite high and the position size average was before even I fully understand this GME situation, since then I have increased my position significantly. And now add the incoming stimulus check and the share retail owns will be even higher.

**TLDR:** Apes/Retail owns a shit ton of GME, probably already own GameStop. Using conservative estimates and not including all data I arrived at 40.8M GME Shares owned by retail.   
 

**Diamond Hands. To the Moon.**    




Edit: Some have informed me that Trading212 is mostly young investors and not very conservative, although it is a UK broker and not US broker (probably more GME holders in the states). All brokers are not even included so the numbers of shares retail own are still probably way higher in reality. But to give all the data.

Using the average of Avanza and Trading 212 (2.45%) in the table it gives a total of 30.65M shares. Using the number from Avanza of 1.6% it gives a total of 20M.
  

Edit 2:  One helpful user in the comment posted this link that is from February 22. Interesting to look at. 

https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/gme-data

It states that 14% of wealthsimples clients invested in GME. This is in line with my thinking that the % holding GME probably higher closer to US.
