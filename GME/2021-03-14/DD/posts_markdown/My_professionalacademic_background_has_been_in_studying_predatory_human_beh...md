This is indicative of a number of things, but primarily that they are COMPLETELY FUCKED, and that THE SHORT SQUEEZE IS STILL PROBABLE.

So, where to start – first off, been lurking here for the last couple months, I FOMO’d at the end of January along with a whole lot of other people, before watching the crash down to 38 where I took the opportunity to average down. This started off for me as “fuck you” to spite RobinHood and the Shorts after I watched a YOLO I had put into *American-fucking-Airlines* crash hard when they shut down our trading. I apologize in advance for what is probably going to be a lot of words.

This is certainly not financial advice, as I am the furthest thing possible from a sound financial advisor. My personal life is a fucking train wreck, I have plenty of vices I battle with, to include drinking constantly and eating crayons, and I suck at picking stocks. Before all this I was down tens of thousands in the market. Never heard about WSB or what was going on here until I saw some buddies mention it on social media. But I’ve always been pretty good at math, and analysis of human behavior and the human condition.

My professional background is in the military, and I’ve been to some very interesting places and gotten to do some very interesting things in my life. I’m not in counterintelligence but the nature of my past positions has had me working with/around those folks for years, and I like to think I managed to learn some valuable lessons along the way. One of my main roles previously required me to constantly study and analyze **how certain adversaries think and fight**, and develop counter-tactics to beat them at their own game when/if a war kicks off. Not much more I can say on that subject. It is generally my nature to keep such things about myself to myself and those close to me, but I’m hoping I can highlight some things to you retarded Apes, particularly the newest among us who recently FOMO’d and are at highest risk of eventually paper-handing.

Little more about me, so you know this isn’t just bullshit from some conspiracy theorist dude in his mom’s basement – I have a Master’s degree and two doctorates that pertain highly to human behavioral analysis. In my external postgraduate studies, I have specialized in a couple different areas – human sexuality and human history in particular. I firmly believe that if you want to understand human beings and what drives them, you should study those two subjects – psychology, sociology and the rest are more or less built on the foundations of those two areas. As a sex researcher, I have studied some of the worst types of predators on this planet – types with no regard for human life, who do unspeakable things – and how their minds work. My counterintel exposure always helped me to make better sense of it all. So I have learned a **WHOLE LOT** about predators and ***how they*** ***operate*** over the last decade.

When I went all in on GeeEmEe, it was because I noticed **patterns of behavior** that the HFs have been exhibiting, which is typical of predator behavior seen in individuals known as Cluster B psychopaths.

**WHAT IS A CLUSTER B PSYCHOPATH?**

Glad you asked. Okay, don’t want to get overly technical on you but the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) lists Cluster B’s as such:**

**Cluster B:**  A person with this type disorder has difficulties regulating their emotions and behavior. Others may consider their behavior dramatic, emotional, or erratic. There are four cluster B disorders: **antisocial**, **borderline**, **histrionic**, and **narcissistic** personality disorders. 

Individuals can sometimes exhibit combined traits of two or more of these, but SOME of those Cluster B traits include:

&amp;#x200B;

* **manipulative or deceitful behavior for personal gain****, such as lying or assuming false identities**
* **repeated antisocial actions, such as harassment or theft**
* **irresponsible actions****, which can affect occupational, social, and financial aspects of life**
* **disregard for personal safety or the safety of others**
* **using dramatic, theatrical expressions and emphasis when expressing emotion**
* **a pattern of self-important or grandiose behavior, such as exaggerating achievements      and** **expecting to be recognized as superior**
* **fantasies of unlimited success, power**
* **a belief of importance, specialness, and uniqueness that only other high-status people can      understand**
* **a need for excessive admiration**
* **a sense of entitlement, such as unreasonable expectations of favorable treatment**
* **a tendency to take advantage of others for personal gain**
* **a lack of empathy**
* **arrogant, condescending behaviors or attitudes**

Sound familiar??  Want the short (pun-intended) translation?  All this illegal, fucked up, manipulative, deceitful, rewriting-history bullshit that the hedgies are pulling??   **THAT IS HOW THEY THINK****.** **NATURALLY****.** **EVERY****.** **GODDAMN****.** **DAY****.**  This is all business as usual for them, only **THIS TIME,** *people who like the stock* of the Shorts’ ***would-be victim (GeeEmEe)*** have managed to catch their **BALLS IN A VISE.**

I’ll say it louder for the people in the back – THE HEDGE FUNDS, PARTICULARLY **THE SHORTS**, **ARE PREDATORS**. That is who you are fighting.

**AND LIKE ALL PREDATORS, THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO THEY** ***THINK*** **CAN’T/WON’T FIGHT BACK.**

So their behavior of targeting and destroying American companies, costing thousands of people their jobs, driving up homelessness and suicide rates, *is* their regular operating mode. They ***enjoy*** doing it. They experience **ELATION** from doing it, and the feeling of **POWER** that comes with that. They like to think that the whole world, and **all of us**, are they plaything. That’s what they **get off** to – that they are “above” the rules and the law, and *get away with it*. Let me remind you that Jeffrey Epstein was a Hedge Fund guy.

*Disclaimer:* I am **NOT for a moment** saying that *every* person that works at a HF is evil and/or a predator, but that **it is an environment** where predators that ***do*** work there can naturally **THRIVE** and **RISE TO THE TOP**, because their natural traits – their cunning, ruthlessness, narcissism, disregard for human life/wellbeing of others, skill at deceit, backstabbing, lying, manipulation, etc – all give them a **distinct tactical advantage** in clawing their way to the **top** of those organizations. A not-insignificant percentage of corporate CEOs display the same behavioral traits. **Think of them as “serial killers of finance”**, only their psychopathic disorders have manifested themselves differently – instead of killing people (directly) they’re killing companies and communities **for sport**.

So why do they continue to tangle? Why give a fuck about what a bunch of retarded Apes are doing? This is the good news for us, and their behavioral patterns have confirmed it for me. **WE –** ***YOU*** **– HAVE THE HIGH GROUND, AND THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING EVERYTHING TO GET YOU TO MOVE OFF OF IT.** **THEY DO NOT HAVE THE POWER RIGHT NOW**, which to them is an **unfathomably uncomfortable and unfamiliar position** to be in.  Meaning, ***THEY HAVE NOT COVERED THEIR SHORT POSITIONS***, and their actions are all but certain confirmation of that, at least by my retarded analysis.

For the benefit of some of our newer Apes, a small taste of what we’ve seen from the Shorts so far:

A) “Our short positions have been covered.” // “Our balls aren’t ACTUALLY caught in a vise, why don’t you run away before I club you over the head.” (Instilling fear that you can still be hurt badly, to scare you away from a position where you have the power to hurt *them*.)

B) “Lol you really are FUCKING RETARDS, the squeeze already happened!” // “You idiot, this vise isn’t even tightened down, I can pull my balls away *easily*, and then I’ve got you!” (Belittlement to destroy self-confidence by sowing doubt/uncertainty of the strength of your position.)

C) “WSB/Retail cornering the helpless HFs was a calculated predatory move.” / “*I’M* not the predator, *YOU’RE* the predator! / “Slavery was a FAMILY business, I was never in it by choice! If-If anything, ***I’M*** the victim here!” // “You’re hurting my balls in this vise, *how could you* ***do that*** to another *human being*?” (Counteraccusation/Purported victimhood/Appealing to your decent human nature as a manipulation tactic to get your guard down, then brutally attacking you as soon as they’re free/regain the upper hand.)

So – now we’re down to one of the final, and **MOST DANGEROUS AND EFFECTIVE** tactics that they (Cluster B’s) ***LOVE*** to use… 

**THE WEAPONIZATION OF EMPATHY.** ***YOUR*** **EMPATHY.**

I have been genuinely touched by a lot of the stories and aspirations I have read by the people in this sub and over in WSB before it was compromised (now I’m far more wary of things over there, and even here – CHECK poster histories!). You retarded Apes are genuinely good human beings. I have felt more hope for humanity reading through this sub in the last few weeks than I’ve felt in a long time, and I say that as someone who has had their faith in humanity broken MANY, MANY times over. You really care about and want to help your families, friends, neighbors, communities, countries, planet, and each other. You have high ideals and aspirations for the good that you’ll be able to do, and most importantly, **high empathy**. **THIS IS WHAT THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE NOW TARGETING**. First off, please know that your empathy **does not make you weak**, it makes you a **better person**. Better than the Shorts, **by a lot**. You should never let yourself become like them, so I’m not saying you have to become coldly indifferent/try to block your own emotions. First off, that won’t work, because you’re wired with high empathy, as I said. Second, it’s not necessary. All that is necessary is that you RECOGNIZE their tactics **as they are happening** so you can RESPOND APPROPRIATELY.

If you read the above examples, here’s a new one: “Please, I have kids who will be affected when you take all of our money, this will hurt them!” // “I wasn’t sneaking into your house to hurt you, I was just trying to provide for my beloved family!” Just like the utter BULLSHIT pleading we saw posted the other day in the now-deleted link titled “PLEASE STOP. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS WRONG.”

In that post, “CityLady1” (seriously?) is trying to pull at your heartstrings and the whole “THINK OF THE CHILDREN” crock of shit she spins is a prime example. When psychopaths want to manipulate you, one of the FIRST things they will always pull out as a technique is to trigger our INNATE instinct to protect the young of our society. Think about your response when you hear a baby or child suddenly crying in fear or pain (assuming you yourself are not a psychopath) – you feel a STRONG pull to rush to help, and quickly look up or move in the direction of the sound. As humans, this is BUILT INTO OUR DNA, and elicits one of our **most powerful emotional responses**. They are trying to trigger that in you. We saw this with the whole “Save Our Children” campaign that was actually tricking a lot of people into spreading misinformation and Q Anon crap all over social media last year. It has been employed as a weapon by our adversaries to undermine public faith in our (U.S.A.’s) electoral system and overall system of governance, so that we are weakened within from infighting. We’ve seen those types of attacks on democratic republics around the globe. Now, the Shorts are trying to use it to weaken all of us Apes from within.

**“Love bombing”** is another tactic that uses your own empathy against you. Exploiting the endorphins you feel from **doing good things**, and also from positive connections and bonding. Predators, *particularly* Cluster B’s, will abuse victims *for years* – usually somebody physically, mentally, or emotionally vulnerable – causing incalculable damage and pain, both physical and psychological. When the victim is FINALLY able to fight back/call them out on their bullshit, the predator will *suddenly act* really sweetly and lovingly toward them, remind them of the “good experiences” from earlier in the relationship, etc, which is designed to confuse the victim, trigger endorphins, and pull them back into a cycle of abuse. This is an easy trap to fall for because as humans, **we innately need and seek connection** (which is also probably one of the reasons we all feel so drawn to this sub). My point here – I think that everybody wanting to help/sponsor animals, contribute to causes is great – again, it’s indicative of how much you care. However, I think there is a STRONG probability that the Shorts are using this sudden “saving animals” campaign to *seed the concept* of people exiting their positions earlier than they should. I mean, *“THINK OF ALL THE GOOD YOU COULD DO, WITH THE MONEY YOU’VE ALREADY MADE!”, and the accompanying* ***fear of potentially losing that ability to help****.* **The regular urgency we feel to help those around us who need it is what is being manipulated right now**. Thankfully I’ve seen most posts for adoptions etc as being 50 bucks here or there (not really a big deal IMO) but they will attempt to distract us and siphon off as much strength as they can to delay the Short Squeeze. Point is, they’re targeting our own goodwill toward one another here in the sub(s) in order to divide us, getting Apes to fight Apes over who’s right, after they very likely CREATED or **at the very least SEIZED UPON** this situation to do so. That is what predators do. They weaponize and exploit people’s *best* human traits against them.

The fact that they are using all of these tactics is nothing new to them, not in the stock market, not in life. But the sheer VOLUME of it all, measured against the media blackouts, blatant market manipulation, and other general tom-fuckery shows an increasing pattern of desperation and aggressiveness – there’s been plenty of other DD already pointing that out.

**TL;DR:** **Expect them to continue to** **fuck with your mind** and attempt to **weaponize your goodness and your empathy** against you.

**Some Suggested Counter-Tactics:**

**BUY AND HOLD, AND THEN BUY AND HOLD SOME MORE.** **THE NOOSE (OR VISE PER MY ABOVE EXAMPLE) IS TIGHTENING.**

**DON’T pin your hopes on specific DATES**, because your endorphins associated with those high hopes will *crash* if/when they manipulate the stock so that it doesn’t moon by those dates, and the negative chemicals/emotions you experience will work powerfully against you. The **MATH and DD of the Short Squeeze is solid** – there are plenty of Apes much smarter than me in that department whom have done fantastic DD (I feel like I’ve learned huge amounts more about the market since being here). Remember that **our emotions are the wild card**, which is why they are targeting THEM, and **they are naturally good at it** – it’s one of the last avenues they have since their traditional bag of stock manipulation tricks has been exposed and is falling flat. 

**DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANYBODY ASKING FOR IT ON THE SUBS**, for “petitions” or what the fuck ever. This includes **just your name, and your position/pricing on GME**. If I was on their side of this fight I’d be exploiting the SHIT out of data like that. You guys have heard of “phishing” I’m sure, but “spear-phishing” is a lot more dangerous, and allows them to isolate and target you directly. By letting your identity slip you make it way easier for them, and every other bad actor on the internet.

Take breaks. Plenty of people have already said this. **PATIENCE AND** **HOLDING** **IS KEY.** **EVEN IF IT TAKES WEEKS/MONTHS.** **YOU HAVE THEIR BALLS IN A VISE.** **NOT JUST THEM BUT THE CORRUPTION OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.** **DON’T. LET. THEM. GO****.** ***The Shorts are bleeding out.***

Lastly, remember the emotional tactics are being used **in concert with** all of their other, more mathematical, more definitively illegal methods, in order to “confirm” negative emotional reactions with “evidence” at the planned time. **DO NOT FALL FOR IT**. Stay retarded you fucking wonderful Apes.

P.S. If you’re a shill / manipulator / Hedge Fund Cluster B, fuck right off and don’t even bother DMing me. If you read my post and the *small* portion I shared about my professional and academic background, you should already know that I will see you coming a mile away because **hunting fuckers like you is my job**. **You don’t wanna come-a-knockin’.**
