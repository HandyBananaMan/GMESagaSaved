One of the most captivating things about this whole saga to me has been the absolute audacity of the coordination of the HFs and FIGHT on both sides of this.  Last Wednesday's chart was a beautiful mountain of tug of war.  This is (regardless of my financial interests) the most INTERESTING episode, possibly in the entirety of economic history.

Even though it feels tinfoil hat and confirmation bias as hell, last Friday's tweet from Game Stop with the picture of a CONTROLLER and a total of $250+15 indicated on it, and a closing share price of $264.50, the messaging of "Buy now Eat later"  I just have a really really really hard time thinking of that as a coincidence.  Logically it either MUST be coincidence or intentional.  I think the message we are getting is clear, "we are in control, don't worry, buy now, feast later, we got you"

This isn't from the viking, or Elon, or even RC, this is from GameStop itself, which I think is critical.  A lot of people have been asking for weeks/months "What if the company issues more shares?  What if they cut a deal with the HFs?  What if they do a weird split, vote the wrong way etc...what if they screw us???"

Here is why I think Game Stop, and Ryan Cohen are 100000% on our side, and it's pretty freaking simple.  Right now there are billions of dollars that are locked up in HF bank accounts, and other holdings, that Game Stop will never ever ever see.  They won't see it as investment, and they won't see it as income.  In fact, if it weren't for the current squeeze situation, if GME did a secondary offering, do you think anybody on the street would be buying in?  Maybe now with RC, but not if the old guard had their way.

However...WHEN the squeeze is over with, those billions will be in OUR hands.  We will KNOW that RC and Game Stop wanted that to happen, made sure it would happen and that is going to create the WEALTHIEST MOST LOYAL FANBASE OF ANY RETAILER ON THE PLANET.  Seriously, can you think of ANY retailer in any market that has that MANY rabidly loyal, dedicated, and wealthy customers?  How many of us have already pledged to spend hundreds of thousands at GME after the squeeze is squoze just to buy stuff to donate to needy kids or hospitals.  How many of us will want to be building tricked out gamer dens, top end PC rigs, filling out libraries of AAA titles etc...

Right now, cost is unfortunately more of a concern for me than brand loyalty, but there are companies that I am loyal to that I will ALWAYS buy from if they can compete on price.  If money is no longer an object because the squeeze was squoze, I can tell you with some certainty, if Game Stop sells something I want, it will be the only place I will buy those things for the rest of my life.  Ryan Cohen knows this, I think he's banking on it.

That's just from the profit side.  Let's look at the investment side.  Once the squeeze is squoze and the price settles down to a fair market valuation (I'm thinking around $1400) and I've gotten out my squeeze profits I am going STRAIGHT back in as a long, for all the reasons I stated above, as well as RC's vision for the company in general.  Moreover, if the board says "You know, how about we do a secondary offering of 10 million shares at 1k a piece" I as a shareholder will be THRILLED.  I'm not worried about dilution of 10 million shares added to the pool when that will put 10 billion into the company coffers.  10 billion could buy a lot of forward thinking investment.  I WILL be a long shareholder after the squeeze is squoze because Game Stop is going to absolutely dominate the gaming space with an army of loyal, wealthy shareholders who want it to succeed.

TLDR; RC and Game Stop want the squeeze to be squoze because it's going to turn is into a legion of money slinging GME supporting super apes who will also happily own stock in the company for the long haul.  Not worried about them cutting a deal or offering stock in any way that would prevent that from happening.

EDIT:  Edited to note that the coordination is on the HFs side.  I see the longs fighting, but I don't see coordination.  I just like the stock.

EDIT 2:  WOW!  Thank you all so much for the response.  I think this is important for very Ape to understand and the response to this post is more proof positive that GME is going to have fans in a way that no other retail ever will.  Stay strong my ape brothers and sisters, this is history I'm happy to be on the right side of.
