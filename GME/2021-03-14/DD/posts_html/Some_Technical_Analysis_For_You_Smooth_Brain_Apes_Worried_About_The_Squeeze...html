<h1>This is not financial advice, do your own DD. There is no date when the squeeze will squoze as long as we HODL the shorts will never win regardless of what the price is.</h1>

<p><strong>Alright boys and girls, here is some technical analysis on what I think is going to happen next week leading into quadruple witching day. If you’re looking at my chart the first initial gamma squeeze that took place back in late February, marked by the vertical green line, which caused us to pop to 200 and fall back to VWAP(turquoise line) followed by a week-long period of Consolidation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You can see the start of consolidation take place marked by the red vertical line. During this period you can see that the TTM Squeeze indicator goes red meaning we're prepping to springboard the fuck off. As consolidation occurs you can see the candles getting fucking squeezed into oblivion between the green upper Bollinger band and the yellow mid-Bollinger band as well as the EMA line. The following Monday, Tuesday, and mid-Wednesday we take off. Middle of Wednesday we get rejected hard off of 350 because of hedgie fuckery on purpose for a reason, more on this later.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We start to consolidate just like before after the first pop, you can see the green and red Bollinger bands are starting to come back in, consolidating and squeezing the candles. I've marked 2 channels where I think the price will stay until next week, the transparent red channel and the blue transparent channel.</strong></p>

<p>We will most likely stay within this channel all the way through Friday the 19th, quadruple witching day. <strong><em>THERE IS A REASON,</em></strong> on march 10th Wednesday we saw that massive drop, <strong><em>IT WAS ON PURPOSE</em></strong>, not for the reason you think. IT wasn't <strong><em>JUST</em></strong> to shake out paper hands, It was in my opinion to cause us to have a period of consolidation throughout next week. Do me a favor, count how many days after the first gamma squeeze did we have a period of consolidation.</p>
<p><strong><em>SEVEN</em></strong>, we had seven whole fucking days of consolidation after the first pop(2/25 - 3/05). I have a feeling they purposefully caused the major “crash” on Wednesday to stop the momentum from continuing and cause us to consolidate and began to squeeze for the entirety of next week through quadruple witching day. The reason is that they know a lot of people are hoping that on the 19th something happens. And if they can delay a pop all of next week through possible catalysts like the hearing on the 17th and quadruple witching day on the 19th then it will demoralize the fuck out of dumb apes on r/GME and other subs. Only the veteran apes know to HODL no matter what, as long as you have shares in your account the shorts will never win. PERIOD.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now for you smooth brain apes with shriveled up dicks that think the shorts will win, let me make this simple for you.</p>
<p>EVEN IF and that's a big IF the shorts make it through next week, through quadruple witching day, through the hearing on the 17th. Guess what? IT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER. You know why? Because of the new CFO. the new CFO, when hired, will do a share recall and count shares forcing the shorts to close their positions.</p>
<p>Would I like the have the squeeze happen sooner? Of fucking course I would. But ask yourself this, if you knew you were going to be a multi-millionaire as long you do not sell shares and keep buying as much as you can, <em>with money you can afford to lose,</em> how long are you willing to wait? Shit if I knew I was going to be a millionaire and all I had to do was buy and hold, shit I can do that shit all fucking day.</p>
<p>But what do I know, I'm a dumb ape.</p>
