    "selftext": "This is indicative of a number of things, but primarily that they are COMPLETELY FUCKED, and that THE SHORT SQUEEZE IS STILL PROBABLE.\n\nSo, where to start \u2013 first off, been lurking here for the last couple months, I FOMO\u2019d at the end of January along with a whole lot of other people, before watching the crash down to 38 where I took the opportunity to average down. This started off for me as \u201cfuck you\u201d to spite RobinHood and the Shorts after I watched a YOLO I had put into *American-fucking-Airlines* crash hard when they shut down our trading. I apologize in advance for what is probably going to be a lot of words.\n\nThis is certainly not financial advice, as I am the furthest thing possible from a sound financial advisor. My personal life is a fucking train wreck, I have plenty of vices I battle with, to include drinking constantly and eating crayons, and I suck at picking stocks. Before all this I was down tens of thousands in the market. Never heard about WSB or what was going on here until I saw some buddies mention it on social media. But I\u2019ve always been pretty good at math, and analysis of human behavior and the human condition.\n\nMy professional background is in the military, and I\u2019ve been to some very interesting places and gotten to do some very interesting things in my life. I\u2019m not in counterintelligence but the nature of my past positions has had me working with/around those folks for years, and I like to think I managed to learn some valuable lessons along the way. One of my main roles previously required me to constantly study and analyze **how certain adversaries think and fight**, and develop counter-tactics to beat them at their own game when/if a war kicks off. Not much more I can say on that subject. It is generally my nature to keep such things about myself to myself and those close to me, but I\u2019m hoping I can highlight some things to you retarded Apes, particularly the newest among us who recently FOMO\u2019d and are at highest risk of eventually paper-handing.\n\nLittle more about me, so you know this isn\u2019t just bullshit from some conspiracy theorist dude in his mom\u2019s basement \u2013 I have a Master\u2019s degree and two doctorates that pertain highly to human behavioral analysis. In my external postgraduate studies, I have specialized in a couple different areas \u2013 human sexuality and human history in particular. I firmly believe that if you want to understand human beings and what drives them, you should study those two subjects \u2013 psychology, sociology and the rest are more or less built on the foundations of those two areas. As a sex researcher, I have studied some of the worst types of predators on this planet \u2013 types with no regard for human life, who do unspeakable things \u2013 and how their minds work. My counterintel exposure always helped me to make better sense of it all. So I have learned a **WHOLE LOT** about predators and ***how they*** ***operate*** over the last decade.\n\nWhen I went all in on GeeEmEe, it was because I noticed **patterns of behavior** that the HFs have been exhibiting, which is typical of predator behavior seen in individuals known as Cluster B psychopaths.\n\n**WHAT IS A CLUSTER B PSYCHOPATH?**\n\nGlad you asked. Okay, don\u2019t want to get overly technical on you but the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) lists Cluster B\u2019s as such:**\n\n**Cluster B:**  A person with this type disorder has difficulties regulating their emotions and behavior. Others may consider their behavior dramatic, emotional, or erratic. There are four cluster B disorders: **antisocial**, **borderline**, **histrionic**, and **narcissistic** personality disorders. \n\nIndividuals can sometimes exhibit combined traits of two or more of these, but SOME of those Cluster B traits include:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **manipulative or deceitful behavior for personal gain****, such as lying or assuming false identities**\n* **repeated antisocial actions, such as harassment or theft**\n* **irresponsible actions****, which can affect occupational, social, and financial aspects of life**\n* **disregard for personal safety or the safety of others**\n* **using dramatic, theatrical expressions and emphasis when expressing emotion**\n* **a pattern of self-important or grandiose behavior, such as exaggerating achievements      and** **expecting to be recognized as superior**\n* **fantasies of unlimited success, power**\n* **a belief of importance, specialness, and uniqueness that only other high-status people can      understand**\n* **a need for excessive admiration**\n* **a sense of entitlement, such as unreasonable expectations of favorable treatment**\n* **a tendency to take advantage of others for personal gain**\n* **a lack of empathy**\n* **arrogant, condescending behaviors or attitudes**\n\nSound familiar??  Want the short (pun-intended) translation?  All this illegal, fucked up, manipulative, deceitful, rewriting-history bullshit that the hedgies are pulling??   **THAT IS HOW THEY THINK****.** **NATURALLY****.** **EVERY****.** **GODDAMN****.** **DAY****.**  This is all business as usual for them, only **THIS TIME,** *people who like the stock* of the Shorts\u2019 ***would-be victim (GeeEmEe)*** have managed to catch their **BALLS IN A VISE.**\n\nI\u2019ll say it louder for the people in the back \u2013 THE HEDGE FUNDS, PARTICULARLY **THE SHORTS**, **ARE PREDATORS**. That is who you are fighting.\n\n**AND LIKE ALL PREDATORS, THEY PREY ON THOSE WHO THEY** ***THINK*** **CAN\u2019T/WON\u2019T FIGHT BACK.**\n\nSo their behavior of targeting and destroying American companies, costing thousands of people their jobs, driving up homelessness and suicide rates, *is* their regular operating mode. They ***enjoy*** doing it. They experience **ELATION** from doing it, and the feeling of **POWER** that comes with that. They like to think that the whole world, and **all of us**, are they plaything. That\u2019s what they **get off** to \u2013 that they are \u201cabove\u201d the rules and the law, and *get away with it*. Let me remind you that Jeffrey Epstein was a Hedge Fund guy.\n\n*Disclaimer:* I am **NOT for a moment** saying that *every* person that works at a HF is evil and/or a predator, but that **it is an environment** where predators that ***do*** work there can naturally **THRIVE** and **RISE TO THE TOP**, because their natural traits \u2013 their cunning, ruthlessness, narcissism, disregard for human life/wellbeing of others, skill at deceit, backstabbing, lying, manipulation, etc \u2013 all give them a **distinct tactical advantage** in clawing their way to the **top** of those organizations. A not-insignificant percentage of corporate CEOs display the same behavioral traits. **Think of them as \u201cserial killers of finance\u201d**, only their psychopathic disorders have manifested themselves differently \u2013 instead of killing people (directly) they\u2019re killing companies and communities **for sport**.\n\nSo why do they continue to tangle? Why give a fuck about what a bunch of retarded Apes are doing? This is the good news for us, and their behavioral patterns have confirmed it for me. **WE \u2013** ***YOU*** **\u2013 HAVE THE HIGH GROUND, AND THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING EVERYTHING TO GET YOU TO MOVE OFF OF IT.** **THEY DO NOT HAVE THE POWER RIGHT NOW**, which to them is an **unfathomably uncomfortable and unfamiliar position** to be in.  Meaning, ***THEY HAVE NOT COVERED THEIR SHORT POSITIONS***, and their actions are all but certain confirmation of that, at least by my retarded analysis.\n\nFor the benefit of some of our newer Apes, a small taste of what we\u2019ve seen from the Shorts so far:\n\nA) \u201cOur short positions have been covered.\u201d // \u201cOur balls aren\u2019t ACTUALLY caught in a vise, why don\u2019t you run away before I club you over the head.\u201d (Instilling fear that you can still be hurt badly, to scare you away from a position where you have the power to hurt *them*.)\n\nB) \u201cLol you really are FUCKING RETARDS, the squeeze already happened!\u201d // \u201cYou idiot, this vise isn\u2019t even tightened down, I can pull my balls away *easily*, and then I\u2019ve got you!\u201d (Belittlement to destroy self-confidence by sowing doubt/uncertainty of the strength of your position.)\n\nC) \u201cWSB/Retail cornering the helpless HFs was a calculated predatory move.\u201d / \u201c*I\u2019M* not the predator, *YOU\u2019RE* the predator! / \u201cSlavery was a FAMILY business, I was never in it by choice! If-If anything, ***I\u2019M*** the victim here!\u201d // \u201cYou\u2019re hurting my balls in this vise, *how could you* ***do that*** to another *human being*?\u201d (Counteraccusation/Purported victimhood/Appealing to your decent human nature as a manipulation tactic to get your guard down, then brutally attacking you as soon as they\u2019re free/regain the upper hand.)\n\nSo \u2013 now we\u2019re down to one of the final, and **MOST DANGEROUS AND EFFECTIVE** tactics that they (Cluster B\u2019s) ***LOVE*** to use\u2026 \n\n**THE WEAPONIZATION OF EMPATHY.** ***YOUR*** **EMPATHY.**\n\nI have been genuinely touched by a lot of the stories and aspirations I have read by the people in this sub and over in WSB before it was compromised (now I\u2019m far more wary of things over there, and even here \u2013 CHECK poster histories!). You retarded Apes are genuinely good human beings. I have felt more hope for humanity reading through this sub in the last few weeks than I\u2019ve felt in a long time, and I say that as someone who has had their faith in humanity broken MANY, MANY times over. You really care about and want to help your families, friends, neighbors, communities, countries, planet, and each other. You have high ideals and aspirations for the good that you\u2019ll be able to do, and most importantly, **high empathy**. **THIS IS WHAT THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE NOW TARGETING**. First off, please know that your empathy **does not make you weak**, it makes you a **better person**. Better than the Shorts, **by a lot**. You should never let yourself become like them, so I\u2019m not saying you have to become coldly indifferent/try to block your own emotions. First off, that won\u2019t work, because you\u2019re wired with high empathy, as I said. Second, it\u2019s not necessary. All that is necessary is that you RECOGNIZE their tactics **as they are happening** so you can RESPOND APPROPRIATELY.\n\nIf you read the above examples, here\u2019s a new one: \u201cPlease, I have kids who will be affected when you take all of our money, this will hurt them!\u201d // \u201cI wasn\u2019t sneaking into your house to hurt you, I was just trying to provide for my beloved family!\u201d Just like the utter BULLSHIT pleading we saw posted the other day in the now-deleted link titled \u201cPLEASE STOP. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS WRONG.\u201d\n\nIn that post, \u201cCityLady1\u201d (seriously?) is trying to pull at your heartstrings and the whole \u201cTHINK OF THE CHILDREN\u201d crock of shit she spins is a prime example. When psychopaths want to manipulate you, one of the FIRST things they will always pull out as a technique is to trigger our INNATE instinct to protect the young of our society. Think about your response when you hear a baby or child suddenly crying in fear or pain (assuming you yourself are not a psychopath) \u2013 you feel a STRONG pull to rush to help, and quickly look up or move in the direction of the sound. As humans, this is BUILT INTO OUR DNA, and elicits one of our **most powerful emotional responses**. They are trying to trigger that in you. We saw this with the whole \u201cSave Our Children\u201d campaign that was actually tricking a lot of people into spreading misinformation and Q Anon crap all over social media last year. It has been employed as a weapon by our adversaries to undermine public faith in our (U.S.A.\u2019s) electoral system and overall system of governance, so that we are weakened within from infighting. We\u2019ve seen those types of attacks on democratic republics around the globe. Now, the Shorts are trying to use it to weaken all of us Apes from within.\n\n**\u201cLove bombing\u201d** is another tactic that uses your own empathy against you. Exploiting the endorphins you feel from **doing good things**, and also from positive connections and bonding. Predators, *particularly* Cluster B\u2019s, will abuse victims *for years* \u2013 usually somebody physically, mentally, or emotionally vulnerable \u2013 causing incalculable damage and pain, both physical and psychological. When the victim is FINALLY able to fight back/call them out on their bullshit, the predator will *suddenly act* really sweetly and lovingly toward them, remind them of the \u201cgood experiences\u201d from earlier in the relationship, etc, which is designed to confuse the victim, trigger endorphins, and pull them back into a cycle of abuse. This is an easy trap to fall for because as humans, **we innately need and seek connection** (which is also probably one of the reasons we all feel so drawn to this sub). My point here \u2013 I think that everybody wanting to help/sponsor animals, contribute to causes is great \u2013 again, it\u2019s indicative of how much you care. However, I think there is a STRONG probability that the Shorts are using this sudden \u201csaving animals\u201d campaign to *seed the concept* of people exiting their positions earlier than they should. I mean, *\u201cTHINK OF ALL THE GOOD YOU COULD DO, WITH THE MONEY YOU\u2019VE ALREADY MADE!\u201d, and the accompanying* ***fear of potentially losing that ability to help****.* **The regular urgency we feel to help those around us who need it is what is being manipulated right now**. Thankfully I\u2019ve seen most posts for adoptions etc as being 50 bucks here or there (not really a big deal IMO) but they will attempt to distract us and siphon off as much strength as they can to delay the Short Squeeze. Point is, they\u2019re targeting our own goodwill toward one another here in the sub(s) in order to divide us, getting Apes to fight Apes over who\u2019s right, after they very likely CREATED or **at the very least SEIZED UPON** this situation to do so. That is what predators do. They weaponize and exploit people\u2019s *best* human traits against them.\n\nThe fact that they are using all of these tactics is nothing new to them, not in the stock market, not in life. But the sheer VOLUME of it all, measured against the media blackouts, blatant market manipulation, and other general tom-fuckery shows an increasing pattern of desperation and aggressiveness \u2013 there\u2019s been plenty of other DD already pointing that out.\n\n**TL;DR:** **Expect them to continue to** **fuck with your mind** and attempt to **weaponize your goodness and your empathy** against you.\n\n**Some Suggested Counter-Tactics:**\n\n**BUY AND HOLD, AND THEN BUY AND HOLD SOME MORE.** **THE NOOSE (OR VISE PER MY ABOVE EXAMPLE) IS TIGHTENING.**\n\n**DON\u2019T pin your hopes on specific DATES**, because your endorphins associated with those high hopes will *crash* if/when they manipulate the stock so that it doesn\u2019t moon by those dates, and the negative chemicals/emotions you experience will work powerfully against you. The **MATH and DD of the Short Squeeze is solid** \u2013 there are plenty of Apes much smarter than me in that department whom have done fantastic DD (I feel like I\u2019ve learned huge amounts more about the market since being here). Remember that **our emotions are the wild card**, which is why they are targeting THEM, and **they are naturally good at it** \u2013 it\u2019s one of the last avenues they have since their traditional bag of stock manipulation tricks has been exposed and is falling flat. \n\n**DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANYBODY ASKING FOR IT ON THE SUBS**, for \u201cpetitions\u201d or what the fuck ever. This includes **just your name, and your position/pricing on GME**. If I was on their side of this fight I\u2019d be exploiting the SHIT out of data like that. You guys have heard of \u201cphishing\u201d I\u2019m sure, but \u201cspear-phishing\u201d is a lot more dangerous, and allows them to isolate and target you directly. By letting your identity slip you make it way easier for them, and every other bad actor on the internet.\n\nTake breaks. Plenty of people have already said this. **PATIENCE AND** **HOLDING** **IS KEY.** **EVEN IF IT TAKES WEEKS/MONTHS.** **YOU HAVE THEIR BALLS IN A VISE.** **NOT JUST THEM BUT THE CORRUPTION OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.** **DON\u2019T. LET. THEM. GO****.** ***The Shorts are bleeding out.***\n\nLastly, remember the emotional tactics are being used **in concert with** all of their other, more mathematical, more definitively illegal methods, in order to \u201cconfirm\u201d negative emotional reactions with \u201cevidence\u201d at the planned time. **DO NOT FALL FOR IT**. Stay retarded you fucking wonderful Apes.\n\nP.S. If you\u2019re a shill / manipulator / Hedge Fund Cluster B, fuck right off and don\u2019t even bother DMing me. If you read my post and the *small* portion I shared about my professional and academic background, you should already know that I will see you coming a mile away because **hunting fuckers like you is my job**. **You don\u2019t wanna come-a-knockin\u2019.**",
