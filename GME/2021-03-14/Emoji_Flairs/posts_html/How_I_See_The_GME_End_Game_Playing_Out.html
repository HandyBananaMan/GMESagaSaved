<p>This post contains total speculation about how I THINK this GME end game will play out.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, I have a lot to say.</p>
<p>FULL DISCLAIMER: I am just some guy who has read tons of all the wonderful due diligence posted on r/GME and r/WallStreetBets over the past three months, especially by the likes of u/rensole and u/HeyItsPixel (if you either of you two want to look over what follows and poke holes or offer insight, I’d much appreciate it). All this reading has added some very fine wrinkles in my brain and I’d like to share with you all how I think this is going to play out over the coming weeks (yes I said WEEKS). This is just my opinion and in no way is any financial advice. Do your own research. If you have questions, counter theories, holes in my logic, please add it to the comments. I will try to address it.</p>
<p>First things first, I don’t want to be called a shill. I am a real person who’s mostly been lurking on this sub but I’ve begun to speak up a little more and more.</p>
<p>To hopefully prove to you I’m not a shill this is me:</p>

<p>Why remove my anonymity? I have some speculation later in this post that MAY appear to some to be fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD). I still want to say these things. I don’t want these things to be dismissed out of hand because I think it offers value so I want to say it. I also don’t want to be called a shill because I am not. Maybe doing this will garner a little trust for me on your part.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in and out of the financial industry for the last 13 years (writing software). I worked for one of the largest clearing firms in Chicago from ’08 – ’12. I also just recently finished a contract (almost three full years) with a large pension fund manager at the end of January. And just for a little extra spice, I was interviewed by Citadel for an open contract position, for which thankfully, I did not get.</p>
<p>All this being said, I am in no way a financial expert and I’m not claiming to be one. I just have been on the inside and seen how the sausage is made. I have a few more wrinkles on the brain than your average ape which is why I want to share my thoughts with the rest of you, beautiful diamond-handed apes.</p>
<p>Before we start, I want to define the players so it is easier to refer to them within this post.</p>
<p>· Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) – think of this entity as the clearing firm for the clearing firms. When I worked for a clearing firm, we cleared all of our daily activity through the DTCC.</p>
<p>· Shorting Hedge Funds (SHFs) – these are the hedge funds that are trying to drive GameStop to bankruptcy so they can make a quick, tax-free buck, while causing an American business to fail while costing thousands of people their jobs. They are doing this by taking massive short positions in GameStop. These are Citadel, Melvin Capital, and I’m sure many, many others.</p>
<p>· Long Whales (LWs) – these are other hedge funds and institutions that are bullish on GameStop and are taking long positions in the stock. These whales have huge deep pockets with lots of capital at their disposal. They are looking to make billions from this GME play and in the process bankrupt many of their key competitors in the process, namely Citadel.</p>
<p>· Retail Investors (RI) – any regular person with a brokerage account who wants to invest in GameStop on their own. This could be people with hundreds of dollars to some who have millions, maybe more.</p>
<p>· Redditors – a subset of the retail investor group that are providing valuable research, due diligence, and humor during this saga. I love all of you diamond-handed apes.</p>
<p>So, Friday went down pretty much how I thought it would.</p>
<p>Please read my Friday post, I don’t think it was read by enough of you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3egk7/be_patient_and_trust_the_process/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3egk7/be_patient_and_trust_the_process/</a></p>
<p>I said it would be likely that Friday would have GME finish flat or down for the day. Now up 6% on the day is hardly flat but the overall sentiment of the post still stands. The LWs wanted as many of the out-of-money call options being held by the SHFs to be worthless by the end of the day (reasons explained in the linked post).</p>
<p>We now have the same situation again for this week. I believe the SHFs have lots of call options expiring this Friday in the price range from the current price all the way up to $800.</p>
<p>The SHFs and LWs are now playing a game of chicken. Who’s going to blink first? It doesn’t matter because the LWs and RIs can hold forever because it isn’t costing either of these groups anything. It’s costing the SHFs millions of dollars to continue kicking the can down the road. The SHFs bought tons of options contracts between $300 and $800 expiring both last Friday and this coming Friday. The LWs noticed and countered, “fine, I’ll make that play worthless.” The SHFs tanked the price last Wednesday, the LWs and RIs bought the dip and raised that price right back up to the opening price for the day.</p>
<p>It’s almost as if the LWs are saying to the SHFs for every attack you have, we have a counter-measure. Your demise will be at a time and place of our choosing, quit f-ing around and take your lumps.</p>
<p>I wish I could find that brilliant post from last Friday that I read about how the Thursday closing price was significant because it allowed the for the trading of options expiring the next day. This was a huge light bulb moment for me and I’ll explain its significance in a bit.</p>
<p>So, this is how I see the end game playing out.  This is what I would do if I was the LWs.</p>
<p>I would try and keep GME under $400 for the week ($300 if they can pull it off but with the stimmy money coming that may not be possible). This again makes the SHFs many, many call options worthless, costs them millions of dollars in lost premiums, millions of dollars in short interest to continue to hold short, and ultimately denies them access to the precious shares.</p>
<p>Why not just pop this thing off this coming week and get it over with? Because those LWs want all of dat toothpaste (seriously, go read my post from Friday if you haven’t) and because two significant developments happen the week after.</p>
<p>The first significant development is the new DTCC rules go into effect for the following week. All the entities that use the DTCC are also responsible for its solvency. If you’re a LW, and you kick off the mother-of-all-squeezes (MOASS) BEFORE those rules go into effect, well you are kind of shooting yourself in the foot. Why do that? Just wait a week, bleed the SHFs some more, get all of that toothpaste.</p>
<p>The second significant development is that GameStop is having its Q4 earnings call after EOD Tuesday, March 23. I fully expect this earnings report to be bananas great for GameStop way exceeding the expectations. GameStop shed/closed many poor performing locations, they are reorganizing the leadership, they are pivoting the business. These are all the reasons why I think GameStop is a good buy despite any squeeze. Throw on top the fact that the next generation consoles dropped for both Xbox and Playstation in Q4 and most everyone got a $600 stimulus check in that same time frame. If you were fortunate enough to keep your job through the pandemic and also went to full-time remote, in most likelihood your expense dropped significantly to just the essentials, rent, food, utilities, etc. but your income stayed the same. Plenty of discretionary cash just sitting in bank accounts. All these people were also stuck at home with not much to do, why not buy one of the next gen consoles and play some video games. I’m a PC gamer myself, but I too played lots of games during the pandemic.</p>
<p>I think the earnings call will be really positive and GME will pop big time on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Why is waiting for after the earnings call good for the LWs? Plausible deniability (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability</a>). When all of this has played out, there is going to be A LOT of finger pointing and claims of market manipulation. Hell, this is already starting to happen. I think we can all agree that the SHFs have definitely been manipulating the stock price of GME. I also think though that the LWs have been manipulating it as well to play out their end game strategy how they want. If the LWs wait until after the earnings call and the stock’s subsequent ‘pop’, they can just say the earnings call was fantastic, that made everyone even more bullish on the stock. This is what caused the price to go up. It wasn’t us manipulating the market.</p>
<p>This ‘pop’ I feel will just be too much upward pressure on the stock and that the gamma squeeze will begin that Friday, March 26th with the MOASS happening the following week or the week after that.</p>
<p>This is how I think the LWs are going to kick off the gamma squeeze. A few paragraphs ago, I mentioned about being able to trade options contracts the day they are expiring. This is where it will come into play. I was watching the options chain on Friday for contracts expiring by the end of the day. As the day wears on, these out of the money (OTM) options become next to worthless. I saw $600 strike price call option contracts trading at $0.06 around noon (that’s right six cents). By the end of the day, anyone holding these contracts are practically trying to give them away. In fact, I held two call contracts expiring EOD Friday that sold off early in the day to try and recoup what I could. I took a significant loss on them but better to get something for a thing that is going to be worthless at the end of the day. I didn’t get back my full clip of ammunition but I got back a few of the bullets. I’ll be able to use these during the end game.</p>
<p>Now I think last Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday was the LWs ‘dry-run’ for how they are going to play this out. They knew at some point all those shorted shares the SHFs were borrowing were going to drop at once. The SHFs made this play on Wednesday and the LWs and RI countered.</p>
<p>The SSR was very obviously tripped on purpose early Thursday putting it into effect for the rest of Thursday and all of Friday. While I feel the SSR is significant, it isn’t necessary to pull this off, it just makes it easier to do so. I’ve read a bunch of DD on the SSR and its significance and it appears that the stock can still be manipulated and shorted even with the SSR in effect. Like I said, it just makes it tougher to do so with the SSR in force.</p>
<p>The key trying to get the GME to close on Thursday which allows for the trading of expiring option contracts the next day. If we see this again (my guess would be March 25th), my ears are definitely going to perk up and the hair on my neck will be at full attention.</p>
<p>So, with the SSR in place and the ability to trade same day expiring contracts, the stage will be set for the gamma squeeze. With the SSR in place, the SHFs will have a difficult time executing one last ditch effort at tanking the stock like they did last Wednesday. With the ability to same day trade expiring contracts, the LWs will start buy all of these up on the cheap because those holding the contracts don’t want to be bag holders. They will now hold thousands of seemingly worthless OTM contracts. But these contracts are soon not going to be worthless. They’re going to be worth diamonds. They will have access a shit-ton of actual shares for next to nothing. The LWs will then just start buying and buying. I’d expect volume to go just crazy right here. The stock price will rise causing more and more of their ‘worthless’ contracts to be in the money (ITM). This causes the option holder to cough up the shares and if they were ‘naked‘ options, they now have to buy them at the current price, increasing demand, increasing the price, vicious feedback loop. BOOM GAMMA SQUEEZE.</p>
<p>This gamma squeeze then kicks off the MOASS for the following week (or the week after). This part I’m not a definitive on because I don’t know how much upward pressure it’s going to take to trip the MOASS. It really doesn’t matter though because it’s going to happen.</p>
<p>Now for what I see as two potential monkey wrenches (maybe we call them ape wrenches) that could alter this endgame.</p>
<p>First, the stimmy checks. You diamond-handed apes are going to be handed fresh bananas. I’m sure many of you are going to use those bananas to buy more GME stock. I say good for you, you beautiful smooth-brained ape. Trade bananas for stock, sell stock to get many, many tendies. I like that trade. I just honestly don’t know what kind of upward pressure this is going to put on the GME stock. It may cause it to ‘pop’ too soon. Either way, it’s not a necessarily a bad thing to ‘pop’ early, it’s just not ideal. I think it is better for everyone who will still be standing (including the DTCC and our government) if this happens after March 19th.</p>
<p>Second ape wrench being how much these shares are going to be worth. This is the part where some may accuse me of spreading FUD. That is not my intention but I want you to be aware of this because it’s a real possibility. We’re going to get paid, of that I’m certain. It’s just going to be a question of how much.</p>
<p>If the SHFs refuse to cover their shorts, their brokerage (if using one) will liquidate their other positions to raise capital to begin covering their short positions. The brokerage will do this when the margin calls for holding those positions becomes untenable (the week after the gamma squeeze). If the brokerage cannot liquidate enough to cover, then the clearing firm they use will do the same thing to them, liquidating the brokerage’s other positions to close out the shorts. This is what will happen to the market makers (MMs) shorting as well. Their clearing firm (CF) will liquidate their other positions to cover their shorts. If the clearing firms, cannot completely cover all of the shorts with the liquidated positions, then the DTCC will do the same thing to the clearing firms that cannot cover. The DTCC has very, very deep pockets and a crazy insurance policy for this sort of thing. However, if the DTCC cannot cover all of the shorts, I guess it will once again fall to the American people to cover for Wall Street’s risky behavior. It’s going to be a shit show for sure.</p>
<p>So, what are these shares going to be worth? Theoretically, these shares will have infinite value. The SHFs (and by extension the MMs, CFs, and DTCC) HAVE TO BUY them from the LWs and the RIs. By some estimates I’ve seen about how much of the float is being shorted, the SHFs will HAVE TO BUY these shares multiple times. I’m convinced that AT LEAST 200% of the float has been shorted. I’ve seen estimates that it could be as high as 900%. WE JUST DO NOT KNOW. Think about that, the SHFs will have to buy the entire float not once but twice at a price set by the LWs and RIs.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting. You apes have been so conditioned to HODL for these past three months (many of you even longer). The less supply of shares (because everyone’s still holding) the more worth the limited shares available becomes. If the prices (and I do mean IF, a big f-ing IF), gets too ‘crazy’ the government MAY have to step in and sort all of this out. They MAY have to say every share is worth $X dollars and then we get paid based on this arbitrary figure. For me personally, anything less than $2,000,000 a share would be a slap in the face. Yes, $2MM a share is my new floor.</p>
<p>What’s a ‘crazy’ price? I haven’t a clue. But I think there is a number out there where this event could get triggered.  Just something to ponder. I do really believe that it is in the best interest of the U.S. government to let the market play out and then just bail out if necessary. It would be really damaging to the markets if the government stepped in and said all shares are worth $X.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>I know predictions are looked down upon on this subreddit but I’m going to make of few because I believe them to be logical and well researched. In no way is any of this a certainty and if it doesn’t happen on the exact dates specified doesn’t mean it isn’t going to happen. The squeeze will happen. This is just my reading of the tea leaves.</p>
<p>I believe GME will trade mostly sideways this upcoming week. We’ll see red days and green days but I’d expect the price to stay below $400 through the week.</p>
<p>The week of 22nd will see the new DTCC rules go into effect and GME has its earnings call. This earnings call will cause a ‘pop’ in the price creating upward pressure for the end of that week. The long whales will attempt to trigger the gamma squeeze on the 26th.</p>
<p>MOASS occurs either the week of the 29th or the week after.</p>
<p>Just HODL you filthy apes.</p>

<p>BEGIN SOAPBOX RANT</p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far please indulge me while I get on my soapbox and speak to the bigger implications of what’s about to occur.</p>
<p>I am going to be speaking strictly from an American perspective because it is what I’m immersed within and what I know the most. For any non-Americans, what I’m about to say may be applicable to what’s going on in your country as well. So, when I use terms like society going forward, I’m specifically speaking about it from the American perspective but it definitely is applicable to the whole world.</p>
<p>What is going down with GME isn’t much different with what happened in 2008.</p>
<p>Why does this ‘shit’ keep happening again, and again, and again, and again.</p>
<p>Accountability. Such a simple word. For far too long we as a society have not been holding those in power accountable for their immoral, unethical, and criminal behavior. Whether it is the corrupt politician, the crooked business man, or the police that oppress and murder our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>When we don’t hold the bad actors in our society accountable, it only emboldens them to do worse the next time. The thought being, “Well, I got away with it that time, what more can I get away with.” But in fact, we’re even worse than apathy toward holding the bad actors accountable. We reward them. We continually elect and reelect corrupt politicians, we give tax payer money to crooked businessmen who then pay themselves fat bonuses, we shield bad police from prosecution while awarding them with fat pensions.</p>
<p>One person, ONE PERSON, went to jail over the 2008 meltdown. Wall Street took exceptionally risky bets out of pure greed, those bets were bad bets and failed bets but we were all left holding their bag. Not only did none of them go to jail, some of them became even more wealthy.</p>
<p>I don’t care if you’re on the right side of the political spectrum or on the left side. Take a long hard look at our society and take a good long look in the mirror. If you’re honest with yourself, truly, brutally honest, you know what I am saying is correct. The ‘system’ is broken. It has been for probably 40 years. One of the biggest reasons it is broken is because no one is held accountable for their bad deeds.</p>
<p>The people that caused this mess need to be held accountable. They need to be criminally prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for the fraud they’ve committed. Failure to do so will only result in another ‘crises’ like this happening again.</p>
<p>I am hopeful, ever so hopeful that some real change will come out of these events when it has all finally transpired. I want to live in a different society, one not run by greed and profit, but one ruled by compassion and love. There is enough abundance in this world for everyone to share and prosper. What type of world would you rather inhabit?</p>

<p>Edit: changed the flair per request.</p>
<p>Clearly delineated where the TL;DR ends and where my rant begins.  There seems to have been confusion in the comments.  The rant isn't part of the TL;DR.</p>
