<p>Found something interesting- donâ€™t know if it means anything but here are some articles connecting the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund with Bill Gates. Next article ties Bill Gates to Citadel CEO Ken Griffin. </p>
<p>Might be nothing, but it makes you go hmmmðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss and get the word out- share in WSB or any other subs who are pushing the ape adoption through this foundation. Many other ape foundations exist to donate to - need to research and see who is involved with the foundations before spending money - just my opinion and not financial advice bc I donâ€™t know shit </p>

<p>Edit: getting downvotes for my comments suggesting that itâ€™s wise to fully research a charity foundation before donating and promoting that foundation</p>
