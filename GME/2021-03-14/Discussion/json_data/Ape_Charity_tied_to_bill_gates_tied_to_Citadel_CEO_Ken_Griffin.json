    "selftext": "Found something interesting- don\u2019t know if it means anything but here are some articles connecting the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund with Bill Gates. Next article ties Bill Gates to Citadel CEO Ken Griffin. \n\nMight be nothing, but it makes you go hmmm\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n \n\nFeel free to discuss and get the word out- share in WSB or any other subs who are pushing the ape adoption through this foundation. Many other ape foundations exist to donate to - need to research and see who is involved with the foundations before spending money - just my opinion and not financial advice bc I don\u2019t know shit \n\n\nArticles:\n\nBill gates and dian Fossey gorilla fund connection:\n\nhttps://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2000/04/Dian-Fossey-Gorilla-Fund\n\n\nBill gates and citadel connection: \n\nhttps://www.citadel.com/news/ken-griffin-and-the-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-scale-tutoring-program-to-address-persistent-opportunity-gaps-in-major-urban-districts/\n\n\nEdit: getting downvotes for my comments suggesting that it\u2019s wise to fully research a charity foundation before donating and promoting that foundation",
