DFV was bullish on GME way longer than you new cucks have thought about paper handing your shares. Sack the fuck up.  Not financial advise, not a cat.

Edit 1: I’ve always thought of myself as a logical person, never big on gambling unless the odds were stacked in my favor.. reminder: Sir this is a casino, but who gives a rat’s about a paycheck or a stimmy that’ll take you a month or two to recover from losing when the odds are in your favor and you’ll acquire a lifetimes worth of gains. A couple grand I can live without, but being that cuck retelling the same old “I’d be rich if i held gme” story - piss off...
