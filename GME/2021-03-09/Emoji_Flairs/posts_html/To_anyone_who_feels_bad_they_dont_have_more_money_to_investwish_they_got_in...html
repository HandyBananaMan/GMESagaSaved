<p>I know I wish I’d gotten in at $2 instead of $80. But think of the millions of people who have no idea what’s going on. The media is making a concerted effort to keep them in the dark or is flat out lying that this is over. Imagine how shit they’ll feel when this does moon. We are the lucky ones. Not financial advice, just like the stock.</p>
