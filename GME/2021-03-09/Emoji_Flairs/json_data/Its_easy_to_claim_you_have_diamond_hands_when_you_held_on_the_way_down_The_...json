    "selftext": "I get a feeling a lot of people aren't gonna hold as this thing moons and goes through dips on the way. And I feel this way because a lot of people getting in are on WSB or watching the Youtubers who blew up because of all this.\n\nI checked WSB for the first time in a long time this morning. Pretty much the first time since joining this sub. And everywhere I see people fighting about the \"realistic\" price only being 1500. And that we have \"idiotic expectations\" of over 60k. The problem is that sub is huuuuge compared to this one. So all those people are hearing FUD and not getting the proper information.\n\nAlso, I've been watching the Youtubers who got big from this every morning. I stopped maybe last week because they don't have the info right either. They're typically more for AMC than GME because \"the percentage gains are bigger\" which isn't really true. But they believe it and they tell it to all their viewers. Don't get me wrong, I love AMC as well but it's no where near the monster that GME is. But the YT people are using that platform and bringing support away from GME to AMC. I even saw one YTer run a poll this morning over which one will moon more. Last I checked, the votes for AMC were crushing GME\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA little while back, this sub figured the real catalyst was gonna be public knowledge. And I still believe that. But people aren't getting the right information which sucks cause it can all be found on this sub! The DD on here would definitely help people see the truth about GME\n\nIf I could become a Youtuber, I would but I don't have the skills for that. I'm trying to spread the information as best as I can but we really need the bigger platforms to get it right\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the bigger Youtubers claims he \"has diamond hands and will hold if it goes to 0.\" Easy to say and I would too cause that's the only way I'm taking a loss. But I know for damn sure he's gonna sell on the way up to lock in profits and his audience might follow when he does; screwing us all over. The only true \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc I know are here with me in this sub\n\nThis can definitely go to 100k, 500k and beyond. That\u2019s my target",
