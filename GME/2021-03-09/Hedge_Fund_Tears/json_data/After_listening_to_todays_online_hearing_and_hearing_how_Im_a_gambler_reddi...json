I buy more. I hold stronger.\n\nIts staying in my hands AT LEAST until 1.2m FLOOR for me (today). If the PROFESSIONAL gamblers are losing money and the retail (less than 20%) of the market is winning... well you're not the professional investors I need. \n\nI'm investing into myself, my future and the GLOBAL future and family. I'm not a fan of unlimited downside but ill take a BET of unlimited upside ANY DAY! Try working 6 or 7 days a week for 12 hours a day. This \"bet\" is NOTHING. Holding for me is EASY!\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8dThe Gamestops here boys and girls. Not a fixed price for me.
