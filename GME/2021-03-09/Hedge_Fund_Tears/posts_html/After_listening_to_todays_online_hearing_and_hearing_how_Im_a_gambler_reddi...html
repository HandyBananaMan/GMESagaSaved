<h1>Title: After listening to today's online hearing and hearing how I'm a "gambler", "reddit is ruining the market", "poor hedgefund shorters", "retail shouldnt buy single stocks they should invest into mutual funds so PROFESSIONALS can play with our money" I'm raising my previous floor from 510k to 1.2 MIL</h1>

<p>Its fine I don't need SEC or anyone's support or "help" </p>
<p>Say as you want as your phone rings off silent the whole meeting so you know what to say on the next scripted question. "Give my regards to your puppet master". </p>
<p>Me and my stock I own gonna sit here awhile.</p>
<p>You tried to illegally bankrupt a store i grew up with by bending rules and I took that personally. </p>
<p>Be mad. I buy more. I hold stronger.</p>
<p>Its staying in my hands AT LEAST until 1.2m FLOOR for me (today). If the PROFESSIONAL gamblers are losing money and the retail (less than 20%) of the market is winning... well you're not the professional investors I need. </p>
<p>I'm investing into myself, my future and the GLOBAL future and family. I'm not a fan of unlimited downside but ill take a BET of unlimited upside ANY DAY! Try working 6 or 7 days a week for 12 hours a day. This "bet" is NOTHING. Holding for me is EASY!</p>
<p>🚀 🦍🦍The Gamestops here boys and girls. Not a fixed price for me. The more fear I see the more I hold, the more I buy🦍🦍🚀 </p>
<p>I'm a damn 
🦍 with 🖍🖍 not anyone's financial advisor</p>
<p>🌙 or BUST. I don't get off before I hit moon ground!</p>
