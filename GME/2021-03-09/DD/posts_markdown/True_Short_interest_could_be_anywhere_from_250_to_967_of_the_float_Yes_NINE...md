So my colleague, who has no reddit account and wishes to be anonymous has been doing some maths (or math for you americans) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume & trading volume. The base behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...

Here's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r fuk!<

So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume.

At first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...

So then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.

So from the FINRA report I got:

* Short Volume
* Short Exempt Volume
* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)

From Yahoo Historical Data I got:

* Total Trade Volume
* Day's Closing
* Day's low

Then I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)

* Long Volume (ExV - SV)
* SV% (TSV / EV)
* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)
* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)

&#x200B;

I realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.

So I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \* $40).

If they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \* LV).

Then came to the conclusion of the data:

I wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:

* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.
* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.
* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.

IN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.

The **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**

It is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.

I believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.

Because you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.

My point for my want is this: **It is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons

NOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.

Thank you for coming to his TED talk.
