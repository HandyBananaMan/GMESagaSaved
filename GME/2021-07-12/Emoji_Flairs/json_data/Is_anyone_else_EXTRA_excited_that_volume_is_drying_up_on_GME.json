    "selftext": "Recently I\u2019ve noticed that the volume on GME barely cracks 2.5-3mil. Today it was only 1.6mil on a stock with a 72mil float. I\u2019ll say that again 1.6mil traded out of a 72mil float. This means more and more apes are buying and HODLing, which means less shares are in circulation, which means that if anyone has to cover their short or deliver shares for options contracts, they have a very limited pool from which to do so since we\u2019re going to be charging $136k+ for them to use our shares. Any good news or tiny uptick in demand will send this thing flying and cause a massive squeeze/spike in price. Anyone care to counter this logic? Or would you rather respond with \u201c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc MOON TOMORROW\u201d?\nI prefer the latter.\n\nEdit: changed target price for what we would charge since some people apparently downvote when they see $100k",
