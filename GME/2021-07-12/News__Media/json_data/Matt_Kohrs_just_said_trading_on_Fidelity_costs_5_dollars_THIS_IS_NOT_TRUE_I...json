Keep up the good fight brother!\n\nMatt, I hope you use this as learning opportunity for the community. As a way promote healthy discourse and understanding instead of negativity and misinformation. To show that we can be civilized on our path to truth. \ud83d\ude80 \n\nTransfer=No Dark Pools.\nDo what you will with this information.\n\n*For Robin Da\u2019 Hood transfer* -\n\nFractional shares/crypto will liquidate to cash (if you do a full transfer and not a partial one) Unsettled orders may delay the process.\n*be sure to have 75 physical dollars in either account for transfer fee (preferably Fidelity),*\n*took me 3-4 days, could take longer, \nNot a financial advisor, not financial advice, for educational purposes only, only do what\u2019s best for you and your money*\n\nFeel free to share onto other Apish Subreddits/posts/social media accounts. \ud83e\udda7\n\n*Matts voice has been important for this movement, I believe his intentions are good.*",
