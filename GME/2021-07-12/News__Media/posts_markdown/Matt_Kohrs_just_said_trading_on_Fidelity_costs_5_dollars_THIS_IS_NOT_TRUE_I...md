# Title: Matt Kohrs just said trading on Fidelity costs 5 dollars. THIS IS NOT TRUE. ITS FREE. Switching to a broker like FIDELITY forces PFOF brokers to buy your physical shares.

*Matt corrected himself and clarified that Fidelityâ€™s free to his users, thank you!*
Also the pot shot saying Iâ€™m not an ape wasnâ€™t necessary, being an ape isnâ€™t like owning a Sams Club membership. Keep up the good fight brother!

Matt, I hope you use this as learning opportunity for the community. As a way promote healthy discourse and understanding instead of negativity and misinformation. To show that we can be civilized on our path to truth. ðŸš€ 

Transfer=No Dark Pools.
Do what you will with this information.

*For Robin Daâ€™ Hood transfer* -

Fractional shares/crypto will liquidate to cash (if you do a full transfer and not a partial one) Unsettled orders may delay the process.
*be sure to have 75 physical dollars in either account for transfer fee (preferably Fidelity),*
*took me 3-4 days, could take longer, 
Not a financial advisor, not financial advice, for educational purposes only, only do whatâ€™s best for you and your money*

*Matts voice has been important for this movement, I believe his intentions are good.*
