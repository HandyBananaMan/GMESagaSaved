Go higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT-\n\nLets wrap a quick concept of what BILLIONS of dollars mean. ONE billion dollars is this number 1,000,000,000\n\nStop thinking 25 million even dents that. Go harder, get more, make them hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am a crayon eating moron.",
