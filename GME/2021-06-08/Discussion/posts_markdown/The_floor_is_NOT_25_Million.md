I keep seeing it posted here, but please remember, they shorted 140% of the stock.

The price is whatever you want it to be, not 25 million.

You want 25 million after taxes, hold and wait.

You want 50 million after taxes, hold and wait.

They literally \*have\* to buy, stop thinking small, these guys deal in billions of dollars, take them for what they are worth and take your fair share.

I honestly feel like there is people on here saying 25 million just to get us to sell at that price so Citadel can survive somehow, screw that. Go higher.

EDIT-

Lets wrap a quick concept of what BILLIONS of dollars mean. ONE billion dollars is this number 1,000,000,000

Stop thinking 25 million even dents that. Go harder, get more, make them hurt.

This is not financial advice, I am a crayon eating moron.
