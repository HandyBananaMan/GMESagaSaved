Hello all!

Some of you may remember me from WSB, some of you may not. Either way, let's have a quick conversation on the title of this post, shall we?

I see this question pop up ALOT, and while some people give good answers, they don't give great answers. I'm here to explain why, and how, the SEC stepping in would destroy the world. Literally.

First, a metaphor:

Imagine you're on vacation in Vegas. You've hit a few casinos, played some games. You're walking into a new place, and suddenly the lights are going off, klaxons are buzzing, people are cheering. You look over, and you see it.

A man has just won the jackpot on a slot machine.

The numbers are flying upwards as it announces his win. One million, two million, five million. It just keeps flying upwards. He's crying, a crowd is forming, a woman in a tube top is begging him to impregnate her on the spot, and he honestly looks like he might.

As you watch, a few people even post up at other slot machines of the same make and model, prepared to win it all as well!

But... suddenly the pit boss walks over, and unplugs his machine, and then all the others just like it.

"Sorry folks, there was a mistake. The machines had an error, the jackpot wasn't won. Please move along."

Ask yourself...do you think a single person there that day will ***ever*** play on one of those slot machines ever again?

The stock market, in some ways, works in exactly the same way. You put money in, you pull a handle, and sometimes money pops out. Other times it's depression and a life long addiction to alcohol, but that's for a different thread.

You play this game, because you BELIEVE you can win at it. You've won some, you've lost some, but you have the belief that eventually you'll hit it big.

You and everyone else in the stock market.

If the pit boss walks in, and 'unplugs' the market, resetting it all, you will lose confidence. So will everyone else that knows anything at all about the situation. That includes people from all across the planet. You think index funds, market makers, companies that trade stocks, are dumb? Because they aren't. If the SEC fucks this, there goes the confidence.

This would lead to a market crash of UNTOLD proportion. Not just a few stocks, but ALL stocks. And once they start showing red, the entire market would follow, because after the confidence is gone, all that is left is a decision between profit, and loss.

This is not conjecture, this is cold hard facts. Without confidence in the markets, the markets simply can not exist. No one plays a game they know is rigged against them, they play the games that *could* be rigged against them.

The SEC knows this, and so do you.

The SEC will NOT step in and fix this for the Hedge funds. They will not. The entire world is watching right now, and they would gladly sacrifice the hedge funds that made this mess, against the entire US economy.
