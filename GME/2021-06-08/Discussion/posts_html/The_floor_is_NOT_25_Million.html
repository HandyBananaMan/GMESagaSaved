<p>I keep seeing it posted here, but please remember, they shorted 140% of the stock.</p>
<p>The price is whatever you want it to be, not 25 million.</p>
<p>You want 25 million after taxes, hold and wait.</p>
<p>You want 50 million after taxes, hold and wait.</p>
<p>They literally *have* to buy, stop thinking small, these guys deal in billions of dollars, take them for what they are worth and take your fair share.</p>

<p>I honestly feel like there is people on here saying 25 million just to get us to sell at that price so Citadel can survive somehow, screw that. Go higher.</p>

<p>EDIT-</p>
<p>Lets wrap a quick concept of what BILLIONS of dollars mean. ONE billion dollars is this number 1,000,000,000</p>
<p>Stop thinking 25 million even dents that. Go harder, get more, make them hurt.</p>

<p>This is not financial advice, I am a crayon eating moron.</p>
