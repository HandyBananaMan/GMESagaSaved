<p>I'm mostly in the other sub, but you guys are the no 1 search result for "gamestop stock subreddit" and you need stickies to the most current DD RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>Why? The most recent Joe Rogan guest mentioned GME like 10 times and said "it's not over".</p>
<p>If newcomers arrive here they won't know where to start. HELP THEM.</p>
<p>I know you guys have a link in the navigation but the stuff in there is outdated!</p>
