I'm mostly in the other sub, but you guys are the no 1 search result for "gamestop stock subreddit" and you need stickies to the most current DD RIGHT NOW.

Why? The most recent Joe Rogan guest mentioned GME like 10 times and said "it's not over".

If newcomers arrive here they won't know where to start. HELP THEM.

I know you guys have a link in the navigation but the stuff in there is outdated!
