<p>After seeing this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/offc1p/mods_you_guys_need_a_dd_sticky_right_now/">post</a>, I am creating this post to help clarify what's going on with the stock.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>The Biggest Things You Need to Know:</h1>
<p><strong>1) The shorts never closed their positions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) The stock is still shorted over 100%, but is being hidden through options, ETF's and failure-to-delivers (FTD's).</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) GameStop is no longer a brick-and-mortar company but an up-and-coming company with a bright future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) There will be a short squeeze where shorts start closing their positions and the price skyrockets beyond imagination.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> r/Superstonk <strong>is a GME-friendly sub. As a matter of fact they only discuss GME and GME-related stuff, just like</strong> r/GME.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now with all this being said, I am linking some things for further dive into GameStop stock.</p>
