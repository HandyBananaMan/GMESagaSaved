After seeing this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/offc1p/mods_you_guys_need_a_dd_sticky_right_now/), I am creating this post to help clarify what's going on with the stock.

&#x200B;

# The Biggest Things You Need to Know:

**1) The shorts never closed their positions.**

**2) The stock is still shorted over 100%, but is being hidden through options, ETF's and failure-to-delivers (FTD's).**

**3) GameStop is no longer a brick-and-mortar company but an up-and-coming company with a bright future.**

**4) There will be a short squeeze where shorts start closing their positions and the price skyrockets beyond imagination.**

**5)** r/Superstonk **is a GME-friendly sub. As a matter of fact they only discuss GME and GME-related stuff, just like** r/GME.

Now with all this being said, I am linking some things for further dive into GameStop stock.

These are some of the many Due Diligences that have been posted by reddit users.

I encourage you to dig around both r/GME and r/Superstonk to deeply understand what's going on if you're still reading.

Thanks.
