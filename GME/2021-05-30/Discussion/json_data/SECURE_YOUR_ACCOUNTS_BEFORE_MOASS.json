I would also advise everyone to change their password to a STRONG password related to NOTHING else. \n\nAlso I\u2019ve heard gmail is a lot more secure than yahoo and other email domains. It may be a good idea to change to gmail or do further research.\n\nEDIT 1: 2FA = multi-factor authentication\n\nEDIT 2: getting downvoted by shills already I see\n\nEDIT 3: (from the comments) Protonmail is very secure\n\nEDIT 4: it is important to secure you accounts because once you have a ton of money even your \u201cfriends and family\u201d will want it. Some may even go to the extremes behind your back to receive it, so just secure yourself in every way possible.\n\nEDIT 5: there is a lot of good information in the comments (don\u2019t just look at the top ones)\n\n\nThank you everyone for the karma!\n\nBUY. HODL. VOTE. SECURE.",
