<p>Every share you purchase off Robinhood is through margin, even if you dont have gold or margin turned on.</p>
<p>Robinhood instant is what allows you to get instant access to trading funds as you wait for your bank transfer to clear, this is a form of margin offered to you by robinhood. therefore, any shares purchased from an account who did not MANUALLY DOWNGRADE to a robinhood cash account can be used to sell back to short sellers behind your back, without even deducting it from your view.</p>
<p>People who have tried transferring their robinhood shares directly to another broker are being DENIED, because they signed up for a non margin account on the new broker, and robinhood initiates the transfer with YOUR shares being labeled as MARGIN shares, causing the transfer to a non margin account to fail!</p>
<p>I have seen numerous posts stating this on WSB, with many awards and upvotes, only find the entire thread deleted a few hours later! Sometimes the user is banned too. There is a clear disinformation campaign going on at WSB, being orchestrated by the moderators themselves and millions of newly reactivated old reddit accounts.</p>
<p>Please remember most of the quality gme dd was pre-2m users. Shilling is at an all time high. There are almost 9m users now. 2/3rds of all traffic there is new, and half of the new traffic seems inorganic itself. There would be no reason for this much effort to get people to jump off board if this thing was over, it would be in HF's best interest for you to continue to hold the bag if it was already over.</p>
<p>I feel this still has potential to reach well over its previous ath from january, but a lot of people who think they are helping by buying shares are actually helping the shorts, giving them free ammo to sell back and fourth to eachother. The squeeze has not been squoze yet. Its easy to get caught up on the fact it already did 10,000% increase and call that a squeeze. but the fact is the definition of a squeeze is when shorts are  forced to cover in a cascading fashion making the price exponentially rise. It did 4 dollars all the way to 480 just on the BUILD UP to the squeeze. it never started forcing shorts to cover in a cascading type situation thanks to the haults put in place that thursday.</p>
<p>Make sure your broker is not lending out your shares, if you have robinhood you MUST downgrade to a cash account to stop them from doing so. If EVERYBODY who uses robinhood did this, it would have a much greater impact in the direction this goes more than continuing to purchase shares.</p>

<p>How to downgrade your account to a "Robinhood Cash" account.:</p>
<p>the difference with this kind of account is you must wait until your bank deposit clears to trade. no more instant deposits or access to funds after a trade, you must wait upto 3 days after selling a share to be able to trade with those funds.</p>
<p>The only way to even have this option to downgrade is waiting 2-3 days after your last sell or bank deposit clears. Nothing can be pending on your account, then after 3 days you can convert according to RH. </p>
<p>To convert:</p>
<p>Hit the bottom right Profile Button</p>
<p>Hit the 3 lines in the top right corner </p>
<p>Go to Investing </p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom and hit Day trade settings</p>
<p>On the bottom you will find Turn off Instant Settlement</p>
<p>If you dont see this option make sure you have already turned off margin and downgraded from Gold. If the option is still not there you will have to contact customer service so they can do it manually. This should convert all your shares to full ownership to you, since they were directly purchased by you with your own money Robinhood can no longer use your shares to cover the shorts, but It might still be a good idea to contact customer service and confirm anyway its been done. . When the lend your shares out to shorts they will do this behind your back, and not even negate it from your account so you dont notice.</p>
<p>If enough people did this it might make a good dent in the shares they have available to lend out to cover the shorts</p>
