<p>I don't consider myself an unlucky guy. But I know with a calm certainty that if I fold on my fellow apes, I will be punished accordingly. Just as Job shouted into the whirlwind, I too would feel the empty void of eternity as I watched the numbers rise up 24 hours after acquiring my 30 pieces of silver. I will not sleep in the garden of gethsemane. I will not deny the stock when asked. When the rapture happens and I ride the rocket into the loving arms of Harambe, all the doubt will be worth it.</p>
