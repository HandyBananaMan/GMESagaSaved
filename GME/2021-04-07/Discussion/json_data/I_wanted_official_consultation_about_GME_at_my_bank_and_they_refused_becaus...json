    "selftext": "Short story-time for amusement reasons only:\n\nsome days ago, I went to my bank (Austria). I am the owner of quite a number of GME shares and my broker app is actually just the bank-intern bond trading app, where I need to pay transactional feed everytime I buy (what is sell?) GME shares. I informed myself about the reasoning of those transactional fees beforehand and found out that by paying them, I have the right of consultation by my bank about the shares they\u2018re trading/I\u2018m buying. \n\nSo, I went to the main national building of my bank, they were really friendly at the beginning, enthustiatically, I mentioned GME to them and that I wish for professional consultation about the financial details involved with that stock (I am not a financial guy, actually, I don\u2018t exactly know what\u2018s going on, it\u2018s all pretty crazy to me). \n\nSuddenly, their posture and mimick changed pretty suddenly. I was told, they are not allowed to consult about GME. To my question, why this was the case, they told me, because GME is \u201etoo irrelevant for the big stock market\u201c. They are \u201eaware of the past short squeeze, but one should no longer focus on GME\u201c. They acted as if GME was some \u201echildish financial playground\u201c that should be forgotten about. When I confronted them with the huge recent naked short attacks and if they could explain to me possible effects of them if they were not covered, they just repeated themselves how \u201eGME is not relevant, please focus on stocks like Apple or Amazon to be safe\u201c. \n\nI left the bank, buying more GME shares.\n\nEDIT: This very same post has just been deleted from r/wallstreetbets for no reason that I am aware of.",
