I wasn't sure if I should label this as DD or not, but I decided against it considering I'm not going to  going too deep into things. Shout-out to the Ape who first exposed the OTC darkpool, if anyone remembers their handle could you tag em.

Well before we begin, darkpools are off-the-grid trading platforms that are usually independently owned by big-money players. They were originally meant to be used for massive orders that could shake the market in some way ie. Someone buying 5 million shares of a company with a float of 50 million. There are a few other benefits, like best best price execution and the like, but that's not today's topic.

Because darkpools are independently owned, and lazily regulated, it's quite easy for them to be abused. Which brings us to today's topic: darkpool abuse by retail brokers.

&#x200B;

Back in March when the OTC DP was exposed; it confirmed what some Apes always suspected: **Citadel** and co were abusing DP's to hide the real numbers to keep GME's stockprice from rising.

The numbers from the bigshots were so insane that the smaller players were overlooked. I didn't â€” and wouldn't have â€” pay any attention to the smaller fish, that is until a certain Bulgarian boy â€” the  savior of the retail investor â€” showed up to swim.

That's right **Robinhood** is trading on the same DP as Citadel. Now I guess that's not too surprising considering Vlad and Ken's... "close" relationship. What I found to be truly surprising was the astonishing level of Vlad's DP abuse when compared with Ken. While KenKen has an average of roughly 50 shares to every trade â€” Which is an already disgusting level of DP abuse â€” vlad has damn near a perfect 1 to 1 ratio. Based on what's already known about stock price manipulation using darkpools, and considering that most small-time GME traders on robinhood buy 1 share at a time â€” it's safe to assume that some point in February everytime someone purchased a GME share on robinhood it was likely acquired from the darkpool. Actually, I can't say for sure if every retail share was obtained from darkpools, but the numbers are worrying.

&#x200B;

While that's certainly enraging for some on its own, it's not like it's completely unexpected. But Robinhood's numbers made me curious, so I took a look at some of the other small fish in the OTC DP with similar ratios and found something truly surprising(to me at least). A quick Google search revealed that National Financial Services â€” who's been in the pool since January â€” is actually owned by everyone's new favorite champion: Abigail(**Fidelity**). Some would argue that Abi is one of the largest shareholders, so of course she'd use darkpools. Some others would also point out that the numbers are much smaller than likes of kenKen or Vlad. However the number of shares compared to trades clearly implies these are retail numbers. And what makes it even more sus is this:

As someone of you may have noticed Fidelity didn't start trading on the OTC DP until January even though they've been the largest institution owner since December. I figured it was pretty fucking weird how often a fluff piece about Fidelity would pop-up and then less than 5 minutes later another post saying basically the same thing would follow. I just figured it was Fidelity trying to capitalize on Robinhood's failure, but now I'm not so sure that's the case. If Fidelity's doing the same thing as Robinhood â€” isn't switching to them only creating a false sense of security?

&#x200B;

As I stated earlier the primary purpose of darkpools   is supposed the facilitation of large trades that would greatly upset the market. However, it's clear to see that  system is being grossly abused â€” especially obvious when comparing the traffic and ratios of the 2020 months â€” by not only MMs like Citadel, but also by retail brokers that are possibly partnered or subservient to them. Most of the low ratio numbers belong to retail brokers   
like **stockpile investments**  and **interactive brokers**  for example . And they also don't appear until Shorts entered panic mode.

&#x200B;

I'm curious to see how the numbers change and who else comes to swim in the March report.   
And although unlikely, I could be completely wrong, so feel free to poke holes in my theory. And again if anyone can tag the forgotten hero who orginally exposed the OTC darkpool I'd appreciate it. I would really like to hear his take on it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: multiple retail brokers like Fidelity and Robinhood are now confirmed to be trading on on the same darkpool as Citadel, so some of the shares you buy through them may not have an immediate effect on the price. And switching between robinhood and Fidelity might be a red herring.

ELA: KENKEN, VLAD AND ABI ARE HAVING FUN DP ACTION WHILE OTHER RETAIL BROKERS WATCH.
