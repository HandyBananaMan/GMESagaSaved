His account is a few days old as well.\n\nI have a very odd feeling about all the \"when GME hits X $ i am going to do this and that in the near future\" posts. A lot of these Accounts are just a few days old and always give very specific values to what their pricegoals within the next weeks are. It's just a feeling, maybe some of you feel the same?",
