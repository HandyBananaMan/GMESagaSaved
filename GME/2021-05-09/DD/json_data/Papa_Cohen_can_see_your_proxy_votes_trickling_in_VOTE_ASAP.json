    "selftext": "I was checking to see what capabilities that are available by the Proxy Voting vendor that Gamestop is using. The product is called [ProxyVote](https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/corporate-issuer/issuer/build-your-brand-and-engage-shareholders/proxyvote) by Broadridge Financial Solutions.\n\nAs a part of their product line they provide [Shareholder Data Services](https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/corporate-issuer/issuer/build-your-brand-and-engage-shareholders/shareholder-data-services) that integrates with ProxyVote.This provides data/analytics for companies to help drive towards participation results.\n\nAccording to their marketing material 70% of retail shares typically remain unvoted typically.  We can get a much higher percent of voted shares!  Vote your shares ASAP!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93clpkj7v3y61.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=457f2512d9853868f7a103c6b21153f17a05b5f3\n\n\\----------------------\n\nMajor Edit 1:\n\nSo, the rationale, means, and force behind this post is still 100% accurate.  The Gamestop board can see when your votes come in and effectively use this information near real-time.  However, the vendor that Gamestop is using (which I missed) is ComputerShare, which provides like-for-like services as ProxyVote.  I voted several times through ProxyVote, which is the service that Fidelity is using.  I have a feeling that each broker might have the choice of their proxy services.  According to the [Gamestop Corp 2021 - 14A Filing on 4/22/2021](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/#toc122967_28), Gamestop reimburses each broker for their costs if requested.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsn6xi85roy61.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6b3c8a54147b7e8ddad2de3214767ecef435c0",
