I was checking to see what capabilities that are available by the Proxy Voting vendor that Gamestop is using. The product is called [ProxyVote](https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/corporate-issuer/issuer/build-your-brand-and-engage-shareholders/proxyvote) by Broadridge Financial Solutions.

As a part of their product line they provide [Shareholder Data Services](https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/corporate-issuer/issuer/build-your-brand-and-engage-shareholders/shareholder-data-services) that integrates with ProxyVote.This provides data/analytics for companies to help drive towards participation results.

According to their marketing material 70% of retail shares typically remain unvoted typically.  We can get a much higher percent of voted shares!  Vote your shares ASAP!!!

Major Edit 1:

So, the rationale, means, and force behind this post is still 100% accurate.  The Gamestop board can see when your votes come in and effectively use this information near real-time.  However, the vendor that Gamestop is using (which I missed) is ComputerShare, which provides like-for-like services as ProxyVote.  I voted several times through ProxyVote, which is the service that Fidelity is using.  I have a feeling that each broker might have the choice of their proxy services.  According to the [Gamestop Corp 2021 - 14A Filing on 4/22/2021](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/#toc122967_28), Gamestop reimburses each broker for their costs if requested.
