<p>I was checking to see what capabilities that are available by the Proxy Voting vendor that Gamestop is using. The product is called <a href="https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/corporate-issuer/issuer/build-your-brand-and-engage-shareholders/proxyvote">ProxyVote</a> by Broadridge Financial Solutions.</p>
<p>As a part of their product line they provide <a href="https://www.broadridge.com/financial-services/corporate-issuer/issuer/build-your-brand-and-engage-shareholders/shareholder-data-services">Shareholder Data Services</a> that integrates with ProxyVote.This provides data/analytics for companies to help drive towards participation results.</p>
<p>According to their marketing material 70% of retail shares typically remain unvoted typically.  We can get a much higher percent of voted shares!  Vote your shares ASAP!!!</p>

<p>Major Edit 1:</p>
<p>So, the rationale, means, and force behind this post is still 100% accurate.  The Gamestop board can see when your votes come in and effectively use this information near real-time.  However, the vendor that Gamestop is using (which I missed) is ComputerShare, which provides like-for-like services as ProxyVote.  I voted several times through ProxyVote, which is the service that Fidelity is using.  I have a feeling that each broker might have the choice of their proxy services.  According to the <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-126940/#toc122967_28">Gamestop Corp 2021 - 14A Filing on 4/22/2021</a>, Gamestop reimburses each broker for their costs if requested.</p>
