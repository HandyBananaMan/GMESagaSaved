Hello my dear apes,

I have returned from the darkness to drop my two cents once again.

As I hold my precious GME with absolute ZEN peace of mind, the picture has now been fully painted.

The army is here, everyone is here, everyone is holding, and those that are paper handing affect the MOASS LITERALLY ZERO because it has been over shorted beyond belief.

First although with recent events it has been absolutely clear that things which obviously should have caused price spikes in GME (new CEO, CFO, gameplan, crypto etc)  are actually not affecting the stock when Dark Pools are a thing (Dont worry I'll get to why this isnt an issue for us later)... lets break down what I said in my first DD because it is absolutely relevant here:

"**THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THE PRICE IS ARTIFICIAL, AND THAT THE SHORTS WILL TRY TO GRADUALLY SHOW THE HOLDERS OF GME MORE AND MORE HIGHER PRICES IN THEIR OWN RANGE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD WITHOUT BEING ABSOLUTELY MARGIN CALLED TO DEATH.**

**THINK ABOUT THIS AS A NEGOTIATION BETWEEN US AND THE SHORTS...**

**The shorts keep coming to us offering different prices for our priceless diamonds,**

**Shorts in Jan 28: Aight guys we are offering you maximum of 460 dollars for a share of your GME... Oh look the price is going more down, more people are accepting our offer, haha you better sell yours too!**

**Shorts in Feb: Hahaha, I told you idiots to take the offer on 460 dollars, now look where we are, we dont negotiate with longs. Last chance to take whats on the table with 150 dollars a share. This company is valued at 15 dollars a share, 150 is a steal!**

**Shorts in later Feb: I told you, this is a dying company. 45 dollars a share better sell now hahahah. You should have listened!!!**

**Shorts in March after radio silence: Okay guys... well this is awkward... so maybe it didnt work out the first time, how about I come back to the table like in Jan, but because you didnt agree to my price I am only willing to go as high as 360 dollars a share! You better take it now or else I am not coming back I SWEAR!**

I wrote this 4 months ago, and it is EXACTLY what is still going on. I will bet you a lot of bananas that they literally will no longer tank the price anywhere near where they think mass buying pressure will again come in. The reason they have hovered it around the range they have for so long is because they have found it to be the sweet spot. The sweet spot of low buying pressure. And now they try follow it up with what looks like a slow bleed out. The most qualified HIGHLY PAID behavioural scientists are working with these guys to create the biggest psychological show designed in history... the price movements you see. The price movements are designed to give you hope of the MOASS, and to very slowly make you feel like it is not going to happen. Guess what, it is literally PRIMED TO HAPPEN. Do not fall for a number drowning in their Dark Pools... thats the oldest trick in their book.

Now we start looking at the sources:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-09/gamestop-says-sec-is-investigating-trading-of-its-shares](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-09/gamestop-says-sec-is-investigating-trading-of-its-shares)

Gamestop publicly states that its shares are being investigated by SEC. Remember there is a lot of very wealthy shareholders here that are having billions of dollars tampered with. Trust in the SEC. But nonetheless the most important takeaway from this source is that it literally publicly states from GAMESTOP's own official statement that their shares are being investigated by the SEC long after the apparent 'short squeeze' was said to be over in January... and then again March... yea good joke.

GME new CEO, new CFO, new directors, insane board additions, insane gameplan, zero debt, everything that is by laws of supply and demand meant to increase a stocks price... yet we keep dropping.

And now sync up the moments that these events happen, and how they affect the price of GME. This is why the SEC is investigating. This is why this is so blatantly obvious. This is how you know we are PRIMED for MOASS. This is how you can see that all we can do is IGNORE THE PRICE BECAUSE IT IS FAKE AND WAIT TILL THESE CRIMINALS STOP MANIPULATING IT. Worst part for these angry babies is, they are doing their dirtiest tactics they have used for decades in the dark, but this time the whole world is watching. There is literally no way they can win this and that is because of one thing: Holding is free, holding costs nothing, holding is the ultimate goal to ever winning at any stock in the stock market. AND I MEAN GENUINE LONG TERM INVESTMENT HOLDING LIKE 5-10 YEARS. The SEC is creeping up on them, the holders are going on with their lives and just holding, and their facade will eventually crumble. WHEN? NOBODY KNOWS. MAYBE NEXT FEW MONTHS, MAYBE NEXT FEW YEARS.. DO YOU NOT SEE WHAT IS GOING ON???? SIT AND JUST WAIT. ITS FUCKING FREE.

What is my strategy for ABSOLUTE ZEN DOMINATION PLAYING AGAINST CHEATERS:

I check up on my shares every now and then, but I am continuing my life on the side... Keep your motivations and ambitions going while our rocket is being primed, do not just sit and browse reddit all day or hope for the day of the MOASS. I personally find it great to keep working a job that gives me income, so I can keep investing a portion of that income on a monthly basis.

**These were some thoughts I wanted to share with a beloved community after I have been inactive for a while continuing with life, and enjoying it. I love how we are all at some point in The Big Short right now, we just don't quite know where. I am incredibly excited for being part of history... because when it happens, it happens in an instant, and those who sat on the rocket and never got off will be the only ones who don't miss it.**

I am not a financial advisor. DO NOT LISTEN TO ME IM JUST SAYING MY OPINIONS.
