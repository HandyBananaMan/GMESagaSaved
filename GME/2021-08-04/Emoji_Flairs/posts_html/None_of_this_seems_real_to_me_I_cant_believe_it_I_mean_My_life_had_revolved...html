<h1>Title: None of this seems real to me. I can‚Äôt believe it. I mean. My life had revolved and studied for a bullshit market. God, what a plot twist. But, my gut is 100% okay with this but I feel alone surrounded by a bunch of NPCs.</h1>

<p>Everywhere online says people like me are delusional. I‚Äôm told I need help. Buy real stocks. Or that Im listening to Q anon. But, I‚Äôm doing my own confirmation bias reading. I‚Äôve been here since the start for gods sakes.</p>
<p>Most of the public isn‚Äôt aware of the fuckery that keeps them going financially. What keeps their jobs. Their retirement. Their home. And no matter how much we scream, it falls on deaf ears and they just won‚Äôt listen. And nor do most of the public ever pay attention half the time anyways.</p>
<p>IM READING NEW APPROVED DD EVERY OTHER DAY FFS. There‚Äôs thousands of investors with GME who know a lot more about the market then some of us smooth brains do and that‚Äôs what helps me learn. THANK YOU. </p>
<p>But regardless of how much I‚Äôm on here, I feel super alone while I‚Äôm holding a lot of money in one stock. No matter how much I read the DD, I feel like the main character and just feel powerless sometimes. Sometimes I wonder, maybe I‚Äôm crazy?</p>
<p>But for some reason, I feel total.fucking.zen. I‚Äôm under thousands of dollars in the red and for the first time playing the stock market this is the only time where I don‚Äôt care. </p>
<p>The price isn‚Äôt real. Many times in the past I told myself stop being a little bitch and deleted the sell limit orders in the past after realizing holy fuck what am I doing. </p>
<p>RC, DFV, GameStop‚Äôs growth, the media, the threats, everything. It‚Äôs all confirmed. It all proves to me this is beyond a simple stock. And I know I‚Äôm missing hundreds of more reasons why. </p>
<p>I mean, literally my marketing professor jgave me a grade A on my project assignment about GameStop, the future growth, potential and value it has. And that was nonstop back to back 34 pages worth assignment that took 4 months to do. (All with my own words of course and citations) AND IT TOPPED EVERYONE ELSES ASSIGNMENT EVEN BOEING. </p>
<p>I wish I had a copy to show you guys, it was fun to make.</p>
<p>For fucks sakes, I have NEVER seen a stock chart look this fucky either. And it even resembles previous movements from the past.</p>
<p>I am fully dedicated to seeing the corruption end. I‚Äôm paying good fucking money to see Wallstreet get fucked. And the tickets are god damn worth it.</p>
<p>YOU GO GARY GENSLER, ROCK ON DFV, RC YOU DA MAN. GAME STOP WONT STOP.</p>
<p>Even if this takes a year, or years, I‚Äôll be holding.</p>
