<p>The truth is if I keep buying the supply when hedgies need to cover the demand will outweigh the supply thus sending is TO THE MOON 🌝 I hold to fight the corruption &amp; fix the system, this isn’t about money nor transferring of wealth. I’m doing this for a fair market without manipulation #nakedshorts #ftd you will pay the premium</p>
