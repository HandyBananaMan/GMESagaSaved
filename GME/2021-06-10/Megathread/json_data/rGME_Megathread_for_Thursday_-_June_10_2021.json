To add to the evidence that the share count was modified because it was likely over, there was a [typo in the count sumbission](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw9sl1/math_error_in_8k_filing_possible_a_typo_that/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) on top of the typo the share count was disclosed rather quickly, probably because there would be [no need for anymore excess votes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw8s0l/smooth_brain_math_regarding_the_vote_count/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). There were also brokers that [didn't send the vote\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc0d](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw5xmi/degiro_didnt_send_my_votes_other_borkers_didnt/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), all of this together is just a reminder that GameStop is a unicorn and [none of this is normal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw9uq4/the_number_of_votes_equals_the_entire_float_on/) so that 55 Million is most likely underestimated, how underestimated? No way to know yet, so here's [an estimation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw8bw6/retail_may_own_300_of_the_float/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) based on previous share votes and [here's another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvshu8/short_interest_calculation_based_on_share/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) based on share dilution calculating the short interest\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n* The Dip that came today was an [Massive ETF Shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw7d1v/etf_shorts_proof/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), Dip is optional but it goes great with \ud83c\udf57s \ud83d\ude0b. For those baby \ud83e\udd8ds shaken by the dip this should Reinforce those \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c here's a [chart of higher lows](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nvue84/in_case_any_diamond_hands_needed_to_see/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), the Floor is the highest it's ever been \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 also here's some [fundemental anaylisis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt31x2/came_for_the_memes_stayed_for_the_fundamentals_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and some [data based on Suppy/Demand history](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nvh9qh/supplying_the_demand_and_quanting_even_more_6821/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8ds know the wat, now the new \ud83e\udd8ds need to learn the way \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c.\n* To end here's [Charles Pain the legend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvwh0z/how_did_i_not_see_this_until_today_i_want_them_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) fighting with the \ud83e\udd8d fight.\n* Look forward to another awesome day \ud83e\udd8ds \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Buy, Hodl, Buckle Up!.
