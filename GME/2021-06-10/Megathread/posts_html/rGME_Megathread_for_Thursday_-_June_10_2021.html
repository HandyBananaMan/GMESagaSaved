<li>Good Morning/Night 🦍s, im seeing alot of questions and opportunity for confusion/FUD so im doing another Mega back to back honor of 6/9 🥂 and to bring the 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀s back.</li>
<li>🦍s had an exciting day, GameStop Released <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw6dfa/gamestop_releases_vote_count_55m_shares_est/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">the vote count</a> of 55 Million votes, now It should have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw7e5y/dd_heres_what_happens_if_there_is_over_voting/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">mentioned before hand</a>, but it's impossible to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw8nic/you_cant_report_an_overvote_on_an_8k_pass_it_on/h17q7nc?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">get an over count</a> as the system doesn't accept more votes then shares eligible to vote. To add to the evidence that the share count was modified because it was likely over, there was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw9sl1/math_error_in_8k_filing_possible_a_typo_that/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">typo in the count sumbission</a> on top of the typo the share count was disclosed rather quickly, probably because there would be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw8s0l/smooth_brain_math_regarding_the_vote_count/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">no need for anymore excess votes</a>. There were also brokers that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw5xmi/degiro_didnt_send_my_votes_other_borkers_didnt/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">didn't send the vote🐍🐍🐍</a>, all of this together is just a reminder that GameStop is a unicorn and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw9uq4/the_number_of_votes_equals_the_entire_float_on/">none of this is normal</a> so that 55 Million is most likely underestimated, how underestimated? No way to know yet, so here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw8bw6/retail_may_own_300_of_the_float/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">an estimation</a> based on previous share votes and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvshu8/short_interest_calculation_based_on_share/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">here's another one</a> based on share dilution calculating the short interest🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.</li>
<li>The Dip that came today was an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw7d1v/etf_shorts_proof/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Massive ETF Shorting</a>, Dip is optional but it goes great with 🍗s 😋. For those baby 🦍s shaken by the dip this should Reinforce those 💎🙌 here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nvue84/in_case_any_diamond_hands_needed_to_see/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">chart of higher lows</a>, the Floor is the highest it's ever been 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 also here's some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt31x2/came_for_the_memes_stayed_for_the_fundamentals_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">fundemental anaylisis</a> and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nvh9qh/supplying_the_demand_and_quanting_even_more_6821/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">data based on Suppy/Demand history</a>. 💎🙌🦍s know the wat, now the new 🦍s need to learn the way 💎🙌.</li>
