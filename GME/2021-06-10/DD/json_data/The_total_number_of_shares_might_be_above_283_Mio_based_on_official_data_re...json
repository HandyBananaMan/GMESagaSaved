    "selftext": "**TL;DR: I estimated the total number of shares to be 283.199.842 or higher based on official data from the dutch financial authority and bloomberg data. The estimate is conservative.** \n\nI was wondering why no one did that before. I'm at work, so I'll make it quick. Also, I am not able to post at r/superstonk so please feel free to crosspost!\n\nThe Dutch Authority for Financial MarketsThere recently published data on GME shareholders in the Netherlands. (Link1: [https://www.afm.nl/\\~/profmedia/files/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch/afm-market-watch-3-eng.pdf?la=en](https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch/afm-market-watch-3-eng.pdf?la=en) Link2: [https://www.tellerreport.com/business/2021-06-09-dutch-investors-bought-thousands-of-dollars-worth-of-gamestop-shares.HkxvTjaCqu.html](https://www.tellerreport.com/business/2021-06-09-dutch-investors-bought-thousands-of-dollars-worth-of-gamestop-shares.HkxvTjaCqu.html))\n\nI'm using the following data (Fig 1)\n\n[Fig 1](https://preview.redd.it/b582pe5whf471.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6c778aa516ea9761ab9eef3648977ac284e0d6a)\n\nFrom Jan 18 to Mar 18, there have been:\n\n29,394 individual shareholders bought an average of 61 shares (11,532$/189$)\n\n\\--> the dutch bought 1.793.500 (29,394\\*61) shares during that period alone\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig 2](https://preview.redd.it/ayriq62iof471.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a5b49191033427750ad69dd67fae303e2707081)\n\nLet's be conservative here and assume that a **massive amount** of dutch people paperhanded and only 30% (!) of those share were held by the end of that period.\n\n\\--> that would leave us with  1.793.500\\*0.3 = 538.080 shares held on Mar 18. \n\nI was looking for older shots from a bloomberg terminal (thanks to u/ravada for uploading). The earliest appearance of the Netherlands was on May 09 (0.19% ownership, Fig 3).\n\nSo unfortunately, we do not know the ownership as of Mar 18. However, based on Fig 2 and the GME chart from Mar 18 to May 09, I assume that there has been no significant paperhading in that period. Very likely, the dutch have bought even more shares, so the ownership% on Mar 18 was potentially even lower than 0.19%. (from May09 to May30 the ownership% increases to 0.32%, Fig 4)\n\n[Fig 3](https://preview.redd.it/80c4p4rwpf471.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=63af80464b996ab0e68a8b70ba0c47e4229d7e8a)\n\n[Fig 4](https://preview.redd.it/3p4d2yh5qf471.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=4def5a500d13a447e68c0ceda40e86874b6350e0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat leaves us with: \n\n538.080 shares held by the dutch on Mar 18 (potentially higher)\n\n0.19% of GME are owned by the dutch on Mar 18 (potentially lower)\n\n538.080 / 0.0019 = **283.199.842** Total amount of shares on Mar 18\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI truely have 0 wrinkles. Please let me know if I'm completely wrong here.",
