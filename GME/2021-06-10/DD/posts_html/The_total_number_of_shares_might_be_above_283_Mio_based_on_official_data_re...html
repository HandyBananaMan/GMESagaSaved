<p><strong>TL;DR: I estimated the total number of shares to be 283.199.842 or higher based on official data from the dutch financial authority and bloomberg data. The estimate is conservative.</strong> </p>
<p>I was wondering why no one did that before. I'm at work, so I'll make it quick. Also, I am not able to post at r/superstonk so please feel free to crosspost!</p>
<p>The Dutch Authority for Financial MarketsThere recently published data on GME shareholders in the Netherlands. (Link1: <a href="https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch/afm-market-watch-3-eng.pdf?la=en">https://www.afm.nl/\~/profmedia/files/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch/afm-market-watch-3-eng.pdf?la=en</a> Link2: <a href="https://www.tellerreport.com/business/2021-06-09-dutch-investors-bought-thousands-of-dollars-worth-of-gamestop-shares.HkxvTjaCqu.html">https://www.tellerreport.com/business/2021-06-09-dutch-investors-bought-thousands-of-dollars-worth-of-gamestop-shares.HkxvTjaCqu.html</a>)</p>
<p>I'm using the following data (Fig 1)</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/b582pe5whf471.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6c778aa516ea9761ab9eef3648977ac284e0d6a">Fig 1</a></p>
<p>From Jan 18 to Mar 18, there have been:</p>
<p>29,394 individual shareholders bought an average of 61 shares (11,532$/189$)</p>
<p>--&gt; the dutch bought 1.793.500 (29,394*61) shares during that period alone</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ayriq62iof471.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5b49191033427750ad69dd67fae303e2707081">Fig 2</a></p>
<p>Let's be conservative here and assume that a <strong>massive amount</strong> of dutch people paperhanded and only 30% (!) of those share were held by the end of that period.</p>
<p>--&gt; that would leave us with  1.793.500*0.3 = 538.080 shares held on Mar 18. </p>
<p>I was looking for older shots from a bloomberg terminal (thanks to u/ravada for uploading). The earliest appearance of the Netherlands was on May 09 (0.19% ownership, Fig 3).</p>
<p>So unfortunately, we do not know the ownership as of Mar 18. However, based on Fig 2 and the GME chart from Mar 18 to May 09, I assume that there has been no significant paperhading in that period. Very likely, the dutch have bought even more shares, so the ownership% on Mar 18 was potentially even lower than 0.19%. (from May09 to May30 the ownership% increases to 0.32%, Fig 4)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That leaves us with: </p>
<p>538.080 shares held by the dutch on Mar 18 (potentially higher)</p>
<p>0.19% of GME are owned by the dutch on Mar 18 (potentially lower)</p>
<p>538.080 / 0.0019 = <strong>283.199.842</strong> Total amount of shares on Mar 18</p>

<p>I truely have 0 wrinkles. Please let me know if I'm completely wrong here.</p>
