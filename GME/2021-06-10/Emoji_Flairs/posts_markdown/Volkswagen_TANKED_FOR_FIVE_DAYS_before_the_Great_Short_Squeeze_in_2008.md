Just one reason I am not worried about todays tanking of price, among all the other info that has been discussed. I started looking into the structure of short squeezes a few weeks ago (They're all a bit different, but there's some similarities)  and for some unknow reason have yet to close this tab on my browser. Felt like a good time to share it with everyone.
