Apes are just used to things like this happen. 

I find it very funny to drive the price down after very very bullish reports and news. 

Apes know apes own the float several times, the price is artificial and apes know apes will win as long as apes buy and hold.

No, apes are not suddenly just selling all our stock, and not everyone from all so called “meme stock” is suddenly selling because of some GME news.

It’s very obvious they are desperate, it’s obvious they are in the deep and apes just need to take this chance to buy the dip!!!

Flash sale wuuuuujuuuuu!! Buckle up!

Jacked to the tits!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
