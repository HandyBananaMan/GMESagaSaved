<p>Apes are just used to things like this happen. </p>
<p>I find it very funny to drive the price down after very very bullish reports and news. </p>
<p>Apes know apes own the float several times, the price is artificial and apes know apes will win as long as apes buy and hold.</p>
<p>No, apes are not suddenly just selling all our stock, and not everyone from all so called “meme stock” is suddenly selling because of some GME news.</p>
<p>It’s very obvious they are desperate, it’s obvious they are in the deep and apes just need to take this chance to buy the dip!!!</p>
<p>Flash sale wuuuuujuuuuu!! Buckle up!</p>
<p>Jacked to the tits!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>No financial advice. I’m a monkeyyyy</p>
