<p>Firstly, I want to preclude this by acknowledging it's easy to post this when despite averaging up you're still 1xx@1xx and in the green as of today. A lot of apes would've bought in recently and the majority of x and xx is now probably in the red. It is more important than ever that every ape understands that we've all been here before - we've even been WORSE before. More than ever in this history of this rollercoaster you need to trust your fellow apes, because there are thousands and thousands of me that are not going ANYWHERE! When this is all said and done we will have picked up every single ape and joined that beautiful astronaut on the moon with beer, wine, weed or whatever vice you retarded apes enjoy.</p>
<p>Some basic facts on why this was a brilliantly timed short attack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1 results are through the roof</li>
<li>Shareholder meeting has now come and gone</li>
<li>5 millions shares are being added to revenue raise (not a bad thing - more capital than Gamestop and still not a drop in the ocean of HF shorted position)</li>
<li>The weekend is almost here</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect this thing to get worse before it gets better. If you're new here do not be deterred or disheartened. It is not a loss until you sell. Who knows how low this dip will go, but since March I have been saving and waiting for the OPPORTUNITY to buy more. The DD has not changed, if you can't buy then you just need to HODL. We all have a role to play in changing the corrupt financial system forever. Do not even entertain the thought up giving up now. </p>
<p>TLDR: Everything IS fine; do NOT dance; HODL costs you nothing; we ARE coming for every single ape.</p>
<p>I LOVE YOU ALL</p>
