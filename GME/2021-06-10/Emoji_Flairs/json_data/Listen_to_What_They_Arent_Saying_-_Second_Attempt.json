    "selftext": "I made a comment earlier and people responded saying this belonged as it\u2019s own post. And I got one bit of FUD in response that led me to do a bit more digging. So here is a very small, smooth brained bit of DD that should be easy to verify.\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\nI think the most interesting thing right now is what GME is not saying. The 8-K removed information about total share count. The earnings call was super short and didn't allow questions. They had almost no forward looking statements. They aren't tipping their hand directly about their NFT plans. They are avoiding talking directly about a massive online community/movement. Everything is a \u201cjust the facts\u201d posture.\n\nThis screams lawyers are telling them to be very careful. My confirmation bias says they are worried they are going to be sued for share manipulation causing the MOASS. They would only have this concern if they thought the MOASS was going to happen.\n\nA company isn't going to avoid talking up all of their future plans lightly. Most all of the future plan expectations are coming from Apes predicting based on GME actions. Almost all of the communication from GME is about things they have done or are actively doing. \"We hired these people.\" \"We are building this distribution center.\" etc.\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\nOne response I got was that the earnings call last quarter was also short and didn\u2019t allow questions. So this is no big deal? I listen to a decent number of investor calls and this still struck me as odd. Every investor call I\u2019ve ever listened to for other companies has been much more full of forward looking hype and allowed analyst questions at the end. But, maybe this random commenter was right and that\u2019s just not how it\u2019s done at GME.\n\nWrong!\n\nTheir earnings calls have always been much more detailed before this one (Q1 2021) and the last one (Q4 2020). The obvious fuckery had already started before the last call, so it\u2019s no surprise that one was different too.\n\nHow do I know? I went through the earnings call transcripts for the last 8 quarters. That\u2019s as old as Motley Fool\u2019s transcripts go back that I can find, but I spot checked even older ones from other services and saw similar trends.\n\nFor each call I pulled out the number of minutes the call lasted, roughly how many words were in the transcript (to make sure the duration wasn\u2019t due to some long technical glitch) and saw if there were analysts who attended and asked questions.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Earnings Call Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/wgw3nbvjhi471.png?width=346&format=png&auto=webp&s=aafd30c12cc872e8b3adce05a7d1c49d42e8fd22)\n\nBefore Q4 2020 all of the calls were much longer (over 5x) and all allowed analysts to participate with questions.\n\nAre we really to believe GME has that much less to talk about now? With everything going on, the only thing they can bother to tell a fanatic investor base is a fraction of what they used to share? And unless I missed it somewhere, I don\u2019t believe there has been any reference to why analysts weren\u2019t invited to ask questions. They don\u2019t think their investors have any questions about what\u2019s going on?\n\nGME is keeping tight lipped for a reason. I think it\u2019s because their lawyers are telling them to avoid any culpability when this thing moons.\n\nMy tits are jacked, my brain is smooth, and this is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I keep buying, I keep hodl\u2019ing and I\u2019m all buckled up. You do you ape.\n\nSources:\n\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/10/gamestop-gme-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/10/gamestop-gme-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/24/gamestop-gme-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/03/24/gamestop-gme-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/12/09/gamestop-gme-q3-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/09/10/gamestop-gme-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/09/10/gamestop-gme-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/06/09/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q1-2020-earnings-call-transc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/06/09/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q1-2020-earnings-call-transc.aspx)\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/26/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q4-2019-earnings-call-transc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/26/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q4-2019-earnings-call-transc.aspx)\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/12/10/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q3-2019-earnings-call-transc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/12/10/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q3-2019-earnings-call-transc.aspx)\n* [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/09/11/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q2-2019-earnings-call-transc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/09/11/gamestop-corp-new-gme-q2-2019-earnings-call-transc.aspx)\n\nI don\u2019t have the karma to post on r/SuperStonk and I\u2019m far too smooth brained to know how to farm karma. So feel free to cross post this if it\u2019s interesting.\n\n\\----------------------\n\nEdit:\n\nSo you say this is just a Ryan Cohen thing. He kept Chewy close to the vest, so this is just his normal playbook.\n\nWrong Again!\n\nI quickly looked at the earnings transcripts for Chewy's quarterly meetings. And just like old GME, the earnings calls have all been much longer and allowed analyst questions. GME is being extremely quiet compared to norms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwcwfojmhk471.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67b564831be82cf7f05afd182e28863be3c3eef\n\n&#x200B;",
