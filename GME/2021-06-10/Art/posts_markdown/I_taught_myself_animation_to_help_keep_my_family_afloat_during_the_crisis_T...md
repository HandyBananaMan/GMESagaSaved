#Title: I taught myself animation to help keep my family afloat during the crisis. This is my resume, which I sent to Gamestop's NFT team today. I hope to turn my hobby into a profession and be part of Gamestop's exciting future. It is still incomplete so let me know what you want to see in the finale.
