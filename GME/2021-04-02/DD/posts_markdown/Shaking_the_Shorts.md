Hello Apes!

I am NOT a financial advisor. This is NOT advice.

Edit: a lot of comments are confusing this with share lending restrictions. That's not what this post is about. Even if your "shares" aren't lent out, they could in fact be FTRs and not actual shares at all. Read on...  

I think I might have found the catalyst that could trigger the MOASS... need help fleshing it out.

GME was clearly the victim of naked short selling. I can see no other explanation for how the short interest exceeded the float.

Further evidence of naked short selling is the skyrocketing Failure to Deliver (FTD) levels. As I understand it, the working theory is that these FTDs are still in play but being masked by deep ITM options.

FTDs, and the corresponding Failure to Receive (FTRs), are basically assets and liabilities, respectively, on the books of the NSCC, which acts as the clearing arm of the DTCC.

As I understand it, FTDs are collateralized at the NSCC in a marked-to-market fashion, along with cash adjustments (which can only go up, not down) that reflect - as I understand it - the collateral required to ensure the ability to purchase the actual shares. This doesn't have much impact during the course of routine trading, because of how FTRs are shuffled between traders.

When a trader purchases the stock, they may actually not receive shares. The NSCC's algorithms may choose to give them FTRs instead (IOUs, essentially). Clearly, as a result, in a stock such as GME many of the "shares" floating around and being held in diamond hands are actually just IOUs.

Our brokers, NSCC "participants", can demand the shares corresponding to their FTRs in a process called a "buy-in notice". Normally, this only actually results in the NSCC shuffling FTRs around so that some new sucker gets your FTR instead of a share, and the participant that issued the "buy-in" gets the shares. It doesn't result in the FTD short having to cover, in other words.

HOWEVER, if every FTR participant was compelled by their clients to issue "buy-in notices" because, say, their clients demanded the voting rights which are not given to FTR holders... and there was ridiculously low trading volume (not enough new buyers to hand off those FTRs to)... I think this might result in the buy-in orders actually making it through the system to the FTD shorts.

When a buy-in order makes it through to an FTD short, as I understand it, it's merciless.Their settlement account is debited the total collateral amount for the FTD shares held on the NSCC's books at that time (marked-to-market + cash adjustments) which can be significantly more than the current market price (recall the collateral only goes up, not down).

Unless I'm totally misunderstanding this (or missing something, which is likely) then what could happen if all us apes get wrinkles and demand actual shares (not FTRs) from our brokerages... the resulting buy-in notices would cause a massive default on the FTD short side of things, *oldest FTDs first*, which might in turn cause a chain reaction that would be hellish to unwind due to collateral reuse (rehypothication).

Also, participants who are net long in the stock can lend their shares into the NSCC to help them cover FTRs, and benefit from the marked-to-market collateral being credited to their account as a loan they can make money off of. This - I think - would result in a drop in the FTR positions, though I'm not clear on how that would work)

I would love input from someone with many more wrinkles than I have.

TLDR: the NSCC is a middleman between longs and shorts, that shuffles around IOUs (FTD/FTR) until they're forced by collateralized participants to cough up actual shares, at which point they slam FTDs with obligations **which can be far pricier than the market price of the shares**. The process is called a "buy-in notice" and brokers don't like doing it to one another because they don't want it done back to them. But FTRs have no voting rights. So if apes want to vote in a shareholder vote... they would need actual shares and not FTRs. 

TLDR TLDR: Shareholders should demand the right to exercise their right to vote, and insist their brokers not accept FTRs in lieu of shares.

EDITS:

**This is NOT about whether your shares can be lent out. If anything, it's about whether you have voting rights or not (specifically, whether you own shares or FTRs). The answer may vary by individual account or even transaction, and requires individual confirmation from your broker.**

According to one response, actually voting might lock your ability to sell your shares for 60 days. As of yet, **I cannot confirm this** to be true. I've contacted GameStop investor relations for a clarification. Note that actually voting, or recalling your shares, is somewhat besides the point of this post, which aims to highlight FTRs and the buy-in process visavis the NSCC.

"Hi.

There is a very important shareholder vote coming up for GME. Please confirm ASAP that I will be able to exercise my <number of shares owned> votes in this shareholder vote.

Furthermore, due to the unprecedented levels of FTDs in this stock, I would like you to confirm my shares are not FTRs (which do not have voting rights) or otherwise lent. If they are in fact FTRs, please initiate a buy-in to ensure I will be able to vote.

Thanks,
