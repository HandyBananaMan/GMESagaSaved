<h1>Welcome Apes to a fun little class on Short Squeezes and why this might be the last of them (Edit:  Should be Modern Era...at least you know I really am an Ape....lol)</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>I'm just a dumb Marine ape who enjoys the little things. BBQ Crayons, a cold beer, and short hedge fund tears. Ya know, the little things.</p>
<p>The market is closed today so I decided to do a little history lesson. I will not be citing my work because fuck you, I'm not in school anymore and I'm doing this for people who eat crayons/follow memes for stock advice. Also I'm only including major stock market ones and not forex, futures, or agricultural ones.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>(Edit 1:  In the beginning I was just adding short squeezes that ran up quickly and aggressively.  I didn't include slower ones like Tesla which one could argue is still squeezing.  I've taken from the comments we should see them all so I'm including all them here now.  If I miss one let me know.</h1>

<p>Edit 2:  Overstock Will do a write up on them but did they really squeeze???  I think it got shutdown before it started with the digital dividend think but I'll research it more.  I know they got out from most of the shorts but I'll provide an update as I research now.( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ponderous_Platypus11/">Ponderous_Platypus</a> What about Overstock?

<h1>Panic of 1901: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1901</a></h1>
<h1>May 1901</h1>
<p>Basically, Harriman, Schiff, Hill, and JP Morgan all were involved in control over Northern Pacific Railway. Hill was backed/allied by JP Morgan and Harriman was on the other side trying to control it. The two parties were fighting over 94% of the company which caused the stock to rise up quickly. It was peaking on May 7th 1901. People lined up to short the stock because they didn't understand why the company was running up. One day later on May 8th people began to realized they sold more shares short than existed float and neither side of Hill/Morgan or Harriman would sell because they were battling for control of the Northern Pacific Railroad . This caused the stock of Northern Pacific Railway to rise 16 1/2 points that day while the broader market liquated assets of those who needed to cover dropped out from underneath them.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Basically 2 parties went head to head over control of a railroad company. Prices were rising fast.People shorted it without understanding what was happening, neither railroad party would sell and those who shorted the railroad company got liquated causing a stock market crash aka "Panic of 1901".</p>

<h1>1923 Piggly Wiggly: <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/02/piggly-wiggly-short-squeeze-gamestop-wall-street-nyse.html">https://slate.com/business/2021/02/piggly-wiggly-short-squeeze-gamestop-wall-street-nyse.html</a></h1>
<p>1923:  ***FYI not a happy ending*** So this was added later and not part of my original post, I didn't come across this one until u/madejesse pointed it out.  But I'll add but it counts since it was in the market.  Basically the owner of Piggly Wiggly, Clarence Saunders, was a country boy and started a really successful business.  He pioneered self shopping (Basically the modern grocery store) and grew rich.  His company was listed on the NY stock exchange.  He became super rich.  After some stores did not catch on in NY, CT, NH etc. some shorts decided to short his company.  He doesn't know anything about stocks but gets pissed that someone is shorting his stock so he decides to take out a 10 million dollar loan (Todays worth would be about 150 million) and buys up almost all the remaining stock.  Shorts shit their pants as the stock goes from $39 a share to $60 within months then it jumps up to $75 a share then $124 as he calls back all the shares.  Papers deem him the winner and people like he took on the Wall Street Giants.</p>
<p>As the price gets over $124 the NYSE indefinitely suspended all trading and the rumors of them pulling the stock sends the price down to $82 hours later.  Saunders offers to let short sellers sell at an even $150 a share or the price would go to $250 the next day but the shorts refuse.  March 22nd they ban Piggly Wiggly from the exchange and he ends up trying to settle.  Shorts were giving extra time to close positions and they snake shares settling for far less.  The stock now losing value by the second end ups settling since he has to pay back that huge loan. Saunders ends up losing everything and was cheated by the system.  He lost his pink mansion as well.  Fuck...seems like these Wall Street Fucks have been doing this since the market was founded.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>  Not a happy ending but basically the owner of Piggly Wiggly took on Wall Street and was beating them for a while.  They changed the rules and shut down the stock.  This 10 years before the SEC would be founded and sounds like the he got boned hard.  He also lost his pink mansion.  Fuck Wall Street....</p>

<h1>Tesla:  The long squeeze (2005ish to present)</h1>
<p>A lot of people are calling for Tesla on here.  The reason I didn't included it originally is because one, it's not done squeezing in my opinion.  In my humble opinion, this is how short interest should operate.  People thought Tesla was overvalued, so they shorted.  People went long and Tesla kept defying all odds by releasing enough information to keep people bullish about the future.  (Starting to sound familiar?)  The price of the stock was hard to take down since so many investors kept buying into it when it dipped.  (Also sounding familiar?)  Shorts then would have to buy back their shares sending the stock higher and then Elon would raise money to fund a new project.  Rinse and repeat every couple months.</p>
<p>Every time a new short would jump on, the cycle would start over again.  I'd argue it's still squeezing like right now.  It was not a 1 time event, it's like a monthly event for them.  lol</p>

<h1>2008 VW Infinity Squeeze: <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/</a></h1>
<p><strong>Brief History:</strong> 2006 Porsche makes a surprise announcement they are increasing their position in V W. The stock starts to rise and short hedge funds think the company is overvalued so they begin to short V W. By 2008 these short positions have ballooned hugely. Porsche now owns 43% of V W shares and 32% of them in options and the government owned 20.2%. Totaled up that is Porsche now owns control of 75 %  of 79.8% of the company that can be bought.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 2008</strong></p>
<p>2008 the world markets crashed. V W was seen as a target for bankruptcy as they had serious debt problems. High debt and bleak look on car sales during a financial meltdown. Shorts aggressively piled onto them even further. While this was going on, Porsche began buying up even more underlying shares of V W in an attempted takeover of majority ownership. Buying up this last 12.8% of the stock, the shorts were exposed on how much over their positions were against the float and the result was the stock going from 210.85 to over 1000 euros in 2 days. Porsche CEO was charged with market manipulation but was acquitted. They worked out a deal with the Short Hedge Funds to let them by back shares for billions of dollars. Short hedge funds lost 30 billion while Porsche made billions.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Porsche sneakily basically acted as its own long hedge fund and short squoze the crap out hedge funds like a boss. They basically just bought up all the underlying shares over 2 years and then bought up the last 12.8% and squoze the shit out of shorts. Shorts lost 30 billion and Porsche made billions.</p>

<p>After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.</p>
<p>The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.</p>
<p>But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.</p>
<p>Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.</p>
<p>The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.</p>
<p>Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.</p>
<p>“There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.</p>
<p>Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.</p>
<p>Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.</p>
<p>Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.</p>
<p>“Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.</p>
<p>Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.</p>
<p>But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.</p>
<p>“We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.</p>
<p>Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.</p>
<p>Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.</p>
<p>Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.</p>
<p>Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.</p>

<h1>2012 MAAX Bond market squeeze : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone</a></h1>
<h1>This one I'm going to cheat and just copy and paste. I didn't know much about this one so I don't have a take.</h1>
<p>2012 securities fraud charge[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Falcone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4&amp;editintro=Template:BLP_editintro">edit</a>]</p>
<p><em>See also:</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze"><em>Short squeeze</em></a></p>
<p>On June 27, 2012, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> filed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_fraud">securities fraud</a> charges against Falcone and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbinger_Capital_Partners">Harbinger Capital Partners</a>, alleging that Falcone "used fund assets [of $113.2 million] to pay his taxes, conducted an illegal '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_squeeze">short squeeze</a>' to manipulate bond prices, secretly favored certain customers at the expense of others, and that Harbinger unlawfully bought equity securities in a public offering, after having sold short the same security during a restricted period."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The short squeeze was performed by Falcone in relation to a series of high-yield bonds issued by M A A X Holdings. After hearing that a firm was shorting the bonds, Falcone purchased the entire issue of bonds. He also lent the bonds to the short-sellers, and then bought them back when the traders sold them. As a result, his total exposure exceeded the entire issue of the M A A X bonds. Falcone then stopped lending the bonds, so that short-sellers could not liquidate their positions anymore. The price of the bonds rose dramatically.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-NYT_120628-20">[20]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-MS_210126-21">[21]</a> The short-sellers could only liquidate their positions by contacting Falcone directly.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-MS_210126-21">[21]</a></p>
<p>In May 2013, he accepted an SEC settlement in which he and Harbinger agreed to pay a total of $18 million. Under the deal, Falcone would have been banned from operating as an investment advisor for two years.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-22">[22]</a> However, in a rare move, the commissioners overruled the enforcement staff and threw out the deal, forcing the two sides back to the bargaining table. Reportedly, SEC chairwoman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jo_White">Mary Jo White</a> felt the deal was too lenient. Finally, on August 19, the SEC and Falcone agreed to a deal in which he and Harbinger admitted breaking the law. It was the first SEC settlement in years in which the defendant was required to admit wrongdoing; usually, defendants who accept SEC settlements neither admit nor deny that they broke the securities laws.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-NYTWrongdoing-23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Falcone will have to pay a total of $11.5 million of his own money to settle the charges. He will <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgorgement_(law)">disgorge</a> a total of $6.5 million in illicit profits and pay $1.01 million in prejudgment interest and $4 million in civil penalties, and also accepted a five-year ban from the securities industry. By comparison, the May deal required him to pay only $4 million out of his own pocket. Harbinger will pay $6.5 million in civil penalties. Falcone admitted to siphoning off $113.2 million of Harbinger assets to pay his personal state and federal taxes and pay customer redemptions to favored clients. He also admitted to manipulating the bond price of MAAX Holdings, a Canadian bathroom products manufacturer, by buying up all of the outstanding bonds and demanding that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> settle all outstanding MAAX transactions and deliver the bonds it owed. Falcone was well aware Goldman couldn't deliver the bonds because all of them were tied up by Harbinger.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-NYTWrongdoing-23">[23]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-24">[24]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-25">[25]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-26">[26]</a></p>
<p>On July 4, 2014, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_Office_of_the_Whistleblower">SEC Office of the Whistleblower</a> rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Falcone#cite_note-27">[27]</a></p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>  This was a dude Philip Falcone who basically understood how the bond game worked and would squeeze out companies/people.</p>
<h1>2015 Wall Street Bets Bro Martin Shkreli: <a href="https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/">https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/</a></h1>
<h1>Nov 19th 2015:</h1>
<p>KaloBios Infinity Squeeze: Another company hugely in debt. A no brainer to short. Fresh off a failed drug test and 6 million in debt Martin puts together a massive short squeeze which lead to 10,000% stock rise in 5 trading days.</p>
<p>Over shorted, After the close on November 19th, K B I O released a second announcement, stating that the group had now acquired a full <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1293310/000110465915080846/a15-23985_1ex99d1.htm">70% of outstanding shares</a> and that Shkreli had been appointed as KBIO’s new CEO and Chairman.  Shkreli’s group had stated that it would inject an initial $3 million in cash with an additional $10 million following shareholder approval.  By November 23rd, KBIO had briefly hit $45 per share.  But, even then Shkreli was not yet finished with his plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Phase two. Forced borrow recall</em></strong>*.* After briefly hitting $45, K B I O quickly retreated into the $20s.  After all, it was still just a defunct biotech stock without a real drug. Even with a bit of cash from Shkreli, the stock was worth nowhere near a market cap of over $200 million.  Short sellers piled in to short more in the $20’s on the basis that “this was just a squeeze” that would quickly fall apart.</p>
<p>As K B I O’s share price had been spiking, short interest had been growing.  And Shkreli now owned 70% of the outstanding shares.   Then on Thanksgiving Day 2015, when markets were closed, Shkreli tweeted that he had decided to recall his K B I O shares that had been lent out to short sellers.  The resulting squeeze was just a simple math problem.  When Shkreli recalled his shares, brokers would be forced to buy-in the short sellers, causing it to spike uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Just learning about this one.  I'll write up something for it since I missed it but it's on the list so we can have an accurate account.  If I miss them, call them out and I'll add them.</p>

<p>Blue Apron:</p>

<h1>GameStop 2020 to Present: This is now!!</h1>
<p>You should know these details but think about this. The long this goes on, this could be the last major squeeze in history. This is probably what puts sensible rules in place to ensure this never happens again. (I know the DTCC is working on that now to protect their own asses and trying to cover loop holes as we speak)</p>
<p>So here is my thought. I think the DTCC, SEC, Government, all know what is going on. We keep crying for action but I think they already know. Personally, I think they are trying to figure out how to solve this problem without undermining the US Equity Markets. They know it's been corrupt for years but now the average person is just starting to learn about it. They have had the game rigged in their direction since the beginning but this will be the straw that will breaks the camel's back. If they lose creditability, world investors will take their money to other places but they can't do it publicly. They will quietly change the rules and hope this doesn't blow up in their faces.</p>
<p>In reality, people should already be in jail for this because they have/been breaking the law. They don't want that kind of attention because it means the entire system knew and they were complicit. This entire thing could literally bring down the system. So I expect them to protect their own asses first.</p>
<p>This is pure speculation but here is my theory: These new DTCC rules will go into place and they will see how bad all these shorts are fucking up. I don't know what will happen and I hope this goes to the 1.2 million a share or whatever the math people say. I do know that this one is special. The government didn't step in on the other short squeeze cases (Couldn't for VW because it was on the DAX) but they did for this one. The question is why? Why was GameStop the one they couldn't let happen?</p>
<p>I've been thinking about that for days. Why did they let Martin Shkreli run K B I O up 10000% but GameStop HAD to be stopped? Is it because it would expose naked shorting and the corruption of the marketplace as whole? Well, the game didn't stop back in Jan.......it just got kicked down the road.  I keep buying more shares each week.  </p>
<p>You could argue that Tesla is the closest comparison to GameStop. Rabid shareholders who never sell. It's a shorts worse nightmare because they don't act rationally.  Stock is down 195 dollars a share, they buy more.  That's why they keep winning against shorts..  </p>
<p>Tell me your thoughts! I'd love to talk about this with other but wanted to point out what a special thing this is. We are a part of history!</p>
<h1>TLDR:  Only 12 cases of short squeezes starting in 1860.  GameStop is probably the most interesting because it has now continued for months rather than just a one off event short event. Nobody is selling. This is a rare thing in the market and I think it will literally change the rules so this can never happen again.</h1>

<p>Legally, if she says yup you guys are going to crash the entire system and everyone is getting paid, they would sue her for being a catalyst. She knows the system is so corrupt that they will indefinitely be able to hide their positions forever unless the rules on options changes. But wait what is this? DD saying that the DTCC is going to start regulating options.</p>

<p>Literally the worst case scenario is you have to wait for Ryan Cohen's team and board to setup the largest Digital Gaming company and this stock will be worth thousands anyway. Let me explain, the current brick and mortar model cost a good deal to run and switching the business to e-commerce it would become insanely profitable.  If they are doing a couple billion in sales with way less overhead, the stock price will justify a much higher evaluation.  GameStop executives also at any point because our constant buying pressure, should be able to raise up 2 billion dollars worth of capital for only 10 million shares. 2.6 billion in cash and only 300 million in debt is a FUCKING healthy ass company who can buy success and still not dilute the shares. A M C  has over 400 million shares in their float and wants to issue another 500 million to cover their billions in debt , T S L A has over 700 million, GME has 50 in their public float. 60 million total shares to raise 2 billion dollars cash is fucking worth it.</p>
<p>For the smooth brains.  If you issue 10 million shares at 200 dollars that would raise 2 billion dollars.  GameStop's current balance sheet states 600 million in cash and 100 million in short term debt and 200 million in long term debt.  10 million shares is not a huge dilution for raising 2 billion dollars.  So you would have 2.6 billion in cash and only 300 million in debt.  If they could buy major gaming studios if they did it right.)  Remember, I said this was the worst case scenario.  GameStop has 600 million in cash right now to 300 in short and long term debt.  They don't need to dilute the shares to raise money.  This example was just to show you worst case scenario, we will win.....it just takes a little longer.</p>
