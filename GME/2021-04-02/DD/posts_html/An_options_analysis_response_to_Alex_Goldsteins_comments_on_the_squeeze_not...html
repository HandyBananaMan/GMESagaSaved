<p>Hi everyone. It's me, Warden, and I don't usually post on  weekends (I have break today so Friday is part of my 3 day weekend). But anyways, I thought I would share my thoughts on Goldstein's responses in the AMA. I think she's doing the community a great service. I'd like to share some of my thoughts on her responses.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry if my title is a bit misleading. I was referencing her comments on the <em>gamma squeeze</em> as well as her uncertainty on if the MOASS will happen or not.</p>
<h1>Let's talk about the Gamma Squeeze possibility</h1>
<p>First off, she seemed to reference the same thing I referenced in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Option premiums on GameStop/GME implied volatility are still through the roof, too, and I presume will be for some time -- option sellers are going to demand a major premium for taking on risk of it going haywire again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the main rhetoric for why a gamma squeeze cannot happen. For the smooth brains: Call options are extremely expensive because of the high Implied Volatility. High IV leads to higher premiums. <strong>For a gamma squeeze to happen, you need to be able to buy lots of Call options quickly and cheaply.</strong></p>
<p>I mentioned we would squeeze the old fashioned way: through the raw purchasing of shares and through the power of catalysts perhaps in early April. I'd like to provide an update on that thesis.</p>
<p><strong>We've actually seen significant IV crush this last week.</strong> IV crush is basically IV getting crushed. Week after week, the IV has settled down and the prices for Calls has become cheaper.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/091mmyb6gtq61.png?width=2133&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d69b9958517c8e64a30681c903aca62b32e6e72b</p>
<p>The cyan line at the bottom is the Implied Volatility. Notice how it is going down over time.</p>
<p>As you can see, we have settled down back to the IV from before the 2/24 climb. In fact, we've increased the price four fold while decreasing IV. <strong>That is extremely impressive and evidence that bulls have very good control over the recent runup.</strong></p>
<p>I believe they are setting the stage, and may keep the IV crush going for a couple more trading days before they launch their next long attack.</p>
<p>Imagine launching a rocket into space. If you could hypothetically build a launch pad hundreds of miles above the ground, it would be easier to launch your rocket. There's less gravity and less distance, so your rocket can fly further with the same amount of fuel. <strong>I believe bulls are building that launch pad and it is near completion. I believe a gamma squeeze is once again possible for the near future.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, if you zoom in to a smaller timescale, the Implied Volatility is lower than the Historical Volatility. This means the options are priced relatively cheap.</p>

<p>The cyan line, the IV, is lower than the purple line, the HV.</p>
<p>So great, we have a launchpad built that's 4 times higher than January's launch pad. Now what about short interest?</p>
<h1>Is short interest still high?</h1>
<p>Alexis Goldstein also talked about the shorts' positions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to stress that I don't have a crystal ball. I just think enough shorts got burned that people are probably more cautious now than they were before. And anyone selling options on GME are demanding very high premiums for taking the risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My thoughts were, how can you get burned if you haven't covered? In my best judgement, the shorts are still sitting with high unrealized losses and refuse to cover. They certainly are cautious compared to before, but they are still trapped in their losing position. <strong>Retailers have an asymmetric opportunity. They lose nothing by holding, while the shorts lose from interest and option premiums.</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to clarify that in my stream, some people thought I said the SI could be lower than what Fintel reports. I'd like to clarify that misunderstanding. I believe SI could be lower than the theoretical minimum of 130% which is calculated off the Short Volume data. Fintel could over report short volume. However this doesn't mean SI is low. <strong>In fact I believe it is still extremely high over 100%.</strong></p>
<p>What evidence do we have? Well on Wednesday, 3/31, we saw an anomaly appear that hadn't shown up for 2 weeks: the Deep ITM Calls. I believe the last time we spotted these was on 3/17. They've been speculated to use these to reset FTDs.</p>
<p>So ask yourself, why would they need to reset FTDs, if SI is low? That wouldn't make sense, because that would result in fewer synthetic/counterfeit shares. Therefore, I can assume they still have a massive problem with their short position and conclude that SI is still extremely high. Lastly, I believe they have concealed their short interest via options. There are many ways to do this, and this would explain the low short interest Fintel is reporting.</p>

<p>What about institutional ownership? In the Bloomberg terminal, it shows that before January, the institutional ownership was 194%. Now it's 130%. It's probably a bit higher because of how Fidelity filed their position change. I think they moved their 9 million shares to a different alias. So it could be around 140-150%.</p>
<h1>Are long institutions still in it? Is retail holding?</h1>
<p>Now back to Alexis Goldstein.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think GameStop volatility will continue because there are now just too many eyes on it, and too many people with FOMO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>That's exactly right, retail has been FOMOing in but with diamond hands. People aren't selling.</strong></p>
<p>The decrease in institutional ownership doesn't concern me, because I believe that 64% gap was filled by retail in the recent runup. This is why you don't see huge swings downwards recently. The floor has been lifted slowly by retail and now it's harder than ever to short attack.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/7u5otan8gtq61.png?width=2139&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc9208450f7b00c7307e710882ed5ab81628ca90</p>
<p>The gap between these two dotted red lines are filled by retail buying. We really are squeezing them the old fashioned way, via raw buying power.</p>
<p>There's really nothing more dangerous, than a million apes buying shares and holding them. Not even a professional trader in Wall Street can fight that kind of buying power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Goldestein speculates, I too believe big institutions that longed GameStop are still in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I mean hedge funds have a lot of different strategies, and many of them may be long GME at this point -- at least in the short term. This has always been my general thesis: that GME may have been ignited by retail, but there are likely big institutional players involved as well. I spoke about this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa7_KVfMuKo">a bit on the BBC</a>: and at my newsletter: <a href="https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/what-happened-with-gamestop/">https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/what-happened-with-gamestop/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> Edited out the part about Senvest and Maverick. <strong>For the full 13G details on when institutions file:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any changes to the information contained in a Schedule 13G form must be amended through additional reporting. Institutional investors are required to file an amendment to report any changes within 45 days of the end of the year or within 10 days of first finishing a month above 10% and then within 10 days of any month-end where the holder's ownership increases or decreases by 5% or more. Passive investors have similar requirements for reporting amendments.6</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Without 13Gs, judging by the chart, the price has never dropped significantly for a long period of time. Seems the floor has consistently increased as I have speculated in my first stream. We will continue to climb at a steady rate, while occasionally seeing a short attack or two that temporarily disrupts the floor. I see the steady climb as evidence for Long institutions holding.</p>
<h1>Possible catalysts in April.</h1>
<p>As I have mentioned in my second Monday stream, I believe there are plenty of catalysts coming in April. First you have the share recall. If the same shares that are recalled also happened to be shorted, those shares must be covered and there will be a short squeeze. Will we see a short squeeze in April or whenever those shares are recalled for the June shareholder vote? Maybe. It depends, again, on which shares are recalled, and how many shares are recalled. The more shorted shares that get recalled, the better.</p>
<p>Let's not forget about April 4/4, 2020 during the last share recall. SI was high, and the stock skyrocketed to 6.460 from the dip of 2.574. I believe this is proof of the plausibility of my share recall theory.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/xb7kad89gtq61.png?width=2139&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaf9c40d490cfc0fcbf47930b1f3dd17b7bd9d66</p>
<p>There was even an article on it.</p>
<p><img alt="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4336290-gamestop-shareholders-must-call-in-shares-april-20th-to-vote" src="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4336290-gamestop-shareholders-must-call-in-shares-april-20th-to-vote" /></p>
<p>In the article, Justin Dopierala, the President and Founder of DOMO Capital states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, out of the public float of 56.69 million shares, only 24.69 million non-institutional shares are available to trade on a daily basis. Out of these, 14 million shares are held by shareholders that are likely to vote, as previously noted. This leaves only about 10.7 million shares available for shorts to purchase as they are forced to exit their positions (assuming you and I and every other shareholder is willing to sell to them at all). An interesting note here... if these shareholders representing 14 million shares have not yet called in their shares, that by itself creates over a 3 million share deficit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He makes a point that there is a possibility of share deficit. With the recent high short interest as well as the ever shrinking float of freely trading shares (honestly are there even any real shares left?), an infinity squeeze is even more likely.</p>
<p>I'd like to mention that one of my friends who I consider to be my mentor, and who taught me a lot of what I know, mentioned this to me:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/mbsikdr9gtq61.png?width=351&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f01eec62ddf78b34061142267ab5c12999a3aba</p>
<p>I believe that if it is not the share recall that triggers the MOASS, the next most likely thing is the SEC investigations. The recent DD on Collateral re-use is brilliant. I believe it ties into Citadel, Archegos and the SEC investigations. I am doing research over the weekend on this complicated topic, but I have a feeling that things are a lot more interconnected than we realize.</p>
<p>I plan to talk about Statistics, variance and comparing VWAP across exchanges on my Monday stream. I have begun reading more into detecting short squeezes and have started reading an old whitepaper that caught my attention back in February.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Regarding what I said about OBV showing people sold. Yes it shows people sold in January, but right now, OBV shows are are diamond handing like chads. Just want to make that clear.</p>
<p>Ain't nobody selling in Feb or March.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Another Edit:</strong> Let's not forget about the activist takeover. Sherman's contract is possible ending without a renewal in mid April. If Ryan Cohen becomes CEO, that would be huge.</p>
<h1>Addressing some of the drama lately</h1>
<p>So there's been some comments made about me recently on the sub. I'll briefly cover it on my Monday daily post. I have a gallery of threads put together and I'll put it on my post. I believe it should address all the concerns people are having lately. For folks who don't know who I am and haven't read my old posts since the beginning of when I started posting, my gallery and post on Monday should catch you up.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend everyone!</p>
