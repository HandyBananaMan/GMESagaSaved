<p>He was hired on 4/15/19. He got a signing bonus and vested stock schedule that is his to keep so long as he stays through 4/15/21. He has 300K that will vest in June 2021. </p>
<p>I think they are biding their time until 4/16. Hopefully, Ryan Cohen will take over then. </p>
<p>Wondering about DFV’s calls that expire the same day the CEO is fire-able! Are they going to moon before he has to do something with them?</p>
<p>The cat in a banana comes out on 4/20. </p>
