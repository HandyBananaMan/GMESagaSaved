This is a thesis based on Logic, Data, Math, and Facts about Longs joining 🦍s, not financial advise yadada 🚀🚀🚀🚀 

The 🚀 isn't just Inevitable, its Necessary 🚀🚀🚀

Shitedal only has one out and that isn't happening 💎🙌

🦍🧠 Smooth 🦍 can learn anything cause 🦍 know nothing

Gonna start with TLDR

TLDR: The Fed/DTCC/ETC is destroying Naked Shorting, using Jailing Ken and destroying shitedal as PR management and bag holding, inorder to take ownership of Shitedal/Palafox(which is 80% foreign) to fix the Bond Market and giving Tendies to 🦍s to cover up what they do in the back end. Its better to blow up the market on the front end (GME) and recover than let it blow up on the back end (Bond Market) and implode the whole world. The reason any of this is happening is because of 💎🙌(both sides we're complicit in making money through their bond printer, but then 💎🙌 🦍s jammed the printer and turned it into a black hole which forced World War 3 to start: Longs Vs Shorts 

DUH 🤦🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️ new revelation 

*🍗s will create a bull run in Main st and Wall St 🦍s are the safety net from the crash 😁 by paying off debt, all of our families debt and our friends and loved ones debt, Michael Lewis was 1 🦍, 1 🦍 weak, 🦍💪 together that's the most important thing to take away from this 🦍💪 Together*

[ This is it!*](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mippnw/what_a_rare_opportunity_this_community_has_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  I came to the same conclusion thanks to this [TLDR**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhjuyi/the_everything_short_citadel_sec_exemption/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and i was making a write up of it so instead ill just post my thoughts with DD referencing, 


i Believe [Ken/Shitedal is to be the fall guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/mhiil4/61727054_says_ken_is_next/) and i think the DTCC/FED NEED to own Shitedal to fix what Palafox ([Subsidy of Shitedal](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)) has done to the [US bond Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhqvee/reverse_repo_rate_for_today_is_at_134_billion_usd/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), Ken will go down as the mastermind and 🦍s will be given unlimited Tendies [to pay off home debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/miuqrp/200813/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [Treasury debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mjv3oj/the_great_reset_the_laundry_machine_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) solidifying the market and creating a bull run in main st and wall st🚀🚀🦍s will become the safety net of the market through 🍗s😁, the 🚀 will be set off [ by a historical Margin call on Shitedal***]( https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc0zfn/too_ape_didnt_read_summary_of_srnscc2021801/). In order pull this off the DTCC [is stopping naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi3xdt/dtcc_new_proposed_rule_change_dtc2021005/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), the FED allowed the leveraging rules to expire along with the [DTCC rule changes****](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgrx9n/new_dtcc_filing_30_march_recalculating/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) which is [forcing mass deleveraging of Shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhew67/109m_sell_candle_at_close_on_the_dow_jones_to_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) so "Innocent" GME shorts are forced to close which [Shitedal will never do](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhwf5o/apes_proof_there_is_no_volume_other_than_naked/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as [they have no cloths](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the DTCC are also [preventing new shorts from being placed via the Rebate Rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgva26/gme_borrow_rates_do_reflect_a_hardtoborrow/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) in fact they are so prepared for massive deleveraging they expect it to [break the NSCC repeatedly*****](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhx3p8/i_have_translated_srnscc2021004approvalnotice/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) this will simultaneously remove the overextended shorts from most balance sheets and leave the largest bag of excrement the world has ever known in Shitedals hands. [Also another reminder that Shitedal plays by its own rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mh93dp/is_it_true_the_sec_exempted_citadel_from_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)


 i also have a feeling that Shitedal and friends married the Treasury Bond and GME Shorts (which is probably why the 🚀 won't happen until the massive deleveraging is done throughout the market to prevent the 🚀 from simultaneously destorying the Bond Market) [this is my reason for that hunch](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgl19d/calling_smart_ape_yahoo_high_volume_graph/) and the [negative beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfhszf/gme_adjusted_beta_23735_bloomberg_terminal/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is another reason, Trillions of GME shares in volume, this shouldn't be possible, me thinks GME shorts are being used by Palafox/Shitedal with the Repo market is some way (gonna need a smart 🦍 to see if that has any merrit)

*S below for direct quotes that lead to/explain my conclusion above

*"So here is my thought. I think the DTCC, SEC, Government, all know what is going on. We keep crying for action but I think they already know. Personally, I think they are trying to figure out how to solve this problem without undermining the US Equity Markets. They know it's been corrupt for years but now the average person is just starting to learn about it. They have had the game rigged in their direction since the beginning but this will be the straw that will breaks the camel's back. If they lose creditability, world investors will take their money to other places but they can't do it publicly. They will quietly change the rules and hope this doesn't blow up in their faces.

In reality, people should already be in jail for this because they have/been breaking the law. They don't want that kind of attention because it means the entire system knew and they were complicit. This entire thing could literally bring down the system. So I expect them to protect their own asses first."

**"TLDR: Blackrock, RC Ventures, the Fed, the government, the SEC, the DTCC, or any combination of the aforementioned could very well be conspiring to use the GME play to bankrupt and pillage every GME shorty (and likely every treasury shorty if there are others besides Citadel) to offset the financial damage done and maintain global public sentiment. The potential fallout for not employing a coordinated strategy here is untenable. You'd be talking a global "max pain" scenario. But if cooperating, only shorties would die, Blackrock and other longs would come out well ahead, retail gets PAID and reinvests/spends, government gets paid and doesn't look UTTERLY incompetent, the dollar remains reserve currency and hyperinflation is averted. And hopefully, legislation and regulation reform follow, but crisis averted! For now..."

​

***" NSCC-801 TA;DR — “If your positions are fucked enough that you’re at risk of losing so much money it'll fuck us all over, we’ll margin call your ass so fast it’ll make your head spin. If two or more of you assholes were that much of a dipshit, we can make you pay OR we can make everyone in the gang have to chip in. They're going to fucking hate that and they’re going to want to prevent the possibility of that happening, so they’ll probably turn on your ass.”


****."it will probably increase leverage constraints on all players, some of which may or may not be embroiled in GME."


*****"Section 5.2.4 (Recovery Corridor and Recovery Phase) outlines the early warning indicators to be used by NSCC to evaluate its options and potentially prepare to enter the “Recovery Phase,” which phase refers to the actions to be taken by NSCC to restore its financial resources and avoid a wind-down of its business. Included in this section are descriptions of potential stress events that could lead to recovery, and several early warning indicators and metrics that NSCC has established to evaluate its options and potentially prepare to enter the Recovery Phase. These indicators, which are referred to in the Recovery Plan as recovery corridor indicators (“Corridor Indicators”),23 are calibrated against NSCC’s financial resources and are designed to give NSCC the ability to replenish financial resources, typically through business as usual (“BAU”) tools applied prior to entering the Recovery Phase."

Extra theories

 The Squeeze will happen. That's it.

Shitedals ultimate goal is getting GameStop to fail, 💎🙌🦍s own the system because 🚀, Feds are forced to contain the damage and Ken is the Sacrifice and change the rules. Blackrock is waiting to buy Dip just like 🦍s. Only question is how much 🦍 want?

Shitedals only other play:  a Silver Squeeze would fuck up the bond market and crashes the dollar fucking all longs up, ignore Silver stay with GME.

Tin Foil Hat Theory: Shitedal crashed the evergiven to crash the US Economy or buy time (more likely I doubt Shitedal could crash it, the Feds would never let it blow up)
