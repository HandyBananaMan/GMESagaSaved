In fact, it's known HF even incorporate this into their investments! The blatant previous shilling to prevent the squeeze and the negative narrative shows that.**\n\n**It would be no surprise when there is a sudden change from the media's current, bullish outlook on GME, to bearish within a week. I believe it to be due to 2 leading possibilities:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. The media are protecting themselves (possible)\n\nI'll keep this short. This is one is obvious. The media have access to exactly the same DD on [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) that we do and in fact, they possibly have just a little more info.\n\nThey (like us) know the market is going to crash harder than the Wall St. pavement and one of the few stocks to come out alive positively afterwards, will be GME.\n\nThey  begin to talk positively about GameStop, so when it moons, they pull the '***WE*** ***TOLD YOU SO. WE CALLED THE BIGGEST TRADE OF THE CENTURY!'***\n\n**They currently do this when the stock plummets, so it's not hard to believe them doing the same when it goes up.**\n\nBoomers will be glued to the articles forever on as they now know *'this is where the best investment advice is'*\n\nThis could also mean that the short HFs don't have enough firepower to control the media and in fact, the longs might just have outbid the position. Maybe a whale is now controlling the narrative?...\n\n***If one media outlet begins to talk positively, they all do. Would you have wanted to have wrote  'GME IS FINISHED', as it moons? While your competitors began reporting it before it squeezed?***\n\nSo why is this only a *'possible'?* Well these media outlets still survived on HF money after the 2008 collapse. It seems they all can say what they want with ZERO repercussions. So I can't be sure they care too much about what they say. But if the company that funds them goes under? Well......\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. The HF are using the media to shill positively, encouraging buyers only to drop the price and shake paper hands (more likely)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the more likely scenario. This is a textbook approach used before. The situation is as follows.\n\n* Create positive sentiment, drawing in buyers from a wider audience and pushing up the price.\n* HF prepare all the shorts and tactics they have in their arsenal\n* When they feel the price has been pushed up enough, they hit the stock as **HARD AS POSSIBLE**, shaking paper hands to snowball the downward momentum\n* They then drink some champagne on the balcony of Wall St to celebrate.\n\nThis is more likely. It's been used time and time again as a tactic for HFs. Shaking paper hands is one of their only ways to prolong the situation, though currently this is a very dangerous tactic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Any upwards momentum might be just a bit too much for them to contain and could spark it to fly upwards. As seen previously, only a small amount of buying pressure is needed to make it jump a few $.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TODAY'S LESSON\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe overriding motive is to talk truthfully about current events to **gain trust.** So when they then report on the stock going down,'**tHeY MuSt bE TeLLiNG tHe TrUth'**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n['tHeY MuSt bE TeLLiNG tHe TrUth'](https://preview.redd.it/0ecy85u21rq61.png?width=3880&format=png&auto=webp&s=603b4e3212d946ee22c4ba5018a172ac82b9b374)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This balanced narrative is usually an act.
