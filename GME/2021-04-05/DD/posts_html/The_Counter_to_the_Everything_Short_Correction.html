<p>Intro </p>
<p>This is a thesis based on Logic, Data, Math, and Facts about 💎🙌🦍s owning the system (not financial advise)</p>
<p>The 🚀 is just Inevitable.</p>
<p>Shitedal only has one out and that isn't happening (💎🙌)</p>
<p>🦍🧠 Smooth 🦍 can learn anything cause 🦍 know nothing</p>

<p>Gonna start with TLDRs</p>
<p>Everyone's fucking the cookie jar, 💎🙌 stopped the game, Feds/Longs are forced to bend the knee/join 💎🙌s and clean up their Laundry mat/printer/naked Shorting and 🦍s own the world</p>
<p>DUH 🤦🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️ new revelation </p>
<p><em>🍗s will create a bull run in Main st and Wall St, 🦍s are the safety net from the crash by paying off debt, all of our families, friends and loved ones debt. Michael Lewis was 1 🦍, 1 🦍 weak, 🦍💪 together that's the most important thing to take away from this 🦍💪 Together</em></p>
<p>Bonus: Fed is forced to pass infrastructure bills to prevent the Bond Market from blowing up, Fed is FORCED to invest in America 🤫 we own the world</p>

In order pull this off the DTCC <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi3xdt/dtcc_new_proposed_rule_change_dtc2021005/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">is stopping naked shorting</a>, the FED allowed the leveraging rules to expire along with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgrx9n/new_dtcc_filing_30_march_recalculating/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">DTCC rule changes****</a> which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhew67/109m_sell_candle_at_close_on_the_dow_jones_to_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">forcing mass deleveraging of Shorts</a> so Naked shorts are forced to close which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhwf5o/apes_proof_there_is_no_volume_other_than_naked/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Shitedal will never do</a> as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">they have no cloths</a> the DTCC is also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgva26/gme_borrow_rates_do_reflect_a_hardtoborrow/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">preventing new shorts from being placed via the Rebate Rates</a>.

<p>Other 🦍 insight</p>
<p>A quote from u/jarvislatteier on how they will liquidate Shitedal completely cause 💎🙌🦍 want blood, they know we won't sell until Shitedals gone.</p>
<p>"If I were to put my tinfoil hat on, the DTCC has rules on forced collection and close out of debt. If the liquidation of that security would cause a shit show the DTCC gets to orchestrate how that spring gets unwound. The shorts must cover that hasn’t changed. But maybe they’re running out the clock till they can cover their ass with the new regulatory revisions.</p>
<p>Warning ⚠️ the following was intentionally being misinterpreted and used as FUD. Pay attention to the most important word “completion”</p>
<p>SEC. 6. (a) Promptly after the Corporation (DTCC) has given notice that it has declined or ceased to act for the Member (HF OR MM), and in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 3, the Net Close Out Position with respect to each CNS Security shall be closed out (whether it be by buying in, selling out or otherwise liquidating the position) by the Corporation;... provided however, if, in the opinion of the Corporation, the close out of a position in a specific security would create a disorderly market in that security, then the completion of such close-out shall be in the discretion of the Corporation.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate THE SHORTS MUST COVER. “The COMPLETION of such close out and disorderly” are the takeaways here. I believe they are running out the clock and setting up Citadel / Melvin / Robinhood to take the fall with no government bailouts. In the last congressional hearing they said they’d let a market maker burn. </p>
<p>Tinfoil hat off. I like the stock."</p>
<p>No Bailout means Shitedal Bleeds dry and then it rolls up into the next organization until all shorts cover and printer goes BRRRRRR <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6u16s/the_lender_of_last_resort_as_foretold_by_dfv/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">lender of last resort</a></p>
<p>🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Squeeze will happen. That's it.</p>
<p>Shitedals ultimate goal is getting GameStop to fail, 💎🙌🦍s own the system because 🚀, Feds are forced to contain the damage and Ken is the Sacrifice plus they are changing the rules (once in an ever deal). Blackrock is waiting to buy crash just like 🦍s. Only question is how many 🍗 do 🦍s want? </p>
<p>Shitedals only other play: A Commodities Squeeze would fuck up the main street/bond market and crashes the dollar fucking all longs up, ignore Silver/Commodities stay with GME.</p>
<p>Tin Foil Hat Theory: Shitedal crashed the evergiven to crash the US Economy or buy time (more likely I doubt Shitedal could crash it, the Feds would never let it blow up, Fed is head hancho)</p>

<p>Referencing quote's Section</p>
<p>*"So here is my thought. I think the DTCC, SEC, Government, all know what is going on. We keep crying for action but I think they already know. Personally, I think they are trying to figure out how to solve this problem without undermining the US Equity Markets. They know it's been corrupt for years but now the average person is just starting to learn about it. They have had the game rigged in their direction since the beginning but this will be the straw that will breaks the camel's back. If they lose creditability, world investors will take their money to other places but they can't do it publicly. They will quietly change the rules and hope this doesn't blow up in their faces.</p>
<p>In reality, people should already be in jail for this because they have/been breaking the law. They don't want that kind of attention because it means the entire system knew and they were complicit. This entire thing could literally bring down the system. So I expect them to protect their own asses first."</p>
<p>**"TLDR: Blackrock, RC Ventures, the Fed, the government, the SEC, the DTCC, or any combination of the aforementioned could very well be conspiring to use the GME play to bankrupt and pillage every GME shorty (and likely every treasury shorty if there are others besides Citadel) to offset the financial damage done and maintain global public sentiment. The potential fallout for not employing a coordinated strategy here is untenable. You'd be talking a global "max pain" scenario. But if cooperating, only shorties would die, Blackrock and other longs would come out well ahead, retail gets PAID and reinvests/spends, government gets paid and doesn't look UTTERLY incompetent, the dollar remains reserve currency and hyperinflation is averted. And hopefully, legislation and regulation reform follow, but crisis averted! For now..."</p>

<p>***" NSCC-801 TA;DR — “If your positions are fucked enough that you’re at risk of losing so much money it'll fuck us all over, we’ll margin call your ass so fast it’ll make your head spin. If two or more of you assholes were that much of a dipshit, we can make you pay OR we can make everyone in the gang have to chip in. They're going to fucking hate that and they’re going to want to prevent the possibility of that happening, so they’ll probably turn on your ass.”</p>
<p>****."it will probably increase leverage constraints on all players, some of which may or may not be embroiled in GME."</p>
<p><strong>*</strong>"Section 5.2.4 (Recovery Corridor and Recovery Phase) outlines the early warning indicators to be used by NSCC to evaluate its options and potentially prepare to enter the “Recovery Phase,” which phase refers to the actions to be taken by NSCC to restore its financial resources and avoid a wind-down of its business. Included in this section are descriptions of potential stress events that could lead to recovery, and several early warning indicators and metrics that NSCC has established to evaluate its options and potentially prepare to enter the Recovery Phase. These indicators, which are referred to in the Recovery Plan as recovery corridor indicators (“Corridor Indicators”),23 are calibrated against NSCC’s financial resources and are designed to give NSCC the ability to replenish financial resources, typically through business as usual (“BAU”) tools applied prior to entering the Recovery Phase."</p>
