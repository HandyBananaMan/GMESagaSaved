If the liquidation of that security would cause a shit show the DTCC gets to orchestrate how that spring gets unwound. The shorts must cover that hasn\u2019t changed. But maybe they\u2019re running out the clock till they can cover their ass with the new regulatory revisions.\n\nWarning \u26a0\ufe0f the following was intentionally being misinterpreted and used as FUD. Pay attention to the most important word \u201ccompletion\u201d\n\nSEC. 6. (a) Promptly after the Corporation (DTCC) has given notice that it has declined or ceased to act for the Member (HF OR MM), and in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 3, the Net Close Out Position with respect to each CNS Security shall be closed out (whether it be by buying in, selling out or otherwise liquidating the position) by the Corporation;... provided however, if, in the opinion of the Corporation, the close out of a position in a specific security would create a disorderly market in that security, then the completion of such close-out shall be in the discretion of the Corporation.\n\nI want to reiterate THE SHORTS MUST COVER. \u201cThe COMPLETION of such close out and disorderly\u201d are the takeaways here. I believe they are running out the clock and setting up Citadel / Melvin / Robinhood to take the fall with no government bailouts. In the last congressional hearing they said they\u2019d let a market maker burn. \n\nTinfoil hat off. I like the stock.\"\n\nNo Bailout means Shitedal Bleeds dry and then it rolls up into the next organization until all shorts cover and printer goes BRRRRRR [lender of last resort](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6u16s/the_lender_of_last_resort_as_foretold_by_dfv/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Squeeze will happen. That's it.\n\nShitedals ultimate goal is getting GameStop to fail, \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8ds own the system because \ud83d\ude80, Feds are forced to contain the damage and Ken is the Sacrifice plus they are changing the rules (once in an ever deal). Blackrock is waiting to buy crash just like \ud83e\udd8ds. Only question is how many \ud83c\udf57 do \ud83e\udd8ds want? \n\nShitedals only other play: A Commodities Squeeze would fuck up the main street/bond market and crashes the dollar fucking all longs up, ignore Silver/Commodities stay with GME.\n\nTin Foil Hat Theory: Shitedal crashed the evergiven to crash the US Economy or buy time (more likely I doubt Shitedal could crash it, the Feds would never let it blow up, Fed is head hancho)\n\n[End Game is DTCC enforcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mir4xo/ever_have_doubts_dtcc_rule_2021005_practically/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n \n\nCredit also goes to [BlackRock a Trillion Dollar Honey Pot](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhd7ba/blackrock_and_a_trillion_dollar_honeypot/) from u/weeknddev for helping my collect my thoughts and evidence together on this, giving me an opposing view leading to the obvious truth \ud83e\udd8d in control \ud83d\ude0f\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nReferencing quote's Section\n\n*\"So here is my thought. I think the DTCC, SEC, Government, all know what is going on. We keep crying for action but I think they already know. Personally, I think they are trying to figure out how to solve this problem without undermining the US Equity Markets. They know it's been corrupt for years but now the average person is just starting to learn about it. They have had the game rigged in their direction since the beginning but this will be the straw that will breaks the camel's back. If they lose creditability, world investors will take their money to other places but they can't do it publicly. They will quietly change the rules and hope this doesn't blow up in their faces.\n\nIn reality, people should already be in jail for this because they have/been breaking the law. They don't want that kind of attention because it means the entire system knew and they were complicit. This entire thing could literally bring down the system. So I expect them to protect their own asses first.\"\n\n**\"TLDR: Blackrock, RC Ventures, the Fed, the government, the SEC, the DTCC, or any combination of the aforementioned could very well be conspiring to use the GME play to bankrupt and pillage every GME shorty (and likely every treasury shorty if there are others besides Citadel) to offset the financial damage done and maintain global public sentiment. The potential fallout for not employing a coordinated strategy here is untenable. You'd be talking a global \"max pain\" scenario. But if cooperating, only shorties would die, Blackrock and other longs would come out well ahead, retail gets PAID and reinvests/spends, government gets paid and doesn't look UTTERLY incompetent, the dollar remains reserve currency and hyperinflation is averted. And hopefully, legislation and regulation reform follow, but crisis averted!

Included in this section are descriptions of potential stress events that could lead to recovery, and several early warning indicators and metrics that NSCC has established to evaluate its options and potentially prepare to enter the Recovery Phase. These indicators, which are referred to in the Recovery Plan as recovery corridor indicators (\u201cCorridor Indicators\u201d),23 are calibrated against NSCC\u2019s financial resources and are designed to give NSCC the ability to replenish financial resources, typically through business as usual (\u201cBAU\u201d) tools applied prior to entering the Recovery Phase.\"\n\n\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\ud83c\udf57\n\n[Part 2: World War 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mm959z/world_war_3_longs_vs_shorts/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",
