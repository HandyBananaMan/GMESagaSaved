Good Evening Apes,

Hope all of you are getting settled in nicely here in our new sanctuary. I remind you that you all turn this place from house into a home. Let's get right into it.

Many of you may know me from my previous posts depicting the Deep ITM calls being bought out of the PHLX exchange. Interestingly enough, for the first time since this whole thing started, no large trades of Deep ITM calls were made.

![GME Biggest Trades 4-5-2021](https://preview.redd.it/53s8h7u46hr61.jpg?width=1223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af04c21756471feb558c9482e70c13fe31378c2a)

A smart ape name [u/glide\_si](https://www.reddit.com/u/glide_si/) suggested that these large trades were often seen back to back with another duplicate trade suggesting these calls were being rapidly bought and sold. We speculated that this was one way the shorts were hiding their FTD's. With the recent addition of DTCC rule that from my understanding is preventing this process from happening (creation of synthetic shares) have we finally seen the end of this massive Deep ITM call buying. Hard to know what is to come as a result of this but my gut tells me the end is near.

TL;DR: NEW DTCC RULES PREVENT HEDGEFUNDS FROM COVERING UP FTD'S WITH DEEP ITM CALLS

Red crayons taste the best; change my mind.
