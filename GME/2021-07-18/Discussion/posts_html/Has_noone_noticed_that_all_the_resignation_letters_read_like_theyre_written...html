<p>(Edit 2 - realistically, everyone should leave super stonk and go anywhere else.  The only posts there should be telling others to leave.  You have all seen the screenshots, hopefully.  The migration from gme to SS was coordinated and manipulated.  We were fucking corraled there, and it should piss all of you off.  That place has been tainted enemy territory from the beginning.)</p>
<p>Havent you noticed?  Go take a look at how RCQ talks in those screenshots, and then compare it to her resignation letter.  Isnt it like two different people?</p>
<p>What about all the other mods who quit, even though some of them we hardly knew were around.  Dont they seem to all effect the same tone? </p>
<p>Why does ButtFarm69s post have the same formatting and tone as all of Renshills posts?</p>
<p>Guys.. that whole fucking sub is compromised.  Likely always has been.  Theyre talking about waiting for new mods, but i guarantee those mods are carbon copies of the ones who left.   If not in tone, they will be in their actions and deception.</p>
<p>And i guarantee when you come across this post (if you do), its been downvoted to oblivion and lost in the shuffle.</p>
<p>EDIt - thanks to another ape... PSA - Didnt ButtFarm69 only get popular because he had a post of his featured on MarketWatch?  And that somehow qualifies him to be a mod?  And that isn't suspicious at all?<br />
We are being played.  You apes need to wake up and pay attention.</p>
