<p>A GME/Ethereum Crash Course</p>
<p>Go to nft.gamestop.com </p>
<p>Scroll down to below the graphic and click on "Copy"</p>
<p>That is an address on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Go to etherscan.io</p>
<p>Paste the Ethereum address into the search bar and hit enter. </p>
<p>BEHOLD</p>
<p>GameStop is on Ethereum!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>THIS IS BIG</p>
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page and take a look at the transaction history.</p>
<p>THERE ARE MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS WITH COINBASE.  THIS IS BIG.</p>
<p>If you don't know, Coinbase is an American cryptocurrency exchange and a big player in the cryptocurrency world. </p>
<p>They are up to something for sure.</p>
<p>My guess would be planning for an ICO.</p>
<p>An ICO is an Initial Coin Offering.  It's similar to an IPO (initial public offering) for stonks.</p>
<p>Typically, with an ICO, a certain amount of "coins" or another type of blockchain asset is released to the public and a market is created for the new digital asset.  </p>
<p>(There can be other methods of coin releases because Ethereum smart contracts can be programmed in any way, but I'm giving you a basic example here.) </p>
<p>I'm no crypto expert, but I've been following the space for a number of years.</p>
<p>My speculation here is that GameStop is in partnership with Coinbase in preparation for an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of some sort. </p>
<p>THIS IS HUGE ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
