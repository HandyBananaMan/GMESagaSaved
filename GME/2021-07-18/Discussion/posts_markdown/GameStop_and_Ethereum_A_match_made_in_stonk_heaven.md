A GME/Ethereum Crash Course


Go to nft.gamestop.com 

Scroll down to below the graphic and click on "Copy"

That is an address on the Ethereum blockchain.

Go to etherscan.io

Paste the Ethereum address into the search bar and hit enter. 

BEHOLD

GameStop is on Ethereum!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

THIS IS BIG

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and take a look at the transaction history.

THERE ARE MULTIPLE TRANSACTIONS WITH COINBASE.  THIS IS BIG.

If you don't know, Coinbase is an American cryptocurrency exchange and a big player in the cryptocurrency world. 

They are up to something for sure.

My guess would be planning for an ICO.

An ICO is an Initial Coin Offering.  It's similar to an IPO (initial public offering) for stonks.

Typically, with an ICO, a certain amount of "coins" or another type of blockchain asset is released to the public and a market is created for the new digital asset.  

(There can be other methods of coin releases because Ethereum smart contracts can be programmed in any way, but I'm giving you a basic example here.) 

I'm no crypto expert, but I've been following the space for a number of years.

My speculation here is that GameStop is in partnership with Coinbase in preparation for an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of some sort. 

THIS IS HUGE ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
