Hello fellow apes,

With all the ridiculousness that transpired on the various GME subreddits these last few days, I've had one burning question that I can't seem to find answers to:

Why is it that whenever Point72 or Susquehanna are brought up, they are either completely ignored or removed? I remember reading posts indicating that Point72 and Susquehanna are bigger culprits in GME than even Citadel, yet we NEVER pay any attention to them. I've been wondering- is this FUD? Is Point72 and Susquehanna paying shills to continue to throw Citadel under the bus? Did the mods that were recently removed paid by either of these players to continue to trash Citadel?

Why have there been no investigations into either of these companies, or their C-suite team of execs? Why does no one post pics of these players? Why does no one go to their offices and make vids? 

I also don't buy the reasoning that it's just easier to focus on Citadel. We are making Kenny the scapegoat for everything, while letting everyone off the hook. 

It seems very sus that it's always just Citadel.
