#Title: Remember 3 weeks ago today when $G M E was trading at over $450 and they simply banned and blocked retail from buying securities nosediving the price of the stock costing retail traders billions of dollars proving this "free market" clown system called the stock market is rigged against us?

They straight up robbed us in broad fucking daylight with the police watching and the world recording it on their cell phones...If there's anyone left in any position of power that can actually do anything about this broken ass system NOW IS THE FUCKING TIME and these motherfuckers need to be placed in prison over this. (good luck defending yourself at the circus show today [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/))

The thesis on GME was 100% correct ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today\_interactive\_brokers\_ceo\_admits\_that\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/)) and THAT is what we were trading on, it was demonstrably working and they simply changed the rules of the game by pulling the rug out from under to save their GREEDY market manipulating two-faced assholes...multiple brokerages convinced into stopping the purchase of a security (SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK) effectively killed the upward momentum of the stock price saving HF's BILLIONS which is absolutely FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.

WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE JOURNALISTS REPORTING ON THIS?

If these motherfuckers don't fix this, retail alongside the rest of the world that invests in the American stock market should completely ditch the market seeing as it's FULLY CORRUPT and move intoC R Y P T O, where the game isn't rigged against us.  


EDIT: Also posted this on WSB and post REMOVED when it made it to the top after 45 min - WHY? I was led to believe u/zjz and crew were back in control.
