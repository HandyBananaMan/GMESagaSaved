<p>"Investors from all walks of life were significantly damaged by the price manipulation incited by Keith Gill and his unsuspecting followers who hung on his every word. We are focused on what MML and Massachusetts Mutual knew about Keith Gill's activities," said Steve Berman, Hagens Berman managing partner. "Trades and social media of his magnitude does not go unnoticed."</p>
<p>Lead Plaintiff Process: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased GME securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff. If you wish to serve as Lead Plaintiff for the Class, you must file a motion with the Court no later than April 19, 2021, which is the first business day on which the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts is open that is 60 days after the publication date of February 16, 2021. Any member of the proposed Class may move the Court to serve as Lead Plaintiff through counsel of their choice. Members may also choose to do nothing and remain part of the proposed Class.</p>
