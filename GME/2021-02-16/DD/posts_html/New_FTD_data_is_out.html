<p>The GME Failure to Deliver data from the second half of January is out!  It's about what you'd expect:</p>
<p>1/15    892,653</p>
<p>1/19    1,498,576</p>
<p>1/20    1,007,562</p>
<p>1/21    1,438,994</p>
<p>1/22    273,600</p>
<p>1/25    275,113</p>
<p>1/26    2,099,572</p>
<p>1/27    1,972,862</p>
<p>1/28    1,032,986</p>
<p>1/29    138,179</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Oh, wow!  That is a huge number of FTDs!!  But I guess they covered, because it jumps down so much at 1/29, right?  Well, in addition to potentially covering that number by shorting more, look at our friendly GME heavy ETF (XRT):</p>
<p>1/15    10,187</p>
<p>1/19    9,134</p>
<p>1/20    1,144</p>
<p>1/21    17,703</p>
<p>1/22    23,125</p>
<p>1/25    112,536</p>
<p>1/26    127,661</p>
<p>1/27    80,112</p>
<p>1/28    385,651</p>
<p>1/29    2,218,348</p>
<p>In two weeks XRT goes from having about 10,000 FTDs to OVER TWO MILLION.  That is fucking enormous.  This shit is huge, and they are willing to do anything to try and get away with it.  This is not financial advice--I'm just a monkey counting bananas promised versus bananas given.</p>

<p>disclosure: I own GME shares, and I plan to hold.</p>
