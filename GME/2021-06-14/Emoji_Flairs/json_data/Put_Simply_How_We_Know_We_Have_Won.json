    "selftext": "So they dropped the price to 226. This may feel unpleasant and FUD-y to some, but it is still far higher than it was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nIf they *could*\u00a0drop the price to less than that they *would.*\u00a0But they *can't.*\u00a0So they *don't.*\u00a0This is it. This is the ultimate realization. This is all they can do otherwise they wouldn't be here. They are fucked.\n\nThey are making loud scary noises and appear all menacing with their projections in the media but that's all they are able to do. If a magic button showed up and they could press it and make the cost go back to 2$, do you think they wouldn't have smashed it already? They. Are. Fucked.",
