Honestly all I really want to do is pay off my house and all other debt, quit my fucking job, and hang out with my family like everyday, maybe even homeschool my kids who are 3 and 5. Public schools are fucking dumpster fires and they ain’t getting any better.

Full Disclosure: I’m still buying a Lambo and the wife okay’d it.
