Edit: our own mod u/creakfast posted [a piece on this on SS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndf4d2/why_i_think_wardenelite_has_been_bought_out/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), maybe give it 🦍💕 if you agree.

We've had alot of posts and outrage on the FUD Warden was spreading on Superstonks via his latest regular post, in an effort to show clarity on the fall out i will present links of informations and an overall TLDR 

First the [TLDR: Warden was spreading FUD via price anchoring and pushing for Market sells](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndebg1/this_comment_needs_to_be_seen_and_discussed_in/gya8x8b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) 🦍s know 🦍s name the price and Limit Sells are the way

[Another TLDR with pics of evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndis14/you_finally_exposed_yourself_beyond_a_reasonable/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) this was [pulled down from SS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndezcl/you_finally_exposed_yourself_beyond_a_reasonable/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) which is worrysome.

This is [Wardens Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndc1rc/selling_on_the_way_down_a_definitive_dd_on/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (its been deleted, but the comments give more context)



The Mod team from my perspective took swift action and dealt with the problem on Superstonks (im very proud 😁, minus the questionable above censorship, you need to make your own mind up on that 🦍) [u/redchessqueen99 made a statement here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndh0s9/wardenelite_has_resigned/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Warden "resignes" here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndg6oi/i_will_be_stepping_down_from_being_a_mod/gyahiny/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Pinkcatsonacid was first on the screen then Stonku2 and then Redchessqueen99, for those wondering which mods first handled the situation. (From what i saw)

I personally take big fall outs as another sign (ontop of our quality DDs) that we are getting closer to the End Game, as the pressure ramps up the shills will slip and non 🦍 incentives will become obvious (as the 🚀 outweighs everything) as always you be you beautiful 🦍s 😁 🦍💕🦍 and 🦍💪 Together and most importantly 💎🙌 and do your own Due Diligence 

Please don't harass, Warden may not be 🦍, but 🦍s don't attack humans they Meme them out of existence.

Another side note for GME because of the constant Manipulation TA is not something i consider even remotely relaible, im waiting for the short position to become untenable or for the DTCC/SEC Margin call via liquidity test or maybe a whistleblower with a smoking gun 🔫

Adding notable comments below

Lastly i know the sell on the way down was pushed heavily by Warden [so consider this 🦍s words](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyb5gab?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

[This is a good explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gybsp26?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) on why 🦍s use limit orders

Tho I don't agree with TA when it comes to GME, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyc6qb3?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) makes an excellent point an 🦍 attacking and undermining others 🦍s reaserch without attempting to add anything or correct mistakes is not an 🦍 to me

[This was a cross post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndtmhe/why_did_redchessqueen_allow_warden_to_dox_someone/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) i pulled from the sub but I felt it would do good adding to the information pile, [another one via a comment drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gydbh25?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) the dates Is in international format and another piece of ![evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyenrw4?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) showing he's changing his advise which would hurt 🦍s during MOASS.

After seeing evidence of shilling, doxing, and general toxic behavior from Warden i have banned him from r/gme, if anyone has counter-evidence then what i provided please let me know.
