(From what i saw)\n\nI personally take big fall outs as another sign (ontop of our quality DDs) that we are getting closer to the End Game, as the pressure ramps up the shills will slip and non \ud83e\udd8d incentives will become obvious (as the \ud83d\ude80 outweighs everything) as always you be you beautiful \ud83e\udd8ds \ud83d\ude01 \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd8d and \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa Together and most importantly \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c and do your own Due Diligence \n\nPlease don't harass, Warden may not be \ud83e\udd8d, but \ud83e\udd8ds don't attack humans they Meme them out of existence.\n\nAnother side note for GME because of the constant Manipulation TA is not something i consider even remotely relaible, im waiting for the short position to become untenable or for the DTCC/SEC Margin call via liquidity test or maybe a whistleblower with a smoking gun \ud83d\udd2b\n\nAdding notable comments below\n\nLastly i know the sell on the way down was pushed heavily by Warden [so consider this \ud83e\udd8ds words](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyb5gab?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)\n\n[This is a good explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gybsp26?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) on why \ud83e\udd8ds use limit orders\n\nTho I don't agree with TA when it comes to GME, [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyc6qb3?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) makes an excellent point an \ud83e\udd8d attacking and undermining others \ud83e\udd8ds reaserch without attempting to add anything or correct mistakes is not an \ud83e\udd8d to me\n\n[This was a cross post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndtmhe/why_did_redchessqueen_allow_warden_to_dox_someone/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) i pulled from the sub but I felt it would do good adding to the information pile, [another one via a comment drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gydbh25?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) the dates Is in international format and another piece of [evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ndj6k3/concerning_wardens_fall_out/gyenrw4?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) showing he's changing his advise which would hurt \ud83e\udd8ds during MOASS.\n\nAfter seeing evidence of shilling, doxing, and general toxic behavior from Warden i have banned him from r/gme, if anyone has counter-evidence then what i provided please let me know.",
