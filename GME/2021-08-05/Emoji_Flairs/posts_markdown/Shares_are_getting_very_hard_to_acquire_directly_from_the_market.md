Helped bring 2 new apes into the fold today and yesterday. 

1st new ape bought 10 shares, took 4 transactions to complete the buy of those 10 shares.

2nd new ape, my girl, just bought 25 shares, took 9 transactions to complete the buy. 

This tells me a lot about how hard these shares are becoming to acquire.

I've gotten both of their accts set up through TDA and went through and enabled direct routing through Nasdaq. 

I've never ever had to go through multiple transactions to buy such small amounts of shares!

We are getting very close I believe, either way, Ill hold till the fkn wheels fall of if needs be!

Cheers!
