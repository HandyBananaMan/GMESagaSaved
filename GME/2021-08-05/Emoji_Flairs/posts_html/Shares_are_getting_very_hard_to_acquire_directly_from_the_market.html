<p>Helped bring 2 new apes into the fold today and yesterday. </p>
<p>1st new ape bought 10 shares, took 4 transactions to complete the buy of those 10 shares.</p>
<p>2nd new ape, my girl, just bought 25 shares, took 9 transactions to complete the buy. </p>
<p>This tells me a lot about how hard these shares are becoming to acquire.</p>
<p>I've gotten both of their accts set up through TDA and went through and enabled direct routing through Nasdaq. </p>
<p>I've never ever had to go through multiple transactions to buy such small amounts of shares!</p>
<p>We are getting very close I believe, either way, Ill hold till the fkn wheels fall of if needs be!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
