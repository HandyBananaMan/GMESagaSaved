<p>So if ken holds a large short position in AMC, he may loose a shit ton of cash if it goes. </p>
<p>It might mean the call to cover for gme is soon aswell? </p>
<p>Remember margin call occurs when the amount of capital held is not sufficient. Therefore if he looses on AMC it will be better for us!</p>
