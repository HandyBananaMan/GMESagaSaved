I can't really support this with any data right now,.But there might be a big orchestrated sell off of everything, to crash the entire market. In hopes to make people sell this stock, and not (really) collapse the entire market.Whatever you do hold on to GME. They need it so bad they're willing to do everything, not to take a hit on the chin.

edit: Wise words of u/613Flyer in the comments: "The message needs to be shared and enforced that when the market starts crashing it means that MOASS is starting."

To add to that. I kinda see GME as an all market Hedge!

It's just my retarded unsupported opinion, and not advice. Looking for fellow apes for a crayon fondue.
