<p>GME is overly shorted and the hedgies MUST buy back their positions. Not to mention that the company itself is set to soon become the “Amazon of Gaming”. </p>
<p>Hold this stock through thick and thin until your account value looks like a phone number. Never sell. Hold hold hold until it reaches obscene amounts.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of DD you can read on this sub and r/superstonk to get educated on what’s going on.</p>
<p>I freaking love you. Buy and hold.</p>
