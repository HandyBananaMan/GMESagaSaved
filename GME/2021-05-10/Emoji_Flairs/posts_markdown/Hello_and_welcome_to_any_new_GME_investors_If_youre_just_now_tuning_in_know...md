GME is overly shorted and the hedgies MUST buy back their positions. Not to mention that the company itself is set to soon become the “Amazon of Gaming”. 

Hold this stock through thick and thin until your account value looks like a phone number. Never sell. Hold hold hold until it reaches obscene amounts.

There’s plenty of DD you can read on this sub and r/superstonk to get educated on what’s going on.

I freaking love you. Buy and hold.
