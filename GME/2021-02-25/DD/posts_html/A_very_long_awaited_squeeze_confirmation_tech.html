<p>Someone in the discussion thread told me to post this as DD. Here goes:</p>
<p>Basically there is a huuuge (... cataclysmic) 3m:1d MACD buy signal. I’ve been essentially screaming about it like an apocalypse bellringer--probably at all of you--since it started reverting 10 mkt days ago.</p>
<h1>And ... ... ... today it happened 🚀🚀</h1>
<p><img alt="PIC" src="https://imgur.com/gallery/sDm6998" /> - Here's my argument about why this is still relevant (if you still don't think so see TL;DR):</p>
<p>MACD uses reversion to the mean and momentum among other things so it would, in theory, imply to what intensity it is going to reverse and it <strong>will</strong> (not may) do so way more violently. All shorts did by laddering it down was build up immense pressure <em>on top o</em>f pre-existing pressure. I swear to you I watched almost every minute of that histogram. I watched those grey bars build and I watched the signal and MACD line live. They're stomping on it as hard as they can but they're really essentially jumping on a shot gun shell till eventually ... ... ...</p>
<p>See <strong>if every paper hand could physically dip their hands in the GME charts right now, the pressure would make them come out diamonds</strong>.  The MACD does and has shown this and can be a good thing to refer to, to reassure yourself that the squeeze hasn't squoze at $x xx or $ x xxx oooorrr $xx xxx or even $xxx xxx (?). This technical still holds truth and accuracy IMO. Use at your own discretion. I may be a r—tard (apparently that word is banned now?) but boy do I love my indicators. I've also been in some much smaller scale/longer term squeeze plays ($NVAX from spring to summer 2020) and the long term MACD gave me a near perfect exit.</p>
<p><strong>You guys probably want to know what’s even more exciting about this?</strong> Well let me tell you. People say the MACD is often preceding in predicting uptrends especially in longer time frame charts. A good check to verify if it’s lagging/synchronized/or early on any ticker is to compare price action to previous convergences and divergences. <strong>Good thing we have the January spike to use as reference</strong> ... and guess what??? It was early to the party the first time by a long shot. If it hadn't been forced by shorts (MACD also shows early force attempts on the red MACD line) it would have kept on at full tilt. You can see it was only positive by 0.42 in the picture. The most it can move i've seen (even yesterday) is 4-5 points. Usually it's less than 1-2/day. The fun doesn't start till 15+.</p>
<p>All this simply means that the actual trend won’t figuratively be taking full throttle for another few days even though we’ve already gapped up over 100% and will continue to (so it might look like it has tomorrow ... but it didn't start. Maybe Monday? No ... it probably hasn't) 🚀. Based on historic behaviour and forward forecasting of the MACD, I’m predicting the histogram will only pick up notably enough to assume a squeeze ‘base’ of sorts (not a plateau just a checkpoint) when the price reaches <strong>$300-400</strong>. To put this into perspective, the base when the histogram spiked in January--ie, compared to the same MACD was <strong>$40-80</strong>).</p>
<p>This would confirm one of my favourite DDs right now I saw in the God Tier by u/KitrosReddit:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls0wmd/if_gamestop_hits_800_before_226_we_will_trigger/">If GameStop hits 800 before 2/26 we will trigger the Mother of All Short Squeezes, read up.</a></p>
<p>So by the time we hit that 'base' of sorts, that post stipulates that a domino of gamma squeezes will have triggered which <strong>I personally see as a free ticket to $800+-</strong></p>
<p>And I can't help but think why in all heck would you have a limit order set below that? Not you diamond hands reading this though. Carry on ... I'll see you at $69 420.</p>
<h1>Couple things</h1>
<p>A common misconception that came up in the discussion thread that I feel I should add (and is probably also mentioned in that post): <strong>Contracts themselves don't have to expire necessarily to even spark the gamma squeezes in succession. It's often a result of so many long contracts being bought that brokers, sometimes contract writers, and even contract holders writing covered calls are buying shares to hedge.</strong> A lot of people are saying its unhedged shares being bought at expiration by brokers; that does positively affect price but isn't the whole schtick; I would argue that isn't a gamma squeeze at all. <em>Extra volume on contracts is gravy for us smoothed-brained shareholders.</em></p>
<p>Last thing that came up in the discussion I want to toss in I've heard all over the thread: "it can only happen if shorts play by the rules" ... My opinion on this is honestly ... would you get a speeding ticket and then pass the cop who just gave you the ticket at 150MPH? I know HFs and Citadel break 10 financial laws each day before breakfast but remember; the public eye is on them. If they had any aces up their sleeve they wouldn't have (... they have already)  lost control in the first place. It gapped from $45 to $200 AH in less than 3h.. I think congress was pretty aggressive and there's already a second hearing date with the SEC present. Citadel has a terrible (TERRRRRRIBLE) track record. Do I think they're going to keep doing shady stuff? Yes. Illegal stuff? Probably. <strong>At this point I don't see that affecting the squeeze whatsoever.</strong> I see sore losers running out of steam.</p>
<p>And to boot Robinhood has way less credibility than they did 4 weeks ago; a lot of people left. Don't take your skeptical glasses off by any means but I truly believe that this time shorts won’t be able to snuff it out because ...</p>
<p><strong>Robinhood literally became the broker equivalent of Enron overnight</strong> and lost all their privileges to f—ck us over when they lost over half of their customer base. 💎👐🏻</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR --</strong> The squeeze won't have truly started at $200 ... $300 ... probably $800+-. Moving average convergence divergence helps investors understand when the stock starts going from neeeeeoooooow to brrrrrrrrrrrrrr and from brrrrrrrrrrrr to neeeeeeeeoooooooowww to a certain degree of accuracy and is in fact still relevant to GME even though it's DeTaChED fRom FuNdAmEnTalS (which I don't even agree with--not only because Cohen is a mad lad but) because we do have fundamentals in a squeeze play just because the play itself is a squeeze. Such as, true SI % estimates with XRT and other ETFs, short ladder attacks suppressing inevitable reversion to the mean, and the ever so shrinking float.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR of the TL;DR</strong> -- if any of you believe this is going to 10k I don't think we should be sounding alarms like Melvin/Citadel's HQ are on fire until we're at least pushing $1000</p>
<p>Take it all with a grain of salt I just really like this stock 🌕🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>

<p>Edit: tpyos</p>
<p>Edit 2: some stuff didn't bold for some reason ** **</p>
<p>Edit 3: one more tpyo</p>
<p>Edit 4: I'm tired ... when I close my eyes I see candlesticks ... I'm going to go to bed. Thank you all for the love!</p>
<p>Edit 5: Guess who's still up? I didn't expect this much to keep up with. It's awesome. Two things I've pasted from comments for visibility:</p>
<p>a) You can't/shouldn't use MACD to look for an exit point. Maybe (maybe) ... you can in conjunction with other indicators and fundamental points. If you look at the Jan spike in the pic, you see the MACD line twitches right once or twice. That's shorts kicking it down only when they can till eventually a panic happened ... not really panic they just doubled down (but it did keep upwards despite that blip or two).  Just use it (if at all) as affirmation that the squeeze still has lots of squoze left in it</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR to a) -- if you act on MACD alone and react to everything that looks like it could be a convergence/divergence on this indicator you're probably maybe sort of going to get out early</strong>.</p>
<p>b) I used the 3 month time frame because with my broker (probably the same with yours) every time frame past a month doesn't show sticks more precise than 1 day. So 6 month is the same 1d sticks. 1m:1d also the same MACD. It's just the best picture of the trend available. 1m cuts off the first spike.</p>
<p>Last last last thing because I guess it wasn't clear. Without checking, I'm positive 9/10 indicators will be blown out of the water when the squeeze itself picks up full tilt. <strong>I'll personally be watching price almost exclusively</strong> and trying to snipe a limit in. If you aren't comfortable with an indicator be warned.</p>
<p>(elaboration from what I said up there \^\^)</p>
<p>I'm still glad this info is out there! Thanks again!</p>
