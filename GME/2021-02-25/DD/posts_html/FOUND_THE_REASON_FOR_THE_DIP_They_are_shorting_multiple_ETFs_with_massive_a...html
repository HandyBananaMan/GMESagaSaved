<p><strong>EDIT (9:51AM): THEY ARE SHORTING $GME VIA 63(!) DIFFERENT ETFS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY</strong>! (<a href="https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme">https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme</a>;  <a href="https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME">https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME</a>)</p>
<p>EDIT 3: I actually predicted this in my post from yesterday ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrijdv/my_theory_for_todays_market_close_get_ready_for_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrijdv/my_theory_for_todays_market_close_get_ready_for_a/</a> ) Take a look at Edit4.</p>
<p>EDIT4: Someone stole my post on WSB and isn't even crediting me. I DON'T MIND CROSSPOSTS, THEY HELP EVERYONE AND BRING EXPOSURE TO THE ISSUE. BUT DON'T STEAL AND NOT CREDIT ME! Just wanted to vent because it's actually blowing up on WSB, but he isn't even updating the data, so it's pretty useless.</p>
<p>~~EDIT5: MY DD HAD 30,000 UPVOTES ON WSB BEFORE IT GOT REMOVED. STILL COMPROMISED...~~  The Post is now back up, but there was no reason for it to be removed in the first place.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT EDIT(5)(10:41AM):  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 10 % AND THE WHOLE MARKET IS TAKING DIPS RIGHT NOW. That's exactly what happened back in January in the first Gamma Squeeze. Good sign!</p>
<p>EDIT6:  <strong>XRT GME holdings increased from 3% testerday to 9% today. XRT IS ALMOST 200 % SHORT SOLD ATM</strong> (<a href="https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/">https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/</a>)</p>
<p>EDIT7(12:21AM): CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 16 % AND THE WHOLE MARKET IS TAKING DIPS RIGHT NOW. That's exactly what happened back in January in the first Gamma Squeeze. Good sign!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT8(1:43PM): CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 25 %!!!!! (That's a huge indication!) Also: TECH Stocks are in deep red again. Propably Hedgefunds sellings other assets to prepare for a huge buy of GME.</strong></p>
<p>EDIT9(2:17PM): <strong>Because lots of people ask me for a prediction for today, here is what I think is gonna happen:</strong> There are a lot of options in between $135 and $250 (Around 70,000). I think it's still part of my options chain prediction from yesterday. Institution (the ones on Our side) are gonna try to drive up the price in about 45 minutes from now on (3PM EST). Take into consideration, that on our way up there are gonna be about 2 - 3 trading halts. If we close above $200 there are about 60.000 options becoming ITM. That means, over 6,000,000 shares could be bought in an instant, if those options are gonna be exercised. So the $200 mark is the one that Institutions want to close above in order for the gamma squeeze to happen in full extent tomorrow. <strong>My prediction is: We close between $200 and $220 with a sudden spike in price and volume, starting at around 3PM EST.</strong> This is just my thought, no financial advice.</p>
<p>EDIT10(2:45PM): I added up all of the shorts at the opening! 1<strong>8,363,000 (18 Million, yes!) Shares were sold short at the beginning of the market.</strong> The fact that we are still running up high shows, that Hedgies are fuk.</p>
<p>EDIT11(3:30PM): <strong>CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 40 %!</strong></p>
<p>EDIT12: Seems like my predictions was right! (If you turn the graph upside down). I am analyzing the data after the market closes to see if there is a reason for that huge drop-off. You win some you lose some. See y'all tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>FINAL EDIT: WHY WAS MY PREDICTION OFF TODAY?</strong> I tought Hedgies are about to give up. But no. These Fuckers just shorted over 33,000,000 more shares. They are in really deep shit, just to survive some more weeks. I knew they were retarded, but this is a level of retardation, that no one could've forseen.

<p>Also: <strong>They borrowed 1,500,000</strong> $GME Shares <strong>to short yesterday (</strong><img alt="**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**" src="https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME" /><strong>)</strong>, but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: Millions of shares being sold short today, trying to get people to panic sell. DATA IS FROM 9:45AM AND I AM TRYING TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE.</p>
