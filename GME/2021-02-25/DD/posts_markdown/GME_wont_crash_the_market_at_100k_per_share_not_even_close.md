The current float (i.e. market tradeable shares) of GME is 45.05M shares [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME). Let's assume a theoretical maximum short interest of 100% (yes, I know it could be higher due to naked shorting) and let's also assume the shorts will have to cover at a median price of $100K, that would be a total of $4.5T (float x median price). To put that number into perspective, the market cap of just the S&P 500 is $31.3T [source](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_market_cap). As a percentage we are talking <15%. Furthermore, the S&P 500 is just one market. If we take the sum of the market caps for the three major US markets (DOW, NASDAQ, S&P) we have a total market cap of $8.2T [source](https://finasko.com/dow-jones-stocks/) + $17.9T [source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/market-capitalization/nasdaq_100?p=1) + $31.3T = $57.4T. If we use this as our denominator, we now have a miniscule percentage of 7.8%. Call me crazy, but I don't think a dip in the total market cap of the US economy of 7.8% will cause a crash.

TLDR - A short squeeze of GME to $100k and beyond won't crash US markets based purely on capital requirements. Your tendies will be safe when we land on the moon. See you in Valhalla.
