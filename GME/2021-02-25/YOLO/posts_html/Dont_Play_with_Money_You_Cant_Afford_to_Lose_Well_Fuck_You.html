<p>I'm a black woman in America. This is my only chance to make things right for my black children's futures. If these fuckers keep playing these games, I sure as hell will start playing with money I can't afford to lose.</p>
<p>I'd rather lose my home because whether it is my money going towards my mortgage or my money going towards this class war, either way my money gets funneled to them anyway.</p>
<p>We are fucking with the 1% of the 1%. They chose to lose $881 Million Dollars yesterday just to avoid making shit right.</p>
<p>Fuck you if you think my black American woman ass should lose my dignity without fucking sacrificing my shit. My ancestors fucking suffered more than just fucking lights off and moving in with friends.</p>
<p>I don’t know about y'all, but this is war for me and I'm not going to let my kids live out the same racist, classist shit show this country has been for centuries without giving all I got.</p>
<p>I only live once.</p>
<p>Edit:
OMG, ALL THIS LOVE. I am bawling in tears of gratitude and strength knowing I am not alone and never will be.</p>
<p>Thank you All, I am so Blessed. 🙏🏾🙏🏾</p>
<p>💗💗💗Stronger Together💗💗💗</p>
