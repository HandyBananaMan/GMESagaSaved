I've seen several posts and comments saying something to the tune of "selling at 170 and buying back in at 140".

This literally defeats the point of all the holding you've been doing for the past month or more. Everytime you sell for those quick profits, you give them shares to cover with for pennies of their worth. Not to mention you are treading dangerous waters with the day trading rules. 

If you are a believer in the squeeze then stop doing this. 

Not financial advice, just a man who's hands have been compressed at 25,000 lbs per square inch and heated to approximately 2500°F.

Edit: hi Andrew

Edit 2: since there seems to be confusion on the messaging here --

If you need to (or even want to) pull out to take some profits that's fine and no one is shaming. I'm speaking to a select group who wants the squeeze to happen but also wants to take these small profits, and why that goes against your best interest. That is all. Get some rest everyone and let's see what tomorrow HOLDs for us. 🦍🦧🦍🦧💎👐
