Everytime you sell for those quick profits, you give them shares to cover with for pennies of their worth. Not to mention you are treading dangerous waters with the day trading rules. \n\nIf you are a believer in the squeeze then stop doing this. \n\nNot financial advice, just a man who's hands have been compressed at 25,000 lbs per square inch and heated to approximately 2500\u00b0F.\n\nEdit: hi Andrew\n\nEdit 2: since there seems to be confusion on the messaging here --\n\nIf you need to (or even want to) pull out to take some profits that's fine and no one is shaming. I'm speaking to a select group who wants the squeeze to happen but also wants to take these small profits, and why that goes against your best interest. That is all. Get some rest everyone and let's see what tomorrow HOLDs for us. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50",
