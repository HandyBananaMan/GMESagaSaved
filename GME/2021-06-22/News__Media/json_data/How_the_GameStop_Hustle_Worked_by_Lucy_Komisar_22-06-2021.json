    "selftext": " I just came across this good article by Lucy Komisar:\n\n# How the GameStop Hustle Worked\n\nHow hedge funds and brokers have manipulated the market.\n\n \n\n\"I have [written previously for the *Prospect*](https://prospect.org/power/gamestop-mess-exposes-the-naked-short-selling-scam/) about the frenzy over GameStop (GME), the video game and electronics company. By now, you know the story. Millions of retail investors made the stock soar by over 1,000 percent in January 2021. This brought disaster upon a handful of hedge funds that had bet on GameStop\u2019s stock to drop. According to [Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-funds-squeeze-sachs-biggest-short-goldman-2021-2-1030026939), one analyst estimated losses in February of roughly $19 billion. The hedge fund Melvin Capital reportedly closed out its position after taking a drubbing of 51 percent. Another fund, Maplelane, lost 40 percent.\n\nThe rally eventually subsided, and the stock fell, though it remains well above its original price. But as retail investors looked into the details in the aftermath, they found telltale signs of a common yet egregious trading fraud by major brokers and hedge funds, which evaded what could have been far bigger losses. What happened around GameStop can be explained only by massive counterfeiting of shares.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which along with other regulators could confirm whether the patterns seen in GameStop trading constitute fraud, has known about and largely ignored practices like this for years. The financial media also ignores this systemic corruption.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works.\n\n## Naked Short Selling and Fails to Deliver\n\nThe SEC allows traders to *short* a stock, which means to sell it even if they don\u2019t own it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and bank the difference. Short sellers borrow the stock, usually from a broker, who either has it in their inventory, borrows it from another broker, or vows to \u201clocate\u201d the stock when the time comes and cover the short.\"\n\n[Continue Reading here](https://prospect.org/power/how-the-gamestop-hustle-worked/)",
