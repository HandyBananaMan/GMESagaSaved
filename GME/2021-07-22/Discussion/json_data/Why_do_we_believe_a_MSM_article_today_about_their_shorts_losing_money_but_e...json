Isn\u2019t it just FUD like yesterday\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s. What gives. Why so many people blindly thinking that\u2019s a real number.  Not one has been yet apparently.",
    "title": "Why do we believe a MSM article \u201ctoday\u201d about their shorts losing money but every other article is always lies and deceit. It\u2019s the same source. Who believes a liar the one day when the liar says what they want to hear. That\u2019s the day my guard is up the most. Cmon brighten up.",
