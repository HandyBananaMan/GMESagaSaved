# Title: Why do we believe a MSM article “today” about their shorts losing money but every other article is always lies and deceit. It’s the same source. Who believes a liar the one day when the liar says what they want to hear. That’s the day my guard is up the most. Cmon brighten up.

You can’t seriously want to believe an article just because it’s in favor of GameStop if the whole entire time this sub has disproven the source of the article. Isn’t it just FUD like yesterday’s and tomorrow’s. What gives. Why so many people blindly thinking that’s a real number.  Not one has been yet apparently.
