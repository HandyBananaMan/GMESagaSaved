<p>They've probably been saving up shorts and are intending to slowly push the price down all week. That's why they primed you with the "magical triangle TA" all last week.</p>
<p>Remember they are going to try to psychologically mess with you.  The price is fake.  Keep buying the dip. They need you to sell, don't do that.  This is a Hail Mary to shake you out.  Once the shorts they've stockpiled run out it's a done deal and everyone is 100% in.  BTFD.</p>
