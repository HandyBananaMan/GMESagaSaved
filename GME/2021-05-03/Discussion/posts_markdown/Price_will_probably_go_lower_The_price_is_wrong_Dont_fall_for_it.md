They've probably been saving up shorts and are intending to slowly push the price down all week. That's why they primed you with the "magical triangle TA" all last week.

Remember they are going to try to psychologically mess with you.  The price is fake.  Keep buying the dip. They need you to sell, don't do that.  This is a Hail Mary to shake you out.  Once the shorts they've stockpiled run out it's a done deal and everyone is 100% in.  BTFD.
