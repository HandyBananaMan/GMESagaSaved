I'm an idiot ape who made a million back in January with GME not knowing what I'm doing so maybe someone smarter can chime in.  Back in January during the huge run up we had 100-190 million trading volume per day.  We just hit $280 with almost no trading volume.  Doesn't this mean there is almost no sell side pressure?
