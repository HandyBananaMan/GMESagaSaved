#Title: Huge number of Puts expiring April 16. 382k Open Interest for strikes <$175. This is equivalent to 70% of the float and 7x higher than any other week in April. Are the shorts up to something, or just trying to make some money after the squeeze? ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Hi Fellow Apes,

I was going through the open interest (IO) on puts and calls for April and I found a serious outlier with April 16th! While this is a 'monthly' options date and therefore has been avaialbe for a while, it still has a significant number of puts between $175 and $25 (20% of all puts for that date), more than any of the other long term dates.

Below we will go through the huge volume of puts and what this potentially means through complete speculation.

**----------** **BOILERPLATE:**

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

**There is a MASSIVE number of Puts in Open Interest for April 16 (the same week as DFV's call options), equivalent to 70% of the float. This is a 'monthly' options date so the shorts probably filled these up before the Jan squeeze when they thought they could bankrupt GME. Either way, you can see they are really hoping for this ðŸš€ to abort launch haha.**

**---------- Options: Definitions**

Just to make sure everyone knows what we are talking about. I am just going to do a VERY quick summary of Puts / Calls including Volume, Open Interest, in the money (ITM) and out of the money (OTM). Just scroll to the next section if you are familiar with all the terms.

&#x200B;

**Call Option:**

>A call isÂ an option contract givingÂ the **owner the right, but not the obligation**, **to buy** a specified amount of anÂ underlying security at a **specified price** within a **specified time**.  
>  
>Call options **increase in value** as the stock **increases in price**

&#x200B;

**Put Option:**

>Put options give holders of the **option the right, but not the obligation, to sell** a specified amount of an underlying security at a specified price within a specified time frame.  
>  
>Put options **increase in value** as the stock **falls in price**

&#x200B;

**In the Money (ITM):**

>ITM indicates that an option has value in a strike price that is favorable in comparison to current price of the stock:  
>  
>An in-the-money ***call*** **option** means the option holder has the opportunity to **buy the security below its current market price**.  
>  
>An in-the-money ***put*** **option** means the option holder can **sell the security above its current market price.**

&#x200B;

**Out of the Money:**

>OTM indicates that the option has no current value since the strike price is unfavorable in comparison to the current price of the stock:  
>  
>An OTM **call option** has a **strike price** that is **higher** than the **current market price.**  
>  
>An OTM **put option** has a **strike price** that is **lower** than the **current market price**.

&#x200B;

**Price of Options:**

>The specified price for all options is known as the **strike price** and the specified time during which a sale is made is its **expiration or time to maturity**.  
>  
>When you see the price for a call or put, that is the price per share but options are usually sold in lots of 100 shares, therefore the price to buy the option is actually X \* 100. Also this means if you want to calculate the number of equivalent shares at an option price

&#x200B;

**Volume:**

>Volume refers to the number of trades completed each day. Each transactionâ€”regardless of whether it's an opening or closing transactionâ€”counts toward the daily volume.

&#x200B;

**Open Interest:**

>Total number of outstanding contracts that have not yet been settled. Even if there is volume during a day, but the total number of contracts does not change, then the OI will stay the same.  Open interest decreases when buyers (or holders) and sellers (or writers) of contracts close out more positions than were opened that day.

&#x200B;

**---------- April Options:**

Now that everyone is up to speed on options, lets take a look at the options for April. Please note that looking at options is always a snapshot in time since the number will change minute to minute. This snapshot was from \~11 am March 29, 2021:

Data was taken from [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1619740800&p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1619740800&p=GME&straddle=true)

**Update:** Added a puts under $1 row

https://preview.redd.it/80rsfynl61q61.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f8dd0bb91f60df2153b470c4ad93d0ed6963b8

Right away, you can see that April 16 is an extreme outlier. **There is 7x more put contracts in OI for April 16 than this week.**

To normalize the data, I also looked at total call options currently OTM for each week and while the puts are fairly in line with calls for weeks of April 1, 9, 23 and 30th (1.5-2.5x call options), **April 16 continues to be an outlier** with over **3.5x the put options in IO than call options.**

Put options only become valuable if the price of the stock goes below the strike price, **therefore someone is expecting the price to plummet (or want to make the price plummet) by April 16.**

For fun, I calculated the **cost of all the Puts IO** using current price (which I know is not how much it actually cost since the prices change all the time and drastically so, but whatever its still fun to do) brings us to approximately **$50,000,000.** That's a decent chunk of change to spend on betting the price will drop.

\---------- **Update: Future Options dates and Tesla**

As suggested in the comments, I looked at all the long term options dates and we also see some seriously high put options purchased at the July and January 2021 expiry dates. I also added a row to show % of puts at a price of $1 or below.

Only 4% of puts were purchased for Jan 2022 are for strike prices >$25, July it is 9% and April 16 is 20%.

I also look into this for **Tesla**, just as a comparison to see what size of the float do we see on all future options. I choose the **three future dates with the largest number of options** currently IO

&#x200B;

![Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/7k9aziv712q61.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ab752c327ace121ea827b4561ac2319b287d55)

You can see that there are **WAY fewer options being purchased with the % of float maxing out at 7.6%, but call volume is also in line with puts, unlike with GME.** And this is also a stock that is also seen some crazy volatile recently!

&#x200B;

**---------- What are they planning?**

To me this could signify a few things - from most to least likely (and would love to hear other people's theories):

1. **Update:** These put options were purchased back before the initial squeeze by the shorts hoping that they were going to bankrupt the stock before this time and make even more money on the drop. 2/3 of the puts are for a strike price below $25
2. The are **building up their stock of puts** to try and bring the price of the stock down and make money on it when they do.
3. After seeing DFV's calls at this date, they are directly betting against him by purchasing huge amounts of cheap puts (unlikely)
4. They calculated that the squeeze will happen before this date and **expect the price to drop back down by this time**, hopefully recouping a bit of their losses. (very unlikely)

Either way, if you add up all OTM puts between now and April 16, it represents **90% of the entire float!**

Should we prepare for craziness on that week? **probably not but this could become a self fulfilling prophecy so who knows!**

I think if we don't see them try to refill this hopper after April 16, it will be quite telling that they are running out of steam.

&#x200B;

**---------- TLDR:**

**There is a MASSIVE number of Puts in Open Interest for April 16 (the same week as DFV's call options), equivalent to 70% of the float. This is a 'monthly' options date so the shorts probably filled these up before the Jan squeeze when they thought they could bankrupt GME. Either way, you can see they are really hoping for this ðŸš€ to abort launch haha.**

for those that want the raw numbers: a reminder that its the Open Interest that we care about, not the volume:
