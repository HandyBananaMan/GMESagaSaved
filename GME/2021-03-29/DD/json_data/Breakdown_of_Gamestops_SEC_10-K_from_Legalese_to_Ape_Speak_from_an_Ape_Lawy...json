Provide my own theories on why GME referred to the short squeeze in their SEC Filings Form 10-k (based on my interpretation of the legalese); and\n3. To provide an explanation of ANOTHER PIECE of the GME puzzle. This DD is not meant to replace all of the other excellent DD out there that deals with all the calculations, conclusions, explanations, etc. I encourage you to read everything and understand that this is just another tool in the toolbox. This post is meant to complement existing theories and DD that have relied on non-legalese data.\n\n\\*NOT LEGAL ADVICE, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. FULL DISCLAIMER AT BOTTOM OF POST\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Important - Different \ud83e\udd8ds can come to different conclusions when reading legalese, AND THIS IS OK!**\n\n* Conclusions & theories based on reading/interpreting legalese IS NOT THE SAME as conclusions & theories based on reading/interpreting numbers.\n* \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d example:\n   * In Math, \ud83c\udf4c+\ud83c\udf4c= \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\n   * In Legalese,  if I have \ud83c\udf4c and you have \ud83c\udf4c MAYBE that means we have \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c together.\n      * But what if I don't want to combine my  \ud83c\udf4c with your  \ud83c\udf4c?\n      * In that case just because you have a  \ud83c\udf4c and I have a  \ud83c\udf4c , doesn't necessarily mean that WE have  \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c.\n      * The answer could just as easily be that if I have  \ud83c\udf4c and you have  \ud83c\udf4c , all that means is that we each have one  \ud83c\udf4c.\n   * Confused?\n   * Welcome to the practice of law!\n   * This is why we have court hearings, because there are two (or multiple) sides and theories to different situations and it's up to a judge to figure out which side is most likely correct.\n* So what does this mean about my posts/DD?\n   * It means that I have my theories based on my interpretation of the legalese.\n   * BUT I've seen a lot of excellent comments/messages from other \ud83e\udd8ds with different (and equally excellent) opinions of their takeaway from interpreting legalese.\n* And this is perfectly ok!

Therefore they\u2019re setting up a legitimate reason to undertake action to explicitly get rid of short sellers. Without this, I think they could be in interesting legal water in the price manipulation territory but at the very least they wouldn\u2019t be able to force institutions holding their shares to comply with a complete recall for vote -

(Think of every single Suits Montage you've seen where they are pouring over books/computers preparing for a court case the next day)\n* Example #1: \"Without Limitation\"\n   * I was inspired to write my first post because a lot of people were incorrectly interpreting the phrase \"without limitation\" to mean that GME confirmed, without a doubt, that there is a short squeeze with an unlimited price coming.\n   * And while that is what we all want, it's COMPLETELY incorrect to assume that, especially with all of the legal disclaimers and phrases they are using.\n   * I explained why, in my first post, the phrase \"without limitation\" does not in fact refer to the value of the short squeeze, and instead refers to the fact that the list of factors is not exhaustive.\n* Example #2: \"To the Extent\"\n   * While some are saying that they still read GME's sentence to mean that they are confirming the stock is currently shorted despite what I've said, I'm here to say that that's your opinion and you're entitled to it.\n   * BUT\n   * I'm here to give you some DD by telling you that, in legalese, this is completely incorrect.\n   * And I've even provided official court cases to support my DD that \"To the Extent\" means \"IF\". (See Update #1)\n   * I know this is not the good news that you want to hear.\n   * BUT if you want to learn how to read SEC documents, or any legal documents, especially to help yourselves in the future, please understand that these interpretations I'm providing are not coming out of thin air.\n   * There's a reason that I'm interpreting LEGALESE TO \ud83e\udd8d SPEAK, and that reason is that if you don't know which words/phrases/grammatical structures to look out for, there is a strong possibility that you will completely misunderstand what is being said.\n   * u/CecaniahCorabelle made an [excellent point](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfrvgq/breakdown_of_gamestops_sec_10k_from_legalese_to/gspgdgm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):  \"Not arguing either but **how you read it versus what is actually legally represented is different**.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Previous Legalese to \ud83e\udd8d Speak Posts:**\n\n1.
