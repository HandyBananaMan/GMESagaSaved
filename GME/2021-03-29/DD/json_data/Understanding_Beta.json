    "selftext": " Good Morning Everyone\n\nI'm just a simple Ape but I can read things and stuff.\n\nI've see lots of chatter about negative Beta, followed by lots of hype.\n\nIts a short read and easy to understand. [Sauce.](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/)\n\n## What Is the Beta?  \n\nThe value of any stock index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500  Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we  conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering  buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up  and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to  hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are  rising. \n\n\n\nThe [beta is the number](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070615/what-formula-calculating-beta.asp)  that tells the investor how that stock acts compared to all other  stocks, or at least in comparison to the stocks that comprise a relevant  index. \n\n\n\nBeta measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price  fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it  gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater  market's. Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of  other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter '\u00df' to represent beta. \n\n## Analyzing Beta  \n\nBeta is calculated using [regression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regression.asp)  analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move  with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's  price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1  means it tends to be less volatile than the market. \n\n\n\nMany young technology companies that trade on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq-nm.asp) stocks have a beta greater than 1. Many [utility sector](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utilities_sector.asp) stocks have a beta of less than 1. \n\n\n\nEssentially, beta expresses the [trade-off](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskreturntradeoff.asp) between minimizing risk and maximizing [return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/return.asp).  Say a company has a beta of 2. This means it is two times as volatile  as the overall market. We expect the market overall to go up by 10%.  That means this stock could rise by 20%. On the other hand, if the  market declines 6%, investors in that company can expect a loss of 12%. \n\nIf a stock had a beta of 0.5, we would expect it to be half as volatile  as the market: A market return of 10% would mean a 5% gain for the  company. \n\nHere is a basic guide to beta levels: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an [inverse relation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverse-correlation.asp)  to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue  that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend  to do better when the stock market declines.\n* **Beta of 0**: Basically, [cash](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash.asp) has a beta of 0. In other words, regardless of which way the market moves, the value of cash remains [unchanged](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unchanged.asp) (given no inflation).\n* **Beta between 0 and 1**:\u00a0Companies that are less  volatile than the market have a beta of less than 1 but more than 0.  Many utility companies fall in this range.\n* **Beta of 1**:\u00a0A beta of 1 means a stock mirrors the  volatility of whatever index is used to represent the overall market. If  a stock has a beta of 1, it will move in the same direction as the  index, by about the same amount. An [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) that mirrors the S&P 500 will have a beta close to 1.\n* **Beta greater than 1**: This denotes a volatility that is greater than the [broad-based index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broad-basedindex.asp). Many new technology companies have a beta higher than 1.\n* **Beta greater than 100**: This is impossible, as it  indicates volatility that is 100 times greater than the market. If a  stock had a beta of 100, it would go to 0 on any decline in the stock  market. If you see a beta of over 100 on a research site it is usually a  statistical error or the stock has experienced a wild and probably  fatal price swing. For the most part, stocks of established companies  rarely have a beta higher than 4.\n\n## Why Beta Is Important  \n\nAre you prepared to take a loss on your investments? Many people are not  and they opt for investments with low volatility. Others are willing to  take on additional risk for the chance of increased rewards. Every  investor needs to have a good understanding of their own [risk tolerance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risktolerance.asp), and a knowledge of which investments match their risk preferences. \n\n  \n\nUsing beta to understand a security's volatility can help you choose the securities that meet your criteria for risk.\n\nInvestors who are very risk-averse should put their money into assets with low betas, such as utility stocks and [Treasury bills](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp). Investors who are willing to take on more risk may want to invest in stocks with higher betas. \n\n## Where to Find the Beta Number  \n\nMany [brokerage firms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerage-company.asp)  calculate the betas of securities they trade and then publish their  calculations in a beta book. These books offer estimates of the beta for  almost any [publicly-traded company](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp). \n\nYahoo! Finance is among the websites that publish beta numbers. Enter  the company name or symbol in the search field, then click on  \"Statistics.\" You'll find the beta listed under \"Stock Price History.\"  The beta on Yahoo! compares the activity of the stock over the last five  years to that of the S&P 500 Index. For example, as of Oct. 27,  2020, the beta for Microsoft (MSFT), as found on Yahoo! Finance, is  0.92. \n\n  \n\nA beta of \"0.00\" on Yahoo! Finance means that the stock is either a [new issue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/newissue.asp) or doesn't yet have a beta calculated for it.\n\n## Warnings About Beta  \n\nThe biggest drawback to using beta to make an investment decision is  that beta is a historical measure of a stock's volatility. It can show  you the pattern so far but it can't tell you what's going to happen in  the future. \n\nThe second caveat for using beta is that it is a measure of [systematic risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp), which is the risk that the market faces as a whole. The [market index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp)  to which a stock is being compared is affected by market-wide risks.  So, beta can only take into account the effects of market-wide risks on  the stock. The other risks the company faces are specific to the  company.",
