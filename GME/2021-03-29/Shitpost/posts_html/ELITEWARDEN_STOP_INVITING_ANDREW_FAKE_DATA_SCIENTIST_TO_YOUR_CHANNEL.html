<p>Please learn from Pixel's mistake. Andrew is going to drag you through the mud. He's going to take something you say, hype it up and then you're going to be the fallboy. Why are you doing this. It's bad enough that mods aren't taking down uncle bruce and andrew mo's spam posts here. You don't need to associate with him/them. u/wardenelite</p>
