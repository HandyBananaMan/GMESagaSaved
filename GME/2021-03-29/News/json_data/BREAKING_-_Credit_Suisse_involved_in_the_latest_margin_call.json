    "selftext": "\nA significant US-based hedge fund defaulted on margin calls made last week by Credit Suisse and certain other banks. Following the failure of the fund to meet these margin commitments, Credit Suisse and a number of other banks are in the process of exiting these positions. While at this time it is premature to quantify the exact size of the loss resulting from this exit, it could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results, notwithstanding the positive trends announced in our trading statement earlier this month. We intend to provide an update on this matter in due course.  \n\n[https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-us-based-hedge-fund-202103.html](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-us-based-hedge-fund-202103.html)",
