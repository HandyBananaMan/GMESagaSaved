The banks you're seeing are the ones doing the margin call. It may or may not be related to gme. Either way, this bodes well for us. If new banks are just now reporting a margin call default, that tells me new block sales incoming as they liquidate.

This means a very volatile market. Even if this was only one hedge fund and even if they weren't short gme - a very volatile market means a higher chance that a fund with a gme short position will be on the wrong end of a trade and default on a margin call. 

A potential catalyst if I ever fucking saw one.  LFG.
