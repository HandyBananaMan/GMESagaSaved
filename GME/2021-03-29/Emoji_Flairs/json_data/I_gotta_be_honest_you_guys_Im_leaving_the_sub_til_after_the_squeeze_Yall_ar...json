You\u2019re arguing and becoming manic. I don\u2019t even check the GME ticker much anymore TBH. I might actually uninstall my trading app to really enforce diamond hands and relieve myself of exposure.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve had a blast, love y\u2019all, talk to y\u2019all on the other side ;).\n\nI love this stock.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\n\nEdit: just wanted to say for my apes - pride is a useless tool. Anyway, I\u2019m still active on Reddit in general and so seeing in my inbox the comments on this thread. I\u2019m noticing that there are shill accounts goading me/heckling me/calling me a female genitalia (praise be). I made this edit to let y\u2019all know that I find this to be confirmation that shills are using our beloved sub as a war ground. They need it. This gives me even more resolve, but more importantly is confirmation that they\u2019re desperate. They must be desperate if they\u2019re dependent on this place for their sabotage operations. Take this as you will. I meant what I said. I love y\u2019all, but truly intend to distance myself from the noise and find sweet refuge in the space of my conviction. Wasn\u2019t meant to be a vanity post but rather a message and invitation to others. Be good to yourself and trust what you already know. There aren\u2019t many opportunities in life to express your values and resolve. This is one. See y\u2019all on the other side.",
