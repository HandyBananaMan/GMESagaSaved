    "selftext": "PSA to all apes!   \n\n\nLast week we've been showered in bias confirming news. Hedge funds blown out, negative betas so unreal we've nutted multiple holes in our pants, Kenny G suggesting a market crash is imminent in the FT. Basically, we've been bouncing off the walls like.... apes, waiting for Monday.   \n\n\nJust a word of advice: STAY FUCKING CALM AND TEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS! This almost sounds too good to be true and several people have already been very critical about some of these reports. For all we know this is another hype play followed by ladder attacks to try and destroy our spirits.   \n\n\nSo go outside, enjoy life, give your wife's boyfriend a foot massage and just HODL!   \n\n\n(not financial advice)",
