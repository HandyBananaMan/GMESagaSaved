(Everything I say here can be verified through direct experience)

I heard we raised our floor? Say no more.

Due to the recent HF fuckery, I have been informed that the new floor is now **$10,000,000**

I have since updated my observable image from a previous post. If you didn’t see my previous post. here it is:

*“”Observation literally changes reality you smooth brained APES.* 

*I observe. Therefore I am.* 

*Do you realise the significance of that sentence?*

*In quantum physics we call this the* ***OBSERVER EFFECT.***

*“”The act of observing will influence the phenomenon being observed. The* ***observer effect*** *is the fact that observing a situation or phenomenon necessarily changes it“”*

*In ape: just by observing, the observer can change the very thing they are looking at.*

*Now lets apply this here. Look at (****observe****) this image all day long, set it as your wallpaper. Get comfortable with seeing GME at this price. Get it engraved into your brain.*

*$10,000,000 is literally the* ***FLOOR.***

*\*Now if you can please excuse me, I have some observing to do\**

*Also this is not financial advice, I am still being breastfeed by my dad.””*
