<p>I'm sure many of you are excited at the thought of HFs getting margin called; I sure as shit am, but there's something that we all need to remember going forward.</p>
<p>When these big banks look to close out their clients positions, they wont start with buying up their shorts, they'll first do huge block trades of $billions at once, which will cause the entire market to be affected as major players have to alter their positions. The reality is that GME will likely be dragged down by the wider market before we board the rocket ship, and we all need to be prepared to see red before green. And if it's Shitadel getting margin called we should expect to see the market extremely red and GME with it.</p>
<p>We're getting closer to the end-game, now is not the time to panic if we drop a significant amount for a day.</p>
<p>Edit: A lot of apes are commenting about negative delta and how the market bleeding is good for GME; it likely is, no doubt, but you shouldn't expect an instant boost to GME. We may see our numbers fall before we slingshot back up. The truth is the Delta value and it's impact is up to interpretation and I just want to make sure we're prepared for the worst.</p>
