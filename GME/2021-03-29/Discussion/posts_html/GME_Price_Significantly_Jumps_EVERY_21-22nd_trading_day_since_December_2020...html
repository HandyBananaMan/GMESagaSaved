<h1>Theory/TL;DR</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There seems to be a consistent pattern in GME's price jumping around the <strong>21st/22nd trading day</strong> of every month, <strong>since the December 22, 2020 price jump.</strong></p>
<p>This may be related to MM's/Shitadel <strong>21-Day</strong> <strong>fail-to-deliver,</strong> since GME jumps in price even without any catalysts on those particular days.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> ~~I'm unable to find any concrete info from~~ <strong>~~SEC/FINRA~~</strong> ~~about the 21-day FTD rule for Market Makers (I've seen several posts across diff subreddits about it)~~. <strong>Found it, see edit below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> I found this <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/7140">FINRA 7140 rule</a> about <strong>T+21 days</strong> and it mentions the following:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(3) Automatic Lock-in</strong>  </p>
<p>Any trade that remains open (i.e. unmatched or unaccepted) at the end of its entry day will be carried over for continued comparison and reconciliation. The System will automatically lock in and submit to DTCC as such any carried-over T to <strong>T+21</strong> (calendar day) trade if it remains open as of 2:30 p.m. on the next business day. The System will carry over any T+22 (calendar day) or older "as/of" trade that remains open, but such trade will not be subject to the automatic lock-in process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The part that threw me off from the above rule is that it mentions <strong>calendar days</strong> =\</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Apes ü¶ç, this isn't DD. I'm simply sharing my observation and would love others' input (hence <strong>marked as a Discussion</strong>).</p>
<p>Now, we all know the reported short interest is BS, and if it was as low as they're reporting, this particular price pattern would not persist.</p>
<p>According to some past posts (not Shitadelling on anyone's DD, respect to all apes contributing to this beautiful community!), a lot of emphasis was placed on <strong>options expiry date</strong> (Friday); esp the 3rd Friday of every month-- the assumption has been that GME's price will significantly jump on those particular days.</p>
<p>However, GME seems to jump every <strong>21st and 22nd trading days</strong>, and not necessarily on Friday's options expiry date.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>------ My Thoughts</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>Shitadel and friends purposely bring down price on options expiry date in order to slow down momentum and delay MOASS. However, if options expiry date happens to be around the <strong>21st/22nd trading day,</strong> then we may see an even higher price jump on those particular days.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Perhaps I may not have explained myself properly/worded this post correctly, considering the comments. To be clear, <strong>I see a relation in the</strong> <strong>21-day FTD rule</strong> (MM's can't locate shares to deliver) to GME's price jump around every <strong>21-22 trading days</strong> (again, not calendar days), ever since December 22, 2020.</p>
<p>I'm assuming the price jump on Dec. 22, 2020 occurred because <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/node/18366/html">Ryan Cohen filed a 13D</a> on 12/21/2020, increasing his position in $GME, which served as a catalyst. This is likely where the HFs/MMs knew they truly were screwed.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> I am NOT predicting dates of a MOASS here, just simply pointing out my observation in $GME price jumps. I explain more in detail below, with pics for my fellow apes who can't read.</p>
<p><strong>Also, I didn't flair this as DD because this ain't no bombshell discovery.</strong></p>
<p>I would simply like some insight and hoping an intelli-ape can shed some light on this.</p>
<p>I'm sure some smart ape must've noticed this price pattern before.</p>
<p>Me just a dumb ape who has a brain as smooth as the buns on this filet o' fishy:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/pav0v0v8pmu61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be24aeb1e7b31a4fe48079be274896bb1c34ffc">LOL! This is a fish sammich from McDonald's for those asking üòÇüòÇ</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>------ My Observation</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So check this...</p>
<p>Last month, I noticed an <strong>interesting pattern</strong> and didn't want to post about it until I tested out the theory to see if it played out this month as well.</p>
<p>And lo-and-beHODL, it happened again.</p>
<p>This is something I noticed in Feb, and the price jump has been consistent since <strong>December 2020</strong> (though I did see a similar trend in <strong>November</strong>, but on different trading days: Nov 25-28th, if you wanna take a look).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Price Jumps every 21-22nd Trading Day since Dec 2020</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Trading Day:</strong> days the U.S. stock market is open, excluding any weekends/holidays.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/sitybl06k0v61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4327b96dcd3d4088f296cdce2851a946b9b32c10">REMINDER: market will be closed Friday, April 2nd.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Alright, so around every <strong>21-22nd trading day,</strong> since the December 22, 2020 price jump, $GME tends to jump up significantly, followed by a downward price pressure typically on the <strong>23rd trading day.</strong></p>
<p>Friendly reminder, I'm talking <strong>trading days</strong> here, and not the 21st or 22nd of every month.</p>
<p><strong>This may have a direct correlation to the 21-day FTD rule for Market Makers.</strong></p>
<p>I'm going to try my best to break this down, but it may help you understand better if you take a look at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME">GME's price history</a> as I explain this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>------ The Pattern</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On the <strong>21st</strong> trading day (since the Dec 22, 2020 price jump), <strong>momentum</strong> in price starts to build up</p>
<p>On the <strong>22nd</strong> trading day, the price <strong>significantly jumps</strong> <strong>up</strong> from the previous day</p>
<p>On the <strong>23rd</strong> trading day, the price starts to <strong>decrease</strong></p>
<p>This same pattern has occurred every month since Dec 2020.</p>
<p>Now, let's put this theory into action and take a look at $GME's price jump since <strong>December 2020:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2bkzgsiek0v61.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6db34284c029da30bf46ca8e0623ebabdc08ce0d">\~ $7 price jump from the Dec 21st closing price</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>December 21</strong> (Mon): $GME closed at <strong>$15.53</strong></p>
<p><strong>December 22</strong> (Tues): $GME high <strong>$20.04</strong> (price jumped significantly from prev day's close)</p>
<p><strong>December 23</strong> (Wed): $GME high <strong>$22.35</strong> (price slightly jumped from prev day's high)</p>
<p><strong>December 24</strong> (Thurs): $GME closed at <strong>$20.15</strong> (price starts to decrease)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/bnb5r4eqk0v61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f86b29696fbdc9c23e39125cf4fb95277e64134a</p>
<p>Now, if you count the # of trading days from <strong>December 22</strong> (when the price started to jump), you'll notice the same pattern in January:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/dzrcl984l0v61.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e83339b52bc4323718962469614131a062d1bb8">\~ $116 price jump from the Jan 21st closing price</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>January 21</strong> (Thurs): $GME closed at <strong>$43.03</strong></p>
<p><strong>January 22</strong> (Fri) : $GME high was <strong>$76.76</strong> (notice the momentum in price? This was the <strong>21st</strong> trading day from the Dec. 22nd jump)</p>
<p><strong>January 25</strong> (Mon): $GME high was $<strong>159.18</strong> (this was the <strong>22nd</strong> trading day and price jumped significantly)</p>
<p>Price went down slightly on <strong>Jan 26th,</strong> and on <strong>Jan 27/28</strong> it rocketed to <strong>$380/$483.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Now I know January price continued to rise even after the <strong>23rd trading day</strong>, but this is because of the massive media attention, RobbingHood Vlad-born-in-Bulgaria's f*ckery, FOMO, etc.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the price still followed the pattern on the <strong>21st and 22nd</strong> trading day in <strong>January.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/wfznl0v9l0v61.jpg?width=599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b18b0a3f66da936901f8f435757c683002dff180</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Moving on, it happens yet again in <strong>February.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/bmz95jycl0v61.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4780ce2df9522563e8abef9835906c2aec611a56">\~ $140 price jump from the Feb 23rd closing price</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>February 23</strong> (Tues): $GME closed at <strong>$44.97</strong> (interesting how it opened and closed at the same exact price)</p>
<p><strong>February 24</strong> (Wed): $GME high was <strong>$91.71</strong> (again, price momentum building up on the <strong>21st</strong> trading day since the <strong>Jan 25th</strong> price jump)</p>
<p><strong>February 25</strong> (Thurs): $GME high was <strong>$184.68</strong> (price significantly jumped on the <strong>22nd</strong> trading day)</p>
<p><strong>February 26</strong> (Fri): $GME closed at <strong>$101.74</strong> (price decreased on <strong>23rd</strong> trading day)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/0nn7c66kl0v61.jpg?width=599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b07df71f392e8ae6fcd28c24e1eb986d3d03ac2</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here we go again in <strong>March</strong>, we see the same pattern:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/bpo4e29nl0v61.png?width=921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72a1adc3220f05058ffe65bed839cefcfb69988a">\~ $98 price jump from the Mar 24th closing price</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>March 24</strong> (Wed): $GME closed at <strong>$120.34</strong></p>
<p><strong>March 25</strong> (Thurs): $GME high was <strong>$187.50</strong> (this was the <strong>21st</strong> trading day since <strong>Feb 24th</strong> price build up)</p>
<p><strong>March 26</strong> (Fri): $GME high was <strong>$218.93</strong> (again, price had a nice jump from previous day's close)</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Even after the March 24th f*ckery where the price was dropped all the way to $118.62, it <strong>STILL</strong> jumped up on the 21st trading day: March 25th.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I didn't include the <strong>March 8-10th</strong> price jump because I believe that was the result of catalysts: GME announced Ryan Cohen to lead special Board Committee on 3/8, including appointing a new CTO. On 3/9, GME announced the Q4 earnings release date.</p>
<p>My point is that **<strong>aside from catalysts**</strong>, GME price jumps on those particular 21/22 trading days. This goes to show that shorts obviously haven't covered because <strong>GME increases in price even without any catalysts.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>------ Question about FTD</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Can this be related to the <strong>21 days failure-to-deliver</strong> rule for Market Makers (Shitadel) because they're unable to deliver the shares?</p>
<p>~~I've read DD on the~~ <strong>~~21-day FTD~~</strong> ~~rule for MM's, but can't for the life of me find this rule online; please link if anyone knows~~. Found the <strong>FINRA 7140</strong> rule, see edit below.</p>
<p>If true, this proves what we all already know-- <strong>shorts obviously have not covered.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I found this <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/7140">FINRA 7140 rule</a> about <strong>T+21 days</strong> and it mentions the following:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(3) Automatic Lock-in</strong>  </p>
<p>Any trade that remains open (i.e. unmatched or unaccepted) at the end of its entry day will be carried over for continued comparison and reconciliation. The System will automatically lock in and submit to DTCC as such any carried-over T to <strong>T+21</strong> (calendar day) trade if it remains open as of 2:30 p.m. on the next business day. The System will carry over any T+22 (calendar day) or older "as/of" trade that remains open, but such trade will not be subject to the automatic lock-in process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>------ Assumptions for April</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If indeed this pattern continues, then it's likely we see a similar pattern around <strong>April 26-28th</strong> (if my ape math is wrong by a day or so, pattern may occur earlier on Friday, <strong>Apr 23rd</strong>).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1><strong> April Update </strong></h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Alrighty apes, the T+21 FTD occured once again on <strong>April 26th</strong> as predicted.</p>
<p>Granted, this time around the price jumps weren't as significant as the prior months', but nonetheless, the price jumps <em>did</em> occur on the 21st and 22nd trading days, especially on low volume.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>April 23</strong> (Fri): $GME closed at <strong>$151.18</strong></p>
<p><strong>April 26</strong> (Mon): $GME high was <strong>$174.68</strong> (this was the <strong>21st</strong> trading day since <strong>Mar 25th</strong> price build up). Also worth noting, GME hit <strong>$198</strong> in after hours.</p>
<p>There were over 6k options expiring at the <strong>$200 strike price</strong>, and Shitadel made sure it didn't hit $200. Otherwise, we would've seen a significant spike in price since those options would've been in-the-money.</p>
<p><strong>April 27</strong> (Tues): $GME high was <strong>$188</strong> (again, price jumped on the 22nd trading day from previous day's close)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8dejfl37c5171.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a53af49735e2d46774d4d67e8e5c290d154e2a">\~ $37 price jump from the April 23rd closing price. After hours jumped to $198 on 4\/26-- this would make it a \~$47 price jump</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>------ May Prediction</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The next T+21 FTD cycle is expected to occur on <strong>May 25-26th.</strong></p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are nearly 4k options expiring at the $200 strike price, so expect some resistance at this price point.</p>
<p>If we're able to break through $200, we should see a pretty handsome price jump.</p>
<p>~~I will make updates here on May 27th.~~</p>
<p>Updated <strong>May 30th.</strong> Sorry for the delay, I was traveling and jet lagged !</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1><strong> May Update </strong></h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>My beautiful apes and apettes, we broke through $200!</p>
<p>I don't know about y'all, but I'm convinced the <strong>T+21 FTD cycle</strong> plays a role in $GME price jumps every 21-22 trading days.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn't think we'd break through $250 (given MM f*ckery), but we friggin' did it!</p>
<p><strong>Personal opinion:</strong> I feel the NFT news played a role in the price jumps-- although I understand it wasn't officially announced by GME, but media did pick it up.</p>
<p>Additionally, once we broke through $200, I believe FOMO also played a part in us ripping to $268 (we haven't seen $200 since March 30th).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Let's take a look at the price action:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>May 24</strong> (Mon): $GME closed at <strong>$180.01</strong></p>
<p><strong>May 25</strong> (Tues): $GME high was <strong>$217.11</strong> (this was the <strong>21st</strong> trading day since <strong>Apr 26th</strong> price build up)</p>
<p><strong>May 26</strong> (Wed): $GME high was <strong>$248.48</strong> (again, price jumped on the 22nd trading)</p>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I was surprised that we continued to see price increases on the 23rd and 24th trading day (past months we see price decreasing on the 23rd trading day and following days).</p>
<p><strong>May 27</strong> (Thurs): $GME hit <strong>$264</strong> (this was the 23rd trading day)</p>
<p><strong>May 28</strong> (Fri): $GME hit a high of <strong>$268.80</strong> (24th trading day)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="$88.79 price jump from the May 24th closing price." src="https://preview.redd.it/gws5gtzc4d271.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac5336a580a3118914e8ff8da45b4ab01b7043b" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>------ June Prediction</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>June T+21 FTD dates: <strong>6/24-6/25</strong></p>
<p>June is expected to be be an exciting month: GME annual shareholders meeting is on <strong>6/9</strong> and <strong>Q1 2021 results</strong> should be announced the first/second week of June (let me know if I'm missing other events!).</p>
<p>Recently, we haven't seen much price increase due to catalysts, or positive announcements. With that being said, I wouldn't be surprised if Shitadel continues suppressing the price on good news.</p>
<p><strong>Friendly reminder:</strong> This post was never intended to predict dates of a MOASS or specific price predictions. It's simply following the T+21 FTD cycle price jumps, <strong>with or without any catalysts.</strong></p>
<p>MOASS is inevitable and it will happen when it happens. This FTD cycle is interesting to me as it proves shorts haven't covered.</p>
<p>And it's also something for me to look forward to since we've been trading sideways for some time :)</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>------ Things to Consider</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> I'm referring to a price jump with or without any catalysts, given the MM's 21-day fail-to-deliver. I am NOT fixing dates here.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In other words, regardless of what price point GME is trading at, this pattern reflects an increase in price on those particular <strong>trading days.</strong></p>
<p>This doesn't mean the price jumps will necessarily be higher than the previous month's. It's simply tracking the T+21 FTD cycle.</p>
<p>Of course A LOT can happen between now and then. GME can announce the shareholder meeting date, appoint new CFO, new Board members, more SEC filings, etc.</p>
<p>And as expected, more HF/Shitadel and friends f*ckery expected.</p>
<p><strong>But regardless of a catalyst or not, it appears that a price jump always occurs on these particular trading days, since Dec 22, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>With that said, anyone else seeing this pattern, or am I trippin?</p>
