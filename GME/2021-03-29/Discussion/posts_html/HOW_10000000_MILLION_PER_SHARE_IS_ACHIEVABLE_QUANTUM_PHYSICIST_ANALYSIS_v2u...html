<p>(Everything I say here can be verified through direct experience)</p>
<p>I heard we raised our floor? Say no more.</p>
<p>Due to the recent HF fuckery, I have been informed that the new floor is now <strong>$10,000,000</strong></p>
<p>I have since updated my observable image from a previous post. If you didn’t see my previous post. here it is:</p>
<p><em>“”Observation literally changes reality you smooth brained APES.</em> </p>
<p><em>I observe. Therefore I am.</em> </p>
<p><em>Do you realise the significance of that sentence?</em></p>
<p><em>In quantum physics we call this the</em> <strong><em>OBSERVER EFFECT.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“”The act of observing will influence the phenomenon being observed. The</em> <strong><em>observer effect</em></strong> <em>is the fact that observing a situation or phenomenon necessarily changes it“”</em></p>
<p><em>In ape: just by observing, the observer can change the very thing they are looking at.</em></p>
<p><em>Now lets apply this here. Look at (</em><strong><em>observe</em></strong><em>) this image all day long, set it as your wallpaper. Get comfortable with seeing GME at this price. Get it engraved into your brain.</em></p>
<p><em>$10,000,000 is literally the</em> <strong><em>FLOOR.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>*Now if you can please excuse me, I have some observing to do*</em></p>
<p><em>Also this is not financial advice, I am still being breastfeed by my dad.””</em></p>
