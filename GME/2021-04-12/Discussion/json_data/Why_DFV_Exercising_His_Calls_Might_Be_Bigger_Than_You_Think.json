    "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am very smooth brained ape, but I do like looking under rocks to find snakes. This is all speculation on my part.\n\nBy now we\u2019ve all seen DFV\u2019s epic tweet asking if he should exercise all, part, or none of his calls. As expected the overwhelming majority of votes were to exercise all of his calls. There are several posts about this here and elsewhere, and one of the recurring concepts is \u201cIt doesn\u2019t REALLY matter because the market makers have already hedged against those calls\u201d. But have they really?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. When a call is sold, the market maker will try to avoid risk by hedging. They use a bunch of fancy Greek words that ape can\u2019t understand, but basically they are constantly balancing their risk by buying/selling stock against the likelihood that the call will be ITM. When the Delta is high enough that the call is ITM, they set aside those shares against execution at a future date.\n\nNow, there are a couple of things that we need to look at before we can say it doesn\u2019t REALLY matter if those calls are executed. First, if those calls aren\u2019t executed but sold to close, all the MM has to do is buy the calls back and put them in the loss pile. They pay the call holder the value of the shares and their obligation is complete. Except - they already hedged against the call. So those shares they are holding to hedge are now \u201cextra\u201d shares they don\u2019t need and are available to sell. Since GME stock is very rare, every extra share on the market decreases the rarity of our stock, and we don\u2019t want that.\n\nThe second thing to consider, and this is the speculation part, is what if the MM has hedged like a good little MM should but they don\u2019t actually HAVE the shares? Imagine you\u2019re a MM. You make lots of money on your option premiums and life is good. You have 3 vacation homes, 2 yachts, and 4 girlfriends. But you want more. So you look over at this pile of shares you have just sitting around hedging against calls for future dates and think \u201cthere has to be a way to make money on these\u201d. Enter Mr. Short Seller\u2026\n\nMr. Short Seller says \u201cHey MM, I\u2019d really like to borrow some of those shares you have just sitting there and I\u2019ll give you some extra tendies for the use of them\u201d. MM says \u201cOkay, but I\u2019ll need them back in a few months to cover some 4/16 calls I sold\u201d. \u201cNo problem!\u201d Except, somewhere along the way these pesky apes decided they really like the stonk, and they decided to buy every share in sight and just sit on the damn things. A few months down the road MM calls Mr. Short Seller and says \u201cHey, I\u2019m getting nervous here, I\u2019ve got these calls that may get exercised this week and I really need those shares back..\u201d Unfortunately for MM, Mr. Short Seller calls him back to tell MM he has looked everywhere, but there are no shares to be found.\n\nIf only the call holders would have sold those calls instead of exercising them they could have just bought them back, paid the money and washed their hands of it. Really, who exercises calls anyway? That\u2019s so apelike and uncivilized. Now they are both facing a FTD just because a bunch of damn apes like the stonk and decided they wanted the shares more than cash.\n\nAgain, I hove no proof that this is happening. But we know the MMs are greedy so why wouldn\u2019t they make money by loaning out their hedge shares? Mr. Short Seller has always been able to return the shares in the past, so it was just free money.\n\nIf I\u2019m way off base here please let me know. I know most of us don\u2019t have the cash to exercise our ITM calls but DFV does, and it might be a BFP (Big Fucking Problem) for the MM.\n\nEdit: TL;DR The MMs may have hedged their calls, but do they actually HAVE the shares?\n\nEdit 2: I was asked if DFV has enough calls to make a difference.  He, and others certainly might.\n\nFrom Stonk-O-Tracker (site that tracks all things GME) there are 27,662 calls expiring ITM this week.  AND from Barchart's website over 4,000!! of those calls are under $25 strikes, so easily exercisable even for retail.  Low shares available because HODL, and you can see where this is going...this might be an issue.",
