<p>I have been reading DD posts since mid January when I first climbed aboard the GME rocket. The quality of the DD for GME has been outstanding and has revealed the ways HFs can manipulate market instruments and metrics to serve their own purposes.</p>
<p>The shills have no valid counter arguments, they just try to spread FUD. The rules are changing now to curtail HFs ability to obfuscate their positions. They are moving assets into SPACs and lawyering up.</p>
<p>Remember, all DD is evaluated by everyone on the sub, it is transparent and open to critique. Read the DD, stay calm and be patient. Big thanks to all the DD creators, you are heroic genius apes.</p>
