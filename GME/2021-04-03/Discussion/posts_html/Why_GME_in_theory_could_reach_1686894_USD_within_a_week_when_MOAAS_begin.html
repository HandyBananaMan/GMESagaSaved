<p>Hello my dear apes, I got an interesting idea to bring to you guys. I have finally gained not 1, not 2, but 3 wrinkles on my pinky brain.</p>
<p>I did the number thingy and the result was pretty interesting.</p>
<p>First we have to know some interesting numbers and facts.</p>
<p>When we moon we will experience trading halts, lots of them. Don't worry it's pretty normal. It just takes longer to rise.</p>
<p>A trading halt occurs when a stock shows high velocity in an extended amount of time. It varies from 5 minutes to 10 minutes respectively.</p>
<p>A US trade day begins from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST, as we know. That is 390 minutes.</p>
<p>Important note: im not taking premarket into account. If i did the numbers would be Even greater. </p>
<p>Let's assume that when MOASS happens it can be halted 39 to 78 times in a single trade day. I assume that it won't repeat 78 times in a single day, given that the stock has to trade and some people may or may not paperhand/daytrade/Nakedshorts in the process.</p>
<p>(Due to new infomation the fair estimate a miximum amount of tradehalts can occour is 31,2 times, it's because the tradeing halt will occour within a 10% gain within 5 minuttes where it could halt between 5 to 10 minuttes.</p>
<p>So that is a repeating process. 5 minuttes tradeing, and 5 to 10 minuttes tradehalts. so about 31,2 tradehalts during a regular trade day, not takeing premarket into account. 390/12,5 = 31,2)</p>
<p>Let's say we take a conservative estimation and say its 25 halts in a day.</p>
<p>Why 25? because following can happend:
* some will sell
* ladder attacks
* glitches
* huge volosity
* tradeing halts on downticks</p>
<p>Now is the time to bring you Vietnam flashbacks to the good olâ€™ school days when we had exponential functionsâ€¦</p>
<p>the X-axis is each time a trade halts. So 1x = 1 halt. Let's go back and say one regular trade day is 25 halts. We now have a timeframe to work with.</p>
<p>The Y-axis is the value of GME in USD</p>
<p>Formula:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/54sbuqn8y0r61.png?width=110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8191defc5e8a50ba255c2a240566cc0303dacca9">The formula  i'm using is this one:</a></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> is the current price of GME, let's say right now it's 200 USD.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> is the rate that the price goes up.Lets say it's between 5 and 10 % increase before a tradeinghalt occurs, so 7.5%. so A is 1,075.</p>
<p>the equations is: f(x) = 200*1.075^x</p>
<p>It might just look like some funny letter numbers but it lead lead me to this picture:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="X= Halts 25 halts = 1 tradeing day       Y = Value of the stock" src="https://preview.redd.it/yd6qnt5fy0r61.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b66adf0a60e3aa734433f283ca73fa8cdc02a4a" /></p>
<p>If we use Volkswagen as an example as a time frame we can say the squeeze will last 4 to 5 days. We know that GME has a longer duration since it is common knowledge that GME is shorted far more than Volkswagen.</p>
<p>It will probably last a couple of weeks in my opinion.</p>
<p>So what's <strong>N</strong>? <strong>N</strong> is the price of <strong>1,686,894 USD</strong> on day 5 when GME moons respectively.</p>
<p>here are some more numbers:</p>
<p>Day 1: <strong>1,219 USD</strong></p>
<p>Day 2: <strong>7,437 USD</strong></p>
<p>Day 3: <strong>45,359 USD</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Day 10:  <strong>24,000,000,000  USD. (!!!)</strong></p>
<p>Therefore i think it is entirely possible to reach 7 digits, heck maybe even 8 digits, when they are done covering, even when trading halts are taken into account.</p>
<p>What is the takeaway? </p>
<ul>
<li>we now know that it would be a bummer to sell on the way up at the first day of the squese. </li>
<li>Pay attention to this graph when we moon</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>

<p>Not a financial advice, I just like the stock.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Error in title. Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>Edit2</strong> im just a stupid monkey, take everything with a grain of salt, there Are many variables to take into account. Im a very visual orianted person, so i wanted to see how it would look when this playes out.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong> Here is what i Will work on</p>
<ul>
<li>i want to figure out how long the squese Will last</li>
<li>i Will look into the nature of tradeing halts in the premarket</li>
<li>i Will look into prioer tradeing halts in the past regarding gme</li>
</ul>
