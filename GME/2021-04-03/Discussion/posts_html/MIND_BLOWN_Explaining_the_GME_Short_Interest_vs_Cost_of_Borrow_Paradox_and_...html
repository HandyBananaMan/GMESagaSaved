<p><em>Obligatory : Not a Financial Advisor. Do your own DD. I am making assumptions which could be wrong. I am naming specific brokers and entities only to serve as random examples - this does not prove that my theories about their activity is correct</em></p>
<p>TLDR: Either Brokers are hiding the true level of retail ownership in GME ... or there have been very few, if any, shorts covered since January. The logic-defying low cost of borrow on shares to short reflects that there are no shares available to short in the open market. I theorize the only shares that can be shorted are as a result of internal cross trades (explained below). </p>
<p>Please feel free to poke holes in my DD / ask questions. Thanks!! 🚀+ more 🚀 at the bottom. </p>
<p>INTRO—————</p>
<p>My theory attempts to confirm that GME is massively owned by retail investors across brokerage platforms, and simultaneously explains why reported SI has been declining while, confusingly, the supply of available shares to short has dwindled. </p>
<p>Many of us have been grappling with conflicting data. </p>
<p>On one hand, exchange reported SI has declined from 70mm shares (140% of float) to 10mm shares (20% of float). At the same time, there do not seem to be any available shares to borrow. </p>
<p>How can this be?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>As I write this, Interactive Brokers shows 143k shares to short at a rate of 1.24%. This does not make sense as in January shares available were 500k - 1mm at a rate of 20% or so. </p>
<p>The laws of supply and demand tell you that the more scarce something is, the higher the price should be. And yet in the case of GME available shares to borrow are going down, while the price to borrow is going down too. </p>
<p>Here’s more evidence of conflicting data from our own u/jeffamazon showing ONLY 1,000 of available GME shares available to short at a paltry rate of 0.5%</p>
<p>Link: https://twitter.com/jeffamazonx/status/1372980882399723527?s=21</p>
<p>I think the truth is that all of these brokerages (Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers, WeBull, 212 etc etc etc etc) actually have Tens and Tens and Tens of Millions of shares available to short. </p>
<p><em>However</em> if these brokers disclosed the available short capacity, they would reveal how many shares are owned. And it’s a lot. </p>
<p>ARTICLE————-
Read a quote from this April 2nd WSJ Article on GME and Stock Loan (full text at end of post):</p>
<p>“there will be occasions when two different clients of the same brokerage firm will take opposite sides of a transaction -- one buying and the other selling short. In some cases the firm will not execute those "two transactions on the exchange but instead cross those trades internally. The public short-interest numbers won't reflect that.”</p>
<p>Wow - take a moment to reflect on what they’re saying. </p>
<p>What the article is saying is that, for example, if an Ape owns 100 GME shares at Fidelity and Fidelity sees that a customer of theirs wants to short the stock - they will cross the buyer and seller together without reporting the trade to the market. </p>
<p>This is brilliant on the part of the broker....</p>
<p>Basically, they are laying the risk of a GME short squeeze off to clients who are misinformed enough to short GME. Fidelity doesn’t care if the money in their account moves to your account. It’s a wash to them. </p>
<p>In Other words, fidelity isn’t lending your share out to the street where they can’t keep track of the collateral, they’re lending it in-house where they can keep intra-day track of the collateral (sort of like what the DTCC wants to do). </p>
<p>This also explains why the cost of borrow is so low - this is a “risk free” trade for the broker. They are simply charging a customer interest to short a stock without moving any shares around. </p>
<p>So here comes part II of my theory - which I think is even more interesting. </p>
<p>Back to reported short interest. Let’s say we believe FINRA and the reported SI is in-fact 10MM. This would leave 40MM available to short (50MM float minus 10MM shorted). </p>
<p>Combine this information  with the fact that anecdotally hundreds or thousands of us have moved at least 10s of thousands or maybe millions of shares from, for example, Robinhood to Fidelity over the last few months. </p>
<p>If market capacity is 40MM shares to short and Fidelity customers own - say 10MM shares - then Fidelity should have maybe 20MM shares available for their customers to short. Instead, this number is ONLY in the tens of thousands. </p>
<p>CONCLUSION—————-
I believe only one of two things can be true:</p>
<p>Either </p>
<p>A) Broker reporting is accurate and there are TRULY zero available shares to short.  In this case, I would think the number of shares shorted are at least what they were in January. And we know &gt;100% of the float was shorted in January. If there is even 1 share shorted above the float, it is proof of naked shorting. </p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>B) Brokers are hiding the number of GME hodlers by intentionally under-reporting the number of shares available for short borrow. They know we are crowd-sourcing available shares and they cannot show the true number because it would reveal there are more holders than shares that exist. </p>
<p>For example, if TD, Fidelity, IBKR, - all the brokerages - reported there were 100million shares available to short based on shares held in their client accounts - it would prove to the market what many of us think is already true. That greater than 100% of the float is owned and this greater than 100% of the float is short.</p>
<p>Importantly, what exists on retail brokerages may not reflect what’s going on with institutional prime brokers. There can be, and almost certainly is, tons of short interest within the HF / institutional system as well.  As an example, on average shares traded daily are 44MM. Out of a float of 50MM, this means 88% of the float is traded every day <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/">link to average daily volume - Yahoo</a></p>
<p>Look up ADV vs. float for any normal stock and you will find a few % of the float is traded every day. If we assume GME is trading 5% of the float, then 44MM / .05 = an implied float of 880MM shares. I’m not saying there is or isn’t this many shares out there. But it’s sure strange. </p>
<p>Anyways, I digress...</p>
<p>As to why the borrow fee is so low, my theory is this is because Wall Street is max short. There are no more shares available to borrow. The only shares that can be lent are internally between customer accounts as per the WSJ article. This is a risk free trade for the Broker if they can start liquidating the short customer account as GME / if GME starts to squeeze. And it’s entirely possible that fidelity has big HFs, etfs, etc as customers. So if fidelity sees you are short $1mm GME and long $100MM Apple - you are covered if GME goes up 10,000% by selling Apple and so on ....</p>
<p>I find this theory interesting and, from a logic standpoint, extremely plausible. But please feel free to disagree. </p>

<h2>GameStop Called Attention to the Share-Lending Market. Here's What You Should Know. -- Journal Report</h2>
<p>11:02 am ET April 2, 2021 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Mark Hulbert </p>
<p>The <a href="https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=139905">GameStop</a> saga earlier this year focused attention on the share-lending market, a financial arena that relatively few investors know about.</p>
<p>But if you bought an index fund in recent years, chances are you likely benefited from the share-lending revenue that the fund earned.</p>
<p>This market is where investors go to borrow shares that they sell short -- betting on a price decline. The lenders are primarily large mutual funds (especially index funds), exchange-traded funds and pension funds. Share loans outstanding in the U.S. are valued at nearly $1 trillion, according to Peter Hillerberg, chief technology officer at Ortex Analytics, a company that monitors the share-lending market.</p>
<p>The revenue that can be earned by lending shares is substantial: About $10 billion in total was paid out for the privilege of borrowing shares last year, Mr. Hillerberg says. Revenue from such loans is one of the reasons that some index funds are able to keep their expense ratios low.</p>
<p>Only a small percentage of a typical company's publicly traded shares will be sold short at any given time. Currently, the average for a company in the S&amp;P 500 is about 1%, Mr. Hillerberg estimates. Not so for <a href="https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=139905">GameStop</a> in January, however. Its comparable ratio on Jan. 14 rose to 175.9%, which suggests that nearly twice as many shares were sold short as are outstanding.</p>
<p>Though that seems impossible, a perfectly benign explanation exists. Imagine that Jack borrows 100 shares of <a href="https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=139905">GameStop</a> from mutual fund No. 1 with the intention to short them. When those shares are shorted, they get bought by fund No. 2. Now, Jane wants to short-sell <a href="https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=139905">GameStop</a>, too. She borrows those same 100 shares from fund No. 2, and when she shorts them they are bought by fund No. 3. In theory, this process could go on indefinitely, Mr. Hillerberg says. "There is no theoretical upper limit on the ratio of a company's shares sold short to its free float."</p>
<p>This illustration assumes the same 100-share block of <a href="https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=139905">GameStop</a> is borrowed, shorted, bought and lent out again. In fact, there is no way of knowing whether a particular 100-share block of <a href="https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=139905">GameStop</a> stock bought or sold today is the same as what was transacted yesterday. That's because, once lent, those shares are part of the "fungible pool" of <a href="https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=139905">GameStop</a> stock, according to Roy Zimmerhansl, principal at Pierpoint Financial Consulting and former head of global securities lending at HSBC.</p>
<p>Mr. Zimmenhansl adds that it is also impossible to know precisely how many shares of a stock have been sold short at any given time. That's because there will be occasions when two different clients of the same brokerage firm will take opposite sides of a transaction -- one buying and the other selling short. In some cases the firm will not execute those "two transactions on the exchange but instead cross those trades internally. The public short-interest numbers won't reflect that.</p>
<p>Market for shareholder voting</p>
<p>Short selling is only one of the uses of the share-lending market. Another is to borrow shares and vote them in a corporate election.</p>
<p>This is possible because, in corporate law, share owners retain all the economic benefits of owning the stock, including any price appreciation and dividends, even while shares are out on loan. The right to vote, however, is held by those who actually hold the shares in their accounts -- even if those shares were borrowed. In effect, the share owner gives up the right to vote in return for earning interest on lending the shares.</p>
<p>Imagine a proxy context in which dissident shareholders who are beneficial owners of only a small number of shares are hoping to win seats on the company's board. It is possible that the dissidents could win those seats by borrowing enough shares the day before a shareholder vote, voting them, and then returning them a day later.</p>
<p>Some believe this makes a mockery of shareholder democracy. For some of the same reasons it is impossible to know at any given time a company's true short-interest ratio, a company has no way of knowing with certainty who its voting shareholders are at any given time, says Edward Rock, a law professor at New York University. In some close corporate elections, Prof. Rock says, it is virtually impossible to know who actually won.</p>
<p>To illustrate, he asks you to imagine you have 100 shares of a stock in your account and, without your knowledge, 50 of them are lent out. This happens often, since almost always our brokerage accounts are set up to give the brokerage firm the right to lend out our shares without telling us. In this particular case, you could in good faith vote your 100 shares and the borrower could in good faith vote his 50.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how voting ambiguities could arise. Prof. Rock says, "There is so much friction in the system that in any close election there is likely to be no verifiable answer to the question, 'Who won?' "</p>
<p>Change needed?</p>
<p>Many believe this situation should be changed. But many large institutions, especially index funds, would rather earn share-lending revenue than vote their shares. This cost-benefit calculation became particularly evident after the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019 relaxed rules that previously had encouraged index funds to vote their shares. Joshua Mitts, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, says that share lending from index funds grew by 58% in the wake of the SEC's relaxed guidance.</p>
<p>He adds that this cost-benefit calculation is also relevant to those who worry that, because index funds own large blocks of all companies, they will vote their shares in ways that discourage competition, preserving a kind of marketplace status quo. This may be a bigger concern in theory than in practice, however, Prof. Mitts says, because in most cases index funds appear to be eager -- some think too eager -- to forfeit their votes and earn share-lending revenue instead.</p>
