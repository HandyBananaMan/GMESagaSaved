    "selftext": "They literally just talk. I go in attics and crawl spaces to fix HVAC systems and I make decent money but I make much less than these dummies that can't see the true value of GameStop. They try to make a mockery of it. Money isn't funny and Ryan Cohen is about to make his investors a lot of money and these experts are so ignorant and arrogant that it's baffling. Tesla's PE ratio puts it at a $20 stock and it's trading above $600 on bad days just because of the potential. GameStop has a price target of $175 and currently valued around $20 and only trading at $191.50. What's going to happen when they hit that $175 price target and all these smug motherfuckers finally have to admit they were wrong after GameStop announces a much higher price target? Can't wait! Patience people. This is the best long term play there is even at these prices in my opinion.",
