    "selftext": "Hello my dear apes, I got an interesting idea to bring to you guys. I have finally gained not 1, not 2, but 3 wrinkles on my pinky brain.\n\nI did the number thingy and the result was pretty interesting.\n\nFirst we have to know some interesting numbers and facts.\n\nWhen we moon we will experience trading halts, lots of them. Don't worry it's pretty normal. It just takes longer to rise.\n\nA trading halt occurs when a stock shows high velocity in an extended amount of time. It varies from 5 minutes to 10 minutes respectively.\n\nA US trade day begins from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST, as we know. That is 390 minutes.\n\nImportant note: im not taking premarket into account. If i did the numbers would be Even greater. \n\nLet's assume that when MOASS happens it can be halted 39 to 78 times in a single trade day. I assume that it won't repeat 78 times in a single day, given that the stock has to trade and some people may or may not paperhand/daytrade/Nakedshorts in the process.\n\n(Due to new infomation the fair estimate a miximum amount of tradehalts can occour is 31,2 times, it's because the tradeing halt will occour within a 10% gain within 5 minuttes where it could halt between 5 to 10 minuttes.\n\nSo that is a repeating process. 5 minuttes tradeing, and 5 to 10 minuttes tradehalts. so about 31,2 tradehalts during a regular trade day, not takeing premarket into account. 390/12,5 = 31,2)\n\nLet's say we take a conservative estimation and say its 25 halts in a day.\n\nWhy 25? because following can happend:\n* some will sell\n* ladder attacks\n* glitches\n* huge volosity\n* tradeing halts on downticks\n\nNow is the time to bring you Vietnam flashbacks to the good ol\u2019 school days when we had exponential functions\u2026\n\nthe X-axis is each time a trade halts. So 1x = 1 halt. Let's go back and say one regular trade day is 25 halts. We now have a timeframe to work with.\n\nThe Y-axis is the value of GME in USD\n\nFormula:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The formula  i'm using is this one:](https://preview.redd.it/54sbuqn8y0r61.png?width=110&format=png&auto=webp&s=8191defc5e8a50ba255c2a240566cc0303dacca9)\n\n**A** is the current price of GME, let's say right now it's 200 USD.\n\n**B** is the rate that the price goes up.Lets say it's between 5 and 10 % increase before a tradeinghalt occurs, so 7.5%. so A is 1,075.\n\nthe equations is: f(x) = 200*1.075^x\n\n\nIt might just look like some funny letter numbers but it lead lead me to this picture:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[X= Halts 25 halts = 1 tradeing day       Y = Value of the stock](https://preview.redd.it/yd6qnt5fy0r61.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b66adf0a60e3aa734433f283ca73fa8cdc02a4a)\n\nIf we use Volkswagen as an example as a time frame we can say the squeeze will last 4 to 5 days. We know that GME has a longer duration since it is common knowledge that GME is shorted far more than Volkswagen.\n\nIt will probably last a couple of weeks in my opinion.\n\nSo what's **N**? **N** is the price of **1,686,894 USD** on day 5 when GME moons respectively.\n\nhere are some more numbers:\n\nDay 1: **1,219 USD**\n\nDay 2: **7,437 USD**\n\nDay 3: **45,359 USD**\n\n...\n\nDay 10:  **24,000,000,000  USD. (!!!)**\n\nTherefore i think it is entirely possible to reach 7 digits, heck maybe even 8 digits, when they are done covering, even when trading halts are taken into account.\n\n\nWhat is the takeaway? \n\n- we now know that it would be a bummer to sell on the way up at the first day of the squese. \n- Pay attention to this graph when we moon\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knplnb4ty0r61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9f51591038ac84329b852082067f05784920f50\n\nNot a financial advice, I just like the stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: Error in title. Sorry about that.\n\n**Edit2** im just a stupid monkey, take everything with a grain of salt, there Are many variables to take into account. Im a very visual orianted person, so i wanted to see how it would look when this playes out.\n\n**Edit 3** Here is what i Will work on\n\n- i want to figure out how long the squese Will last\n- i Will look into the nature of tradeing halts in the premarket\n- i Will look into prioer tradeing halts in the past regarding gme\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
