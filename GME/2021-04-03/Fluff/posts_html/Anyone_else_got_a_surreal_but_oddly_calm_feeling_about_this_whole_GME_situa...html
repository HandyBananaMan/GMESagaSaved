<p>I mean, this stock breaks all common sense in investing. Im averaging up as each day passes and i still feel its a bargain everytime i hit that sweet buy order button. 
Does this mean i have completed my evolution into a true ape?</p>
<p>Edit: 
This post is proof that apes together strong. 
Im really glad that this sparked such a conversation and hopefully gave you all a sense of calm after this weekends shill attacks.</p>
