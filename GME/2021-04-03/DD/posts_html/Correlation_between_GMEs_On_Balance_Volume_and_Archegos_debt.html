<p>FT today posted an article about Archegos' massive blow up that got some attention.  You can read a non-paywalled version of this article here:</p>

Katie Martin, Robin Wigglesworth and Laurence Fletcher.  FT 4-3-2021</a></p>
<p>Overall, the text of the article is pretty boring NPR-level filler.  But they did let slip one really cool piece of research.  This awesome chart:</p>

<p>This chart does a much better job of telling Archegos' story than the text.  Basically back in December, they were just a mild mannered HF minding their own business taking normal risks.  Then all of sudden <em>around mid-January</em>, Hwang goes off his meds and decides to destroy his company by <strong>taking out over $100 BILLION worth of debt</strong> over the course of the next 3 months.  <em>Now what else do we know that happened around mid-January....</em></p>
<p>So I saw this chart and decided to trace out the dots pixel-by-pixel to get at the real data, because obviously that's what any normal person would do...</p>

<p>Now I didn't get all the data points exactly right, but the curve reminds me of something I've seen before.  Take a look at GME's on balance volume:</p>

<p>The correlation between these two data sets is striking.  So I ripped out the data from microaxis and dumped them into a spread sheet.  Plotting them on top of each other, I got this:</p>

<p>I think there may be more relating Archegos and GME than is currently being discussed in the media. Perhaps the connections to Tiger, Melvin and GME should be investigated more carefully.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: u/UEAMatt has pointed out that Melvin has puts on some of the Archegos stocks https://fintel.io/so/us/gsx/melvin-capital-management-lp</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I got an r-value of 0.87, which I think is pretty high considering that I copied all these values from the screen by hand and there is probably quite a bit of noise/slop on the date axis.  Note that FT article's figure actually has March 21 written twice on the x-axis so I had to guess on the range.</p>
