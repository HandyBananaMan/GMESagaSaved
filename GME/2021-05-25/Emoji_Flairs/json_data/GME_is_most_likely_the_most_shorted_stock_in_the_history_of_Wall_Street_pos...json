    "selftext": "Sharing a good read from Yahoo Finance \nBarren Wuffett\n\nFor all the new GameStop investors: Welcome! \n\nGME is most likely the most shorted stock in the history of Wall Street, possibly as much as 2000%. \n\nThe hedgefunds has been hiding their shorts using synthetic shares, ETF's, dark-pools, etc. \n\nThe hedgefunds are using paid shills and bots (most likely based in India, judging by their most active hours) to trashtalk this stock 24/7. \n\nYou can spot a shill by looking at their constant insults/threats, lack of financial/informative data, copy-pasting, childish username, straight up fake news and gif-spamming. \n\nThe most important thing is to HOLD, don't daytrade or you risk being without shares once the inevitable short-squeeze starts, you would also be helping the hedgefunds postpone the inevitable short-squeeze. \n\nThe floor is $10,000,000/share. The hedgefunds has been ruining the market for years, it's time for payback. \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\n\n\nLink: \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/community?p=GME",
