For all the new GameStop investors: Welcome! 

GME is most likely the most shorted stock in the history of Wall Street, possibly as much as 2000%. 

The hedgefunds has been hiding their shorts using synthetic shares, ETF's, dark-pools, etc. 

The hedgefunds are using paid shills and bots (most likely based in India, judging by their most active hours) to trashtalk this stock 24/7. 

You can spot a shill by looking at their constant insults/threats, lack of financial/informative data, copy-pasting, childish username, straight up fake news and gif-spamming. 

The most important thing is to HOLD, don't daytrade or you risk being without shares once the inevitable short-squeeze starts, you would also be helping the hedgefunds postpone the inevitable short-squeeze. 

The floor is $10,000,000/share. The hedgefunds has been ruining the market for years, it's time for payback. 💎✋💎✋💎✋🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍🦍🦍🦍
