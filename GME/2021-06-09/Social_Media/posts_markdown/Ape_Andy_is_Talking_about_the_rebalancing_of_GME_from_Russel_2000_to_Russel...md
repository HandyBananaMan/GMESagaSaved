# Title: Ape Andy is Talking about the rebalancing of GME from Russel 2000 to Russel 1000. Alle shorted ETFs containing GME need to be closed. Andy says that the ETFs alone are 500% short. This will put rocket fuel buying pressure on GME! Can some wrinkle brain confirm? Sounds huge to me ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
