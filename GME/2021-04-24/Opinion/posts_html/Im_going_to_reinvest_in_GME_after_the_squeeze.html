<p>That's it. I like the stock, I like how they pulled a new opportunity from a really bad situation and closed a period with benefits and no debs during a pandemic. They have the talent and the means to make a profitable company, a really good one, in the long run.
This is not about the squeeze only, it's about to get more and give back. </p>
<p>We like the stock</p>
