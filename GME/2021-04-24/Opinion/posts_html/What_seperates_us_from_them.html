<p>Hi All.</p>
<p>Do you know what seperates us from them?</p>
<p>About 6 months ago, I moved into a new house. Fast foward to this day, I had not met any of my neighbours... until last night. I was at my computer when I heard a knock on the front door. It was my elderly neighbour... Pete.</p>
<p>Pete asked if I was good with technology, since I am a young ape, and that he was having trouble with his chrome cast. Without batting an eye lid, I offered to come and help, "Sure, let me come over and help you" I said.</p>
<p>I went to his house and he led me to the TV in the master bedroom. In the bedroom, his wife was in bed, waiting for Pete to fix the chromecast. As I entered I introduced myself and asked how I could help. They were just having an issue with the Chromecast not displaying their show... it was a simple fix. I made sure I showed them what I was doing and explained the issue as simply as I could so that they could fix it themselves if it happened again in the future. I also left them my mobile number so they could ring or text me at anytime if they need help again.</p>
<p>I stayed for about 15 minutes talking to this lovley old couple who had been married for over 40 years. They were talking about their life together and that recently she has been bed ridden because she needs a hip replacement, that they can't afford. Roughly about $150,000.</p>
<p>This is what seperates us from them.</p>
<p>The second I heard that, I knew that I would pay for that surgery after the squeeze. When the tendies come, no matter how many I get, I know that I can help, and that I should.</p>
<p>We aren't greedy. We aren't selfish. We have compassion. We care about other people. We care about people who we don't even know.</p>
<p>THEY DON'T</p>
<p>That what seperates us from them. We want to help people, they want to help themselves.</p>
<p>We are as a human race have the inate ability to want to do good, but the world has been perverted into a machine to trap people and rob them of their life, so they have no choice but to obsess about material money and the idea that they need to work to have a life.</p>
<p>Work is not an aid to life, work is an obstacle to life.  </p>
