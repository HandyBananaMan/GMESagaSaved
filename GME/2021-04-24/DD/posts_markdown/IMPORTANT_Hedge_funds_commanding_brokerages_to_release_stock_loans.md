Alright, I hope you take the time to read this and share your thoughts.

I'm an Interactive Brokers user and just checked my inbox today to see that I am eligible for a 'Stock Yield Enhancement Program' (SYEP). Basically, the premise is that you can loan your shares (assuming they are highly demanded) to your brokerage and then they will loan it to clients (individuals, corporations etc.). While your shares are being loaned, you will receive interest and can see the interest rate that you're being paid on the collateral (U.S. treasury or cash). You still have ownership of the stock and therefore possess **risk**, should you recognize any profits or losses. You can sell shares at any time and terminate participation in the program.

First off, I found this to be quite fishy. For instance, why was I just recently messaged about this? Are other brokerages doing the same thing? Why would I, the lender, still possess complete risk?

As a GME shareholder, the obvious speculation for me is that it has to do with hedge funds attempting to continue shorting in order to keep share prices low and thus encourage a sell-off. 2 BIG REASONS why this is sus (IBKR even said so in their info page about SYEP)

1. Loaned shares are "typically used to facilitate short positions". No surprise that, with growing speculation of a short squeeze, hedge funds that have heavily shorted GME (and have already lost tons of money) are desperately trying to keep the price low by continuing to short. Moral of the story: MY SHARES ARE NOT FOR SALE
2. "Voting rights go to the **borrower**". THIS is not a joke. Word for word: *"During any period in which your securities are loaned out, you will forfeit your right to vote those shares by proxy"*. GME's proxy votes are due soon and loaning shares would forfeit your ability as a shareholder to participate in these votes, handing it over to the hedge funds trying to short. Outrageous.

Not much to say other than this seems like another attempt to manipulate the market and re-*un*balance the distribution of power. Hedge funds know they're gonna get margin called soon and want to do everything they can to suppress the vitality and vigor of retail investors, even going as far as to influence our very own brokerages (shouldn't be a surprise, though, considering what happened a few months ago when buy orders of 'high-volatility stocks' were halted).

Why are brokerages collaborating with these hedge funds? We can't say for certain why. There may be corrupt boards involved, but the most likely and obvious reason is that, if a massive short squeeze were to happen, brokerages and commercial banks definitely do not have the necessary liquidity to cover the astronomical profits GME shareholders would be making. Thus, they're siding with hedge funds to try and keep the share price low to avoid a complete market crash.

Hope this post gave you some insight  ðŸ’ª

Edit/**TLDR**: If not conveyed obviously enough, don't participate in these stock loan programs! And make sure you read the rules of the trade first if you ever get a notification about these programs from your broker; "Stock Yield Enhancement Program" sure sounds good till I actually read what it was about. **My shares are not for sale or borrowing!**

Edit 2: Are hedge funds trying to borrow shares to cover, or to short? I think it's to *short* \- I don't see how you could cover existing short positions with more borrowed stock, it doesn't make any sense. That's why my verdict is that signing up for these stock yield programs would most likely result in hedge funds borrowing your shares to initiate *more short positions* in order to drive the current stock price down. This would minimize their losses by the time they're forced to cover all their short positions, and is why you want to ensure your shares aren't being **lent.**
