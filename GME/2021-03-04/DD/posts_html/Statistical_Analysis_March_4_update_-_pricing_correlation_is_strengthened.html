<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I posted this about half an hour ago but the post was removed for some reason. I'm guessing it was because I didn't have a strong enough disclaimer? I was in a rush to post, so please note this is not meant to be financial advice, but rather continued discussion around the correlation between the January run-up and our current (apparent) run-up.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx4gbv/yall_this_is_statistically_significant_action/">the post I made after market close yesterday</a>, below are the numbers that include today's pricing.</p>
<p>Here's my input data for calculating ~~Spearmint Rhino~~ Spearman's Rho:</p>
<p><img alt="Between my original post and this re-post attempt, I was able to adjust the closing price and final volume for today's activity." src="https://preview.redd.it/m8vo9iev33l61.png?width=1211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=433c468a043089c8bfb64a4ae7d90ed27731fd4b" /></p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<ul>
<li>For the test comparing closing prices in the January run-up (January 6 to January 28) and our current run-up (February 17 to the present): Spearman's <em>œÅ</em> = <strong>0.95804</strong>, p-value (2-tailed) = <strong>0</strong>. This is an <em>even stronger</em> correlation compared to yesterday's Spearman's <em>œÅ</em> = 0.9455 and p-value (2-tailed) of \~0.00001</li>
<li>For the test comparing volume between the same date ranges: Spearman's <em>œÅ</em> = <strong>0.67832</strong>, p-value (2-tailed) = <strong>0.01532</strong>. This is a reduced correlation compared to yesterday's Spearman's <em>œÅ</em> = 0.7364 and p-value (2-tailed) = 0.00976</li>
</ul>
<p>In graph form:</p>
<p><img alt="Today's price increase continues the trend from January's run-up, further increasing the correlation between data sets." src="https://preview.redd.it/v4pk4q0o43l61.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ccb11d49af250c768a4bc088dece68f5ed62e9d" /></p>
<p><img alt="Volume remained low, creating a deviation from the pattern seen in January. As such, correlation was somewhat reduced." src="https://preview.redd.it/6onw918x43l61.png?width=942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=475fafdd94d386d0e3ff6a964fe08e2ad76dc660" /></p>
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>While we ended the day at a higher price, therefore continuing the pattern from the first run-up (to the point where the p-value is <strong>bloody* zero!</strong>), the jump was not as dramatic as the change from January 21 to January 22. This should not be a surprise, as volume remained relatively low today. See my post from this morning for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxhatz/some_additional_thoughts_on_statistical_analysis/">expanded notes</a> (particularly at the end, addressing volume).</p>
<p><em>*</em> <em>I try to write in a straight-forward manner, but it needs to be said: this is amazing to witness. We in effect have two date ranges in which the following occurred:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Relatively flat prices from Day 1 to 5 (inclusive)</em></li>
<li><em>A dramatic jump occurs on Day 6 (from $19.95 to $31.40 in Set A and from $44.97 to $91.71 in Set B)</em></li>
<li><em>An increase from Day 6 to Day 7</em></li>
<li><em>A slight decrease from Day 7 to Day 8</em></li>
<li><em>An increase from Day 8 to 9</em></li>
<li><em>A slight decrease from Day 9 to 10</em></li>
<li><em>An increase from Day 10 to 11</em></li>
<li><em>Another increase from Day 11 to 12; we spent most of March 4 in the red but in the end, the price recovered and then exceeded its previous close</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The practically zero p-value is to say: <strong>this shouldn't happen based on chance alone</strong>.</p>
<p>See you at Spearmint Rhino when this is all over.</p>
