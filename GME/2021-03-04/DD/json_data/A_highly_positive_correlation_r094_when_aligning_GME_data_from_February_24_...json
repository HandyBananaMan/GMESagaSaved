    "selftext": "Hello again my fellow apes \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d!\n\n**BOILERPLATE:**\n\nI still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\\-----\n\n**UPDATE: THIS MODEL CORRECTLY PREDICTED THE RALLY TODAY!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nI found a VERY interesting correlation if we line up the rally we saw on February 24, with the rally on January 13! As you will see below, **I calculated the correlation to be 0.9**4, which is considered a very high correlation.\n\nIt looks like history may be repeating itself and if true, we c**ould see significant share price increases over the next 5 days.** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\\------\n\n**The data**\n\nI used two types of data for this analysis:\n\n1. I used FINRA daily short volume ([obtained here](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-February.html)) and divided by the total number of outstanding GME shares (69.75 million) to get the % of Total Shares that were involved in short volume. If you want to see more about this calculation and the raw data, you can check out my earlier posts ([post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lw2a06/finra_data_now_shows_over_68_million_gme_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltcdf5/finra_data_now_shows_over_67_million_gme_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [post 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [post 4 \\[most recent](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx9ut2/finra_data_now_shows_only_28_million_gme_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\])\n2. I calculated the absolute % change in share price vs the day before. [Data was extracted from yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME).) A reminder that absolute numbers are always positive. The reason for using absolute is that it is harder to visualize the trend when the bars go both ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n    Formula used: absolute((today\u2019s close \u2013 yesterday\u2019s close) / yesterdays close) \n\n**Here is the raw data and calculations:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/46817nevp1l61.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1061bd981ee28299890354a597215effcf465e3\n\n\\------\n\n**The Trends**\n\nAfter graphing this data, I saw that there could be a similar trend seen at February 24 and January 13.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0lgdrutp1l61.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91a4b7614480a17432ba71e1d0f73f422d0ac83\n\nTo see if this was true, I aligned the two dates so that **Day 1 = January 4 and February 12** and the spikes seen above in yellow were aligned for **Day 8** (January 13 & February 24). **We are currently at Day 12 and the rally up to $350 occurs on Day 17.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd3u3hxrp1l61.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eb37f2159ec4dba41d3ba710b2e3771a9538823\n\n\\------\n\n**Correlation of the data**\n\nThe **correlation** between the red and blue absolute % stock price change lines for Day 1 to 12 is **r= 0.94 which is considered a very high correlation**! A reminder that 1.0 is considered to be perfectly correlated and 0 is considered no correlation.\n\nWhile the short volume % of total stock is not considered correlated, the sustained increase in the amount of short volume seen during Day 9-10 in Feb vs Jan could be a sign that institutions are trying as hard as they can to drop the share price to try and stop this trend.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/extfsk8xp1l61.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=58c9fbb5459480aea957a4ca6cb7cc6fb8a362c2\n\n**If this correlation continues, then we should expect the red line to follow the blue and see significant price rallies within the next week. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\n\\-----\n\n**TLDR: History seems to be repeating itself (with a 0.94 confidence) and we could see huge rallies in in the next week! \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\n\\-----\n\nPs., I\u2019ve been told my posts have too many words so I put together some \u2018Aliens\u2019 memes to summarize the current situation. Enjoy \ud83d\ude09\n\n[Part 1: They are at the price ceiling.

Thanks to [u/tri\\_fire\\_engineer](https://www.reddit.com/u/tri_fire_engineer/) for bringing this up last time and sending me the full data. **It actually** **showed that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t\n* **Daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other things that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month but that\u2019s no fun at all!",
