Hi all,

I posted this about half an hour ago but the post was removed for some reason. I'm guessing it was because I didn't have a strong enough disclaimer? I was in a rush to post, so please note this is not meant to be financial advice, but rather continued discussion around the correlation between the January run-up and our current (apparent) run-up.

\---

Based on [the post I made after market close yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx4gbv/yall_this_is_statistically_significant_action/), below are the numbers that include today's pricing.

Here's my input data for calculating ~~Spearmint Rhino~~ Spearman's Rho:

[Between my original post and this re-post attempt, I was able to adjust the closing price and final volume for today's activity.](https://preview.redd.it/m8vo9iev33l61.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=433c468a043089c8bfb64a4ae7d90ed27731fd4b)

# Results

* For the test comparing closing prices in the January run-up (January 6 to January 28) and our current run-up (February 17 to the present): Spearman's *œÅ* = **0.95804**, p-value (2-tailed) = **0**. This is an *even stronger* correlation compared to yesterday's Spearman's *œÅ* = 0.9455 and p-value (2-tailed) of \~0.00001
* For the test comparing volume between the same date ranges: Spearman's *œÅ* = **0.67832**, p-value (2-tailed) = **0.01532**. This is a reduced correlation compared to yesterday's Spearman's *œÅ* = 0.7364 and p-value (2-tailed) = 0.00976

In graph form:

[Today's price increase continues the trend from January's run-up, further increasing the correlation between data sets.](https://preview.redd.it/v4pk4q0o43l61.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ccb11d49af250c768a4bc088dece68f5ed62e9d)

[Volume remained low, creating a deviation from the pattern seen in January. As such, correlation was somewhat reduced.](https://preview.redd.it/6onw918x43l61.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=475fafdd94d386d0e3ff6a964fe08e2ad76dc660)

# Analysis

While we ended the day at a higher price, therefore continuing the pattern from the first run-up (to the point where the p-value is **bloody\* zero!**), the jump was not as dramatic as the change from January 21 to January 22. This should not be a surprise, as volume remained relatively low today. See my post from this morning for ![expanded notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxhatz/some_additional_thoughts_on_statistical_analysis/) (particularly at the end, addressing volume).

*\** *I try to write in a straight-forward manner, but it needs to be said: this is amazing to witness. We in effect have two date ranges in which the following occurred:*

* *Relatively flat prices from Day 1 to 5 (inclusive)*
* *A dramatic jump occurs on Day 6 (from $19.95 to $31.40 in Set A and from $44.97 to $91.71 in Set B)*
* *An increase from Day 6 to Day 7*
* *A slight decrease from Day 7 to Day 8*
* *An increase from Day 8 to 9*
* *A slight decrease from Day 9 to 10*
* *An increase from Day 10 to 11*
* *Another increase from Day 11 to 12; we spent most of March 4 in the red but in the end, the price recovered and then exceeded its previous close*

The practically zero p-value is to say: **this shouldn't happen based on chance alone**.

See you at Spearmint Rhino when this is all over.
