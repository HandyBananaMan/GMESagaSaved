He gets hurt at work, tries to shrug it off, but can't.  
They send him to doctors who tell him he suffered loss of consciousness from his fall and his short term memory is gone and his back is permanently damaged.  
Over the next five years, he's sent to every specialist in a 300 mile radius.  
They all find the same thing and demand specific treatments.  
The state denies those treatments and sends him for more tests.  
This repeats every month while his brain and body get worse.  
He finally gets a lawyer and they fight for the specialist-demanded treatments.  
The state weasels out of the demands and require him to do yet more tests to find anything at all they can blame things on.  
The state throws out his case on a technicality because "no one saw it happen" despite specific evidence he was injured where when and how his doctors say he was injured.  
The feds throw out his social security claim on a technicality because he simultaneously didn't make enough and also made too much to qualify.  
And now, I have the one chance of my lifetime to have enough money to get him those treatments everyone else has denied him.  


So I'm holding. I won't sell at 100k. Hold with me for the moon, because at least this one broken person depends on it.  


Not financial advice.  
Never get hurt at work. No one is going to help you.
