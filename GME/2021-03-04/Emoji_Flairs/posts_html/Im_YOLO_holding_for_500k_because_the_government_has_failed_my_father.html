<p>He gets hurt at work, tries to shrug it off, but can't.<br />
They send him to doctors who tell him he suffered loss of consciousness from his fall and his short term memory is gone and his back is permanently damaged.<br />
Over the next five years, he's sent to every specialist in a 300 mile radius.<br />
They all find the same thing and demand specific treatments.<br />
The state denies those treatments and sends him for more tests.<br />
This repeats every month while his brain and body get worse.<br />
He finally gets a lawyer and they fight for the specialist-demanded treatments.<br />
The state weasels out of the demands and require him to do yet more tests to find anything at all they can blame things on.<br />
The state throws out his case on a technicality because "no one saw it happen" despite specific evidence he was injured where when and how his doctors say he was injured.<br />
The feds throw out his social security claim on a technicality because he simultaneously didn't make enough and also made too much to qualify.<br />
And now, I have the one chance of my lifetime to have enough money to get him those treatments everyone else has denied him.  </p>
<p>So I'm holding. I won't sell at 100k. Hold with me for the moon, because at least this one broken person depends on it.  </p>
<p>Not financial advice.<br />
Never get hurt at work. No one is going to help you.</p>
