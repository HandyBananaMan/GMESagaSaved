    "selftext": "He gets hurt at work, tries to shrug it off, but can't.  \nThey send him to doctors who tell him he suffered loss of consciousness from his fall and his short term memory is gone and his back is permanently damaged.  \nOver the next five years, he's sent to every specialist in a 300 mile radius.  \nThey all find the same thing and demand specific treatments.  \nThe state denies those treatments and sends him for more tests.  \nThis repeats every month while his brain and body get worse.  \nHe finally gets a lawyer and they fight for the specialist-demanded treatments.  \nThe state weasels out of the demands and require him to do yet more tests to find anything at all they can blame things on.  \nThe state throws out his case on a technicality because \"no one saw it happen\" despite specific evidence he was injured where when and how his doctors say he was injured.  \nThe feds throw out his social security claim on a technicality because he simultaneously didn't make enough and also made too much to qualify.  \nAnd now, I have the one chance of my lifetime to have enough money to get him those treatments everyone else has denied him.  \n\n\nSo I'm holding. I won't sell at 100k. Hold with me for the moon, because at least this one broken person depends on it.  \n\n\nNot financial advice.  \nNever get hurt at work. No one is going to help you.",
