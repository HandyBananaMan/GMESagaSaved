The screenshot above is from a tweet they released recently.CNBC article writes:  
"The firm said in [late January that it closed out its GameStop shorts as the stock climbed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html). Melvin’s founder, Gabe Plotkin, was one of the people brought in to testify before Congress about the volatile market moves, along with Citadel’s Ken Griffin"
