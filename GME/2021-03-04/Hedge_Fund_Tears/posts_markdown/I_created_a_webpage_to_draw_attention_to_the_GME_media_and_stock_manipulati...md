On Wednesday I created and shared [**https://gmetruth.com/**](https://gmetruth.com/) \- a one page overview of what's going on with GME, written in a way someone who has only seen mainstream media reports would understand and hosted on a standalone webpage so that it's easily accessible outside of Reddit.

Since yesterday evening the site has been getting increasing amounts of traffic (as in 10's of thousands) and I noticed earlier that there are attempts to access files which are used for PHP, SQL and Wordpress exploits, hundreds of hits from a series of single IP addresses in quick succession (*maybe* someone trying to cause a DDOS outage) - i.e take down the website.

Jokes on whoever is trying to take the site down though, it's a single page raw code website and has no exploitable code, because I'm a smooth brained ape, and I don't know what a Wordpress is.

**TLDR:** It appears that nefarious actors are trying to censor content that would challenge the media narrative which exists outside of Reddit and ~~could potentially go~~ is slowing going viral.

**Developers Note:**

*Guys, this is not a circle jerk about how many hits your 'private server' gets each day, nor on the mechanics of DDOS, XSS, injections or any other kind of web/server based exploit. The point of this post is to illuminate odd activity which stands out from any other website or server I have managed over several years. There's no claim here that I know this is deliberate, simply that the error logs look suspect.*
