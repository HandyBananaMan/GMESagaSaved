    "selftext": "You wake up, do your stuff, go to work (if you have one), get busy. Finally you give a quick look at the price... 500, need to finish the stuff first, you can't ignore it, you give a second look... 1000. You are so excited you're shivering cause you knew this moment had to come. You start reading the DDs and comments on Reddit, many apes are scared that \"some people will sell and f* up the rocket\" then you quickly check the price, 900, 800, 700... you check Reddit and read comments like \"some paper hands piece of shills are selling\", you start believing it, you check the price once again and... 500, 400, 300. You sell some shares out of desperation. 200, 100, 50. You contributed to have f*ed up the rocket, you sell all of your shares and officially become a paper handed bish, you will never have an opportunity like this ever again, your family will never see that helpful money, you will have to work for the rest of your life and finally die poor. \n\nNice story, ah?\n\nNow, let me tell you the other side of this story...\n\nYou wake up, do your stuff, go to work, get busy. You look at the price every second, 200, 500, 1000. You  knew this moment had to come but you're ready, you're being paid to be ready. You start reading the DDs and comments on Reddit, you and your colleagues start commenting stuff like \"some people will sell and f* up the rocket\", you and your colleagues sell thousands of shares, you quickly check the price, 900, 800, 700... you're not stressed, everything is going the way you hoped, you and your colleagues go to Reddit and post comments like \"some paper hands piece of shills are selling\", you and your colleagues sell thousands of shares, you wait some time for apes to start believing those comments, you check the price once again and... 500, 400, 300. You and your colleagues sell thousands of shares, you hope apes will give up and sell some shares out of desperation. 200, 100, 50. You know it worked, you contributed to have f*ed up the rocket, you couldn't be more proud of yourself, apes are selling all of their shares and officially become paper handed bishes. Your work day has ended, you congratulate with your colleagues and get the money, you are happy you destroyed the dreams and lives of millions of people who wanted to make the world a better place. You exit the Citadel building knowing millions of people are now crying cause of you.\n\n^ That's... The other side of the story.\n\n\n\nThey will try to convince you that some are selling, that they'll stop the rocket. THEY WILL SELL THOUSANDS OF SHARES TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN. How much down? 0 is and has always been their target.\n\nIt's not a matter of time, it's a matter of strength. At one point you'll believe some paper hands are selling, at some point you'll question yourself why didn't you sell before...\n\nThe key is to have faith in the good which is intrinsic in the apes, no matter if you think some apes will sell, faith is faith. You're not reaching a destination, you're just moving towards it, you gotta be water to reshape yourself and dodge the FUD, FOMO and other techniques we don't even know about.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf0a",
