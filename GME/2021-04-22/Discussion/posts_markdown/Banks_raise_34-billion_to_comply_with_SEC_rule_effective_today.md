OK, so there has been a lot of misinformation about the banks being required to have cash on hand to cover the value of their loaned securities. Many people said it's just a suggestion because of the no-action letter that went out October 22nd, 2020. That letter absolutely was something the SEC wasn't going to punish the Hedge Funds for THEN. But it did set a deadline for when they would begin recommending action be taken, and that date is today.

One of the important things that I don't know if enough people realize is, the requirements to have collateral on hand to cover the value of loaned securities isn't just a one time deal for today, but it is something that has to be adjusted every day based on the price of the stock.

So all of these banks went on a massive bond selling spree to raise capital for this, but if the share prices of GME and other heavily shorted stocks go up, their requirements for reserve capital also go up. They can't sell bonds every week just to keep covering this, that would be suspicious to the general public.

I'm not making the prediction that this is it, but it's the first thing in a while that doesn't take any imagination to see how it could lead to margin calls.

As always, take this info with a grain of salt and come to your own conclusion. I just wanted people to be able to think about it.
