<p>Check out page 33-34. "The total number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of April 15, 2021 was 70,771,778."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/030703.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/030703.asp</a> explains how the float relates to the number of outstanding shares. Footnotes (9)-(21) on page 34 explains the total number of restricted shares. Footnote (21) states the total number of restricted shares for board members and directors = 2,128,634. Subtracting this from the number of outstanding shares, we have: 68,643,144 shares in the float.</p>
<p>Institutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>BlackRock, Inc. - 9,217,335 shares</li>
<li>RC Ventures LLC - 9,001,000 shares</li>
<li>The Vanguard Group - 5,162,095 shares</li>
<li>Senvest Management, LLC - 5,050,915 shares</li>
<li>Maverick Capital, Ltd. - 4,658,607 shares</li>
<li>Susquehanna Fundamental Investments, LLC - 4,409,467 shares</li>
<li>Dimensional Fund Advisors LP - 3,934,919 shares</li>
<li>u/DeepFuckingValue - 200,000 Shares</li>
</ol>
<p>We get a total of: 41,634,338 shares owned by these <em>seven</em> institutions (plus a legendary non-cat).</p>
<p>This gives us a float of: 27,008,806 shares excluding these seven institutions (and non-cat legend). There are about 205,000 people in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/">r/Superstonk</a>. If everyone owned ~~132.73~~ 131.75 shares on average (which is probably close to true), then we would own all additional float...and then some. This doesn't even account for all ~~DFV shares and~~ other smaller institutions who have a long position. There you have it folks...my bias is sore because its tits have been jacked for so long.</p>
<p>This got removed from r/Superstonk because of Karma requirements...</p>
<p>Edit 1: Edited to include DFV by popular demand.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Shout out to u/Toomanykidstosupport for bringing this to my attention. Footnote (4) regarding Vanguard shares states that" The Vanguard Group has the sole power to vote or to direct the vote with respect to 0 of these shares..." So they would have to have recalled all of their shares to vote. There must be a strategic reason as to why they chose not to recall their shares. My personal opinion, which is not supported by any evidence, is that Vanguard is a neutral party who would stand to profit from the squeeze indirectly through our gains (via increased customer base, which will increase their AUM).</p>
<p>Edit 3: Well, as I typed this from my desk at my shitty job that I just can't wait to quit, I had not expected this to get much past 20 upvotes. Needless to say, I am inspired by every ape's excitement, dedication, and pious use of rocket emojis. I have been trying to address questions/concerns in the comments, but judging by how many emails I have received from Reddit in the past hour, that isn't going to be possible. Instead, I will make edits to reflect the many people who had similar concerns/questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>This post was not intended to try to estimate the percentage of the float that retail holds. I only used a simple average. My reasoning was that there is a population of retail investors who own GME. r/Superstonk is a subset of that population. So, the average number of shares required to be owned per subscriber of r/Superstonk was means to be interpreted as an upper-bound for the average number of shares needed per ape.</li>
<li>A lot of people say that 131.75 is an outlandish assumption and that the average is nowhere close to that. I disagree. And that is okay. Averages are misleading. I would say that the median number of shares among r/Superstonk is probably low xx. The mode is probably low xx or maybe even x. If you have one ape who owns 1,000 shares, two apes who own 100 shares, and 10 apes who own 1 share, the <strong>average</strong> is 93.08 shares. This can be very misleading, but given that it was meant to be interpreted as an upper-bound, I don't think that's entirely fair.</li>
<li>I appreciate all of you that have reached out offering links to other information about institutional ownership. The point of this post, however, was to ignore all of that. I am saying that if we consider this one document, put together by the company which knows that any non-institutional reader of the proxy document will be an ape and has every reason to be as objective as possible, this is what we have. That is, <strong>if we ignore everything else, look at these fucking numbers</strong>. That, my friends, is the point.</li>
<li>With all of that in mind, the only reason that I chose the r/Superstonk number was because that was what was most immediately available when I was initially writing this as a comment in that sub. Replace r/Superstonk sample with r/GME or r/WSB, or whatever you want. The conclusion is still the same. HF r fuk and they will only ever be fuk as long as they don't somehow convince us that we are losing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit 4: If you are here to comment about the average that I calculated, please see the above comment.</p>
