    "selftext": "I'm seeing a load of people saying market buy. This helps SHF like citadel. Dave Lauer explained this in a superstonk video 2 months ago. Highly recommended : https://youtu.be/AYct0XX0uTU\n\nEdit : 44.00 minutes in, \"brokers will send limit orders to exchanges \"\n\nEdit : Context on a market structure 27:00 onwards. \n\nIf you buy using a market order then your broker has a legal obligation to find \"best execution\" this means they will look for the cheapest overall option for you - this results in using PFOF as they are cheaper than the exchange. (Unless your broker is IEX - but most aren't)\n\nPFOF is bad! Your money may go to citadel and a darkpool, then they can use your money to short another share negatively impacting price. It gives them ammunition!\n\nBut if you use limit order, then it is more likely to go to the exchange!  Market buying does not push the price up.  \n\nSo ...\n\nTLDR if you are buying today use a limit buy option.",
