Maybe old news, but the upvotes on these are ridiculously low for such amazing information that it implies to me that they haven't been well seen. I know I never saw them and I never see **NFT merchandise** being mentioned.

Those DDs perfectly spell out the same conclusion I came to this morning. GameStop will have it's own marketplace to trade all things gaming/ tech/ geek culture-related NFT's with **GME tokens**.

The very first GME token traded was with "[Gods Unchained](https://etherscan.io/address/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e#tokentxnsErc721)", a card game that uses NFT playing cards. It being the first one shows what RC's vision is. The second one is CryptoKitties. Probably a nod to DFV, but also it shows they are moving past gaming and **physical merchandise**, but into **NFT merchandise**.

Trading NFTs and crypto are confusing enough for the average person. GameStop is going to simplify it and turn it mainstream.

I'm so bullish and zen now more than ever.

Edit: I want to clarify by adding, this may or may not be a catalyst for MOASS. We should know better than to try and pinpoint it by now lol. RC is playing 4D chess and many of us, myself included, are just now picking up the rule book. Learning pretty fast though if I do say so myself.

This is simply just good news for the company overall. GameStop wants to be the Amazon of the tech industry? It's moves like this that prove that bull thesis. This is not the same company as back in January. 

Edit 2: Expounding on what you would trade the token for and adding a NFT ELI5 video.

Think of this as the diablo or WoW marketplace, but with real currency and no risk of duping.

NFTs such as in game content: character skins, digital artwork, digital Pok√©mon cards, digital real estate for  online social games, etc. The skys the limit.

Bought a skin but no longer want it? Put it on the Gamespot marketplace and see what you can get for it.

Need to complete your card deck with a specific card? Lucky you, somebody just listed it.

Claim rights to GTA-Online real estate. People will be flexing in their digital online mansion with their Mooncat wall art after a driving session in their digital Lambo.
