<p>Title says pretty much everything. The fact how fraudelent US stock market is and manipulation that happens in bright daylight is outrageous. I also belive I wont be the only one, they messed with whole new generation of millenials who taken on ivesting recently and realized how this game is rigged and controlled from the top to bottom. Who wants to play in game where if you winning mods change the rules? yeah fuck that. I suggest you Ameritards to look for some 401ks alternatives, keep your pensions away from Wall St!</p>
