<p>Before reading this, I highly recommend watching this video (only 13 minutes):</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pRHwhvUc54A">Ryan Grim And Wall St Whistleblower Claim Banks Engaged In SYSTEMIC FRAUD In Commercial Real Estate</a></p>
<p>So I was scrolling through the abyss of YouTube and came across this video that was posted on <strong>April 20th</strong> this year. After watching it I was both shocked but also <strong>JACKED TO THE TITS!</strong></p>
<p>Basically, Ryan Grim and whistleblower John Flynn explain that banks have resorted to the same tactics used in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, but are doing it through the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Market (CMBS).</p>
<p>From what I understand from the video, the lenders (banks) are massively inflating income from commercial properties (retailers) on their documentation, before selling the mortgages on the CMBS market at a higher price. This causes the buyers of these mortgages to think they are legitimate when in fact, the income from these properties can be nowhere near what the banks recorded on their documentation.</p>
<p>Grim says that this is great for everyone involved, <strong>AS LONG AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW AND REAL ESTATE PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE.</strong></p>
<p>I think that is the most important statement of this entire video and also where I think $GME starts to come into play.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, we have seen a huge increase in banks raising liquidity while at the same time the SEC is investigating naked short selling in hedge funds as related to the January $GME short squeeze. Why do banks need the liquidity you might ask? Because they know that overleveraged hedge funds are on the verge of being exposed and are likely to be margin-called in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>"But the economy is at all-time highs, tech is booming", and that is exactly the problem.</strong></p>
<p>If Citadel or other large hedge funds begin to fail, we are going to start seeing a massive sell-off in tech and the entire market in general. A massive market sell-off could cause investors to move to real estate, but wait, the CMBS mortgage prices are massively overinflated and nobody knows about it right now, then what happens? Well, I don't know for sure, but <strong>I think it would be pretty fucked.</strong></p>
<p>I also believe that there is a possibility that banks may have been doing this for a while now, but the problem probably became much worse in the last year with COVID forcing almost all retailers to shut down, seizing income. In order to find buyers of these commercial mortgages for retailers that were shut down by COVID and otherwise unattractive to investors, why not inflate their income now to find a buyer for the mortgage, COVID isn't gonna last forever, the businesses will recover eventually and no one will find out, as long as the market keeps growing, right?</p>
<p>WRONG. VERY WRONG. What if hedge funds expose themselves to massive risk through naked shorting and are forced to sell all of their positions to cover themselves? That would be a problem.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if the bubble that the market is in right now is a result of the fraud committed by lenders massively overinflating retailer incomes in the CMBS market during COVID and $GME is the catalyst to expose the short squeeze 2.0 after hedge funds are margin-called, triggering a broad market sell-off of all stocks?</em></strong></p>
<p>If my wild, smooth-brained, crayon-fueled conspiracy theory is even somewhat true, I think we apes may have uncovered something much deeper than GameStop, a scary possibility that the entire house of cards may fall right before our eyes.</p>
<p>This could be worse than 2008 and I think that is the scariest part. Nobody was held accountable for the criminality committed on Wall Street in 2008, so why should we expect that they learned their lesson? They clearly just moved the same tactics to a different type of security and are probably doing the exact same thing again.</p>
<p>You can't teach an old dog new tricks, so why should we expect hedgies and Wall St to play by the rules when they have broken them time and time again with no consequences? We can't.</p>
<p>Please give the video a watch, it is only at 177K views and I do not believe that it has been getting the attention it deserves. This could be huge.</p>
<p>TLDR: no, just read it you fuck.</p>
<p>Edit TLDR: <strong>There is a strong possibility that the same tactics that caused the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis are being used in the same way in the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Market currently, and a $GME short squeeze that potentially crashes the stock market could spill over to the real estate market, eventually exposing fraudulent over-inflation of retailer income in the CMBS market in commercial properties reported by lenders (banks), ultimately leading to distrust in the entire American economy as we know it, leading to an inevitable recession with increasing retail investor distrust in the efficiency of our supposed "free markets".</strong></p>
