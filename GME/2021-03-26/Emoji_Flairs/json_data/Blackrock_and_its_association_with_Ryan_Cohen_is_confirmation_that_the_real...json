Allows Ryan Cohen to have majority vote to continue GameStop\u2019s transformation.\n\n2. By allowing #1, stock will go up, which will increase Blackrock\u2019s profits.\n\n3. They will have loyal customers for life = stock goes up = Blackrock profits\n\n4. Take out Citadel as revenge, remove a competitor from the market, and take their customers = profit.\n\nThis was the ultimate confirmation bias I\u2019ve ever read and truly believe the squeeze will happen after knowing who our whale is. Get ready for our juicy tendies, apes!\n\nApe strong, diamond hands, GME Forever \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
