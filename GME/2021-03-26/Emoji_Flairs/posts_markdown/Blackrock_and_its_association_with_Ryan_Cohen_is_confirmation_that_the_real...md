Why they won’t pull the rug and continue to hold through the MOASS?

1. Allows Ryan Cohen to have majority vote to continue GameStop’s transformation.

2. By allowing #1, stock will go up, which will increase Blackrock’s profits.

3. They will have loyal customers for life = stock goes up = Blackrock profits

4. Take out Citadel as revenge, remove a competitor from the market, and take their customers = profit.

This was the ultimate confirmation bias I’ve ever read and truly believe the squeeze will happen after knowing who our whale is. Get ready for our juicy tendies, apes!

Ape strong, diamond hands, GME Forever 🚀💎🙌🏻
