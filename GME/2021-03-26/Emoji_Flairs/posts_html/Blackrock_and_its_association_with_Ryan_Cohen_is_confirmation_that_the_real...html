<p>Why they won’t pull the rug and continue to hold through the MOASS?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allows Ryan Cohen to have majority vote to continue GameStop’s transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By allowing #1, stock will go up, which will increase Blackrock’s profits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will have loyal customers for life = stock goes up = Blackrock profits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take out Citadel as revenge, remove a competitor from the market, and take their customers = profit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This was the ultimate confirmation bias I’ve ever read and truly believe the squeeze will happen after knowing who our whale is. Get ready for our juicy tendies, apes!</p>
<p>Ape strong, diamond hands, GME Forever 🚀💎🙌🏻</p>
