<p>Me: east coast gal with the shiniest of diamond hands been holding gme since December </p>
<p>Proposal: a yearly reunion of my fellow apes to celebrate. Backyard bbq- I rock at some amazing steaks and we always serve lots of tendies.  Beer cooler full, yard games galore and fun charity auction because we are generous apes. </p>
<p>When- Yearly celebrating the day the squeeze rockets</p>
<p>Why- because it’s important to me and hopefully others. I’m 37 and last year my mom died and many other family members.
I value family and it doesn’t have to be blood. This journey, as cheesy as this sounds has been and will be full of importance.</p>
<p>We will be  rich why is it a backyard bbq? Because that’s who we are and how we got there. </p>
<p>Proposal submitted to you all  Friday March 26th</p>
<p>Signed</p>
<p>Your friendly BBQing ape,</p>
<p>J</p>
<p>Addendum: photographic evidence of cooking ability, scratch made jalapeño poppers and soup. Please see photos as submission of evidence </p>

<p>Addendum: submitting an add on field trip to visit locales near me. We can rent yellow buses; day after bbq. 
Locale: Rent school buses and I live an hour from Washington DC. The large national zoo, with a special visit to the gorillas</p>
<p>*Note - see comment section for summary</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my submission</p>
<p>Edit: <em>happy cry</em> I am shocked and overwhelmed at the positive response and it feels every ape feels the same- this understanding of the importance of the big picture. I didn’t expect anyone to notice this post. I am truly honored by this. Cheers you beautiful apes!</p>
<p>Saturday edit: the thread is overwhelming to read because it’s apparent the spirit of apes. I love you guys. </p>
<p>Next step? I am holding. When/if that rocket day happens- mark it! It’s our day. The reunion will be amazing, and continue on. I’ll continue to help shape this event- it’ll grow and morph. Keep an eye out for future posts from me to keep it moving in the right direction- this journey just keeps getting better.
I’ll stop being cheesy! Damn apes!
Love you.</p>
