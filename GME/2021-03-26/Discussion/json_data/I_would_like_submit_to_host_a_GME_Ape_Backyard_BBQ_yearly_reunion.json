    "selftext": "Me: east coast gal with the shiniest of diamond hands been holding gme since December \n\nProposal: a yearly reunion of my fellow apes to celebrate. Backyard bbq- I rock at some amazing steaks and we always serve lots of tendies.  Beer cooler full, yard games galore and fun charity auction because we are generous apes. \n\nWhen- Yearly celebrating the day the squeeze rockets\n\nWhy- because it\u2019s important to me and hopefully others. I\u2019m 37 and last year my mom died and many other family members.\nI value family and it doesn\u2019t have to be blood. This journey, as cheesy as this sounds has been and will be full of importance.\n\nWe will be  rich why is it a backyard bbq? Because that\u2019s who we are and how we got there. \n\nProposal submitted to you all  Friday March 26th\n\nSigned\n\nYour friendly BBQing ape,\n\nJ\n\nAddendum: photographic evidence of cooking ability, scratch made jalape\u00f1o poppers and soup. Please see photos as submission of evidence \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/V02S3gh\n\nAddendum: submitting an add on field trip to visit locales near me. We can rent yellow buses; day after bbq. \nLocale: Rent school buses and I live an hour from Washington DC. The large national zoo, with a special visit to the gorillas\n\n*Note - see comment section for summary\n\nThank you for considering my submission\n\n\nEdit: *happy cry* I am shocked and overwhelmed at the positive response and it feels every ape feels the same- this understanding of the importance of the big picture. I didn\u2019t expect anyone to notice this post. I am truly honored by this. Cheers you beautiful apes!\n\nSaturday edit: the thread is overwhelming to read because it\u2019s apparent the spirit of apes. I love you guys. \n\nNext step? I am holding. When/if that rocket day happens- mark it! It\u2019s our day. The reunion will be amazing, and continue on. I\u2019ll continue to help shape this event- it\u2019ll grow and morph. Keep an eye out for future posts from me to keep it moving in the right direction- this journey just keeps getting better.\nI\u2019ll stop being cheesy! Damn apes!\nLove you.",
