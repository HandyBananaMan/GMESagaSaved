Me: east coast gal with the shiniest of diamond hands been holding gme since December 

Proposal: a yearly reunion of my fellow apes to celebrate. Backyard bbq- I rock at some amazing steaks and we always serve lots of tendies.  Beer cooler full, yard games galore and fun charity auction because we are generous apes. 

When- Yearly celebrating the day the squeeze rockets

Why- because it’s important to me and hopefully others. I’m 37 and last year my mom died and many other family members.
I value family and it doesn’t have to be blood. This journey, as cheesy as this sounds has been and will be full of importance.

We will be  rich why is it a backyard bbq? Because that’s who we are and how we got there. 

Proposal submitted to you all  Friday March 26th

Signed

Your friendly BBQing ape,

J

Addendum: photographic evidence of cooking ability, scratch made jalapeño poppers and soup. Please see photos as submission of evidence

Addendum: submitting an add on field trip to visit locales near me. We can rent yellow buses; day after bbq. 
Locale: Rent school buses and I live an hour from Washington DC. The large national zoo, with a special visit to the gorillas

*Note - see comment section for summary

Thank you for considering my submission


Edit: *happy cry* I am shocked and overwhelmed at the positive response and it feels every ape feels the same- this understanding of the importance of the big picture. I didn’t expect anyone to notice this post. I am truly honored by this. Cheers you beautiful apes!

Saturday edit: the thread is overwhelming to read because it’s apparent the spirit of apes. I love you guys. 

Next step? I am holding. When/if that rocket day happens- mark it! It’s our day. The reunion will be amazing, and continue on. I’ll continue to help shape this event- it’ll grow and morph. Keep an eye out for future posts from me to keep it moving in the right direction- this journey just keeps getting better.
I’ll stop being cheesy! Damn apes!
Love you.
