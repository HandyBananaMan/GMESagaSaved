And donate their time, change the lives of themselves and their loved ones, make a change in the world for the better

So on and so fourth?

Oh and ðŸš€

**Edit**: I am upvoting each and every reply as I can, I want you to reach your dreams. Our dreams!

**Edit 2**: At the rate comments are arriving, I can't upvote everyone anymore! I may miss someone! But still thank you for sharing!

And yes this is my first submission , no I am not a shill karma farming. I have been a lurker in financial subreddits long before I got into gme.

**Edit 3** : Shout out to /r/antiwork

**Edit 4** : Holy crap. I left for a bit and came back to 20k upvotes and 3k+ comments . I shouldn't be surprised we all feel the same way, but wow! **hlod!**

**Edit 5** never had a front page post before. If you're new to this whole ordeal, read the stickied threads at the top of this subreddit to get up to speed. If you're interested in buying shares find a broker (not Robinhood) to use to buy shares on the stock market. Not financial advise ! read the stickies!
