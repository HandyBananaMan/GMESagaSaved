<p>And yes this is my first submission , no I am not a shill karma farming. I have been a lurker in financial subreddits long before I got into gme.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong> : Shout out to /r/antiwork</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4</strong> : Holy crap. I left for a bit and came back to 20k upvotes and 3k+ comments . I shouldn't be surprised we all feel the same way, but wow! <strong>hlod!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 5</strong> never had a front page post before. If you're new to this whole ordeal, read the stickied threads at the top of this subreddit to get up to speed.
