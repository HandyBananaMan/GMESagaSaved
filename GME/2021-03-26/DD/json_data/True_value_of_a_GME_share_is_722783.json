    "selftext": "EDIT: Holy shit did you guys blow this up. Thank you for all the awards as well jesus christ! I had to restart my phone this morning because I was overloaded with notifications and messages, I am trying to reply to all but it is kinda crazy. As much as I appreciate all the awards save your bananas for tickets to the moon! Also as I didn't expect this to blow up I was just kinda rough with my working out as I typed this up on my phone before going to bed so I will now add more detail to avoid the same questions being asked.\n\nThis is not financial advice I'm an ape who puts numbers into robot and it go beep boop bbrrrr. \n\nOk so I'm assuming we have now all seen the \"glitch\" orders. I don't believe they are glitches. Once you can say ok it happened but we have seen it happen 5 times and the first time it happened, 94m on $46.12 the price was then at $184.68 less than 24 hours later.\n\nUsing the share orders that have appeared over the last four days. (630m, 113m, 290m, 167m) that totals 1.2B - The reason why I have added them all together rather than using them individually is that 630m was the first order that appeared. I know these hedgefunds aren't covering so the next day when 113m appeared there is no way they covered 517m shares. I think the 1.2B (and counting) are linked to the darkpool and the shit show that is the ETF packages. \n\nIf you need a video break this is along the lines of what I'm thinking. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25EUhZGBws\n\nUsing the last buy order that appeared in February of 94m that jumped the price from $46.12 to $184.68 an increase of 300.434% \n\nTo work out what the true value of a GME share price is right now we take the 1,201,846,831 share order and divide it by 94,189,110 the first order back in Feb. \n\n1,201,846,831 / 94,189,110  = 12.75993404 \n\nKnowing that a 94m order increased the price by just over 300% we can now hypothetically see what a 1.2B share order will do to the price. \n\n300.434 x 12.75993404 = 3833.518\n\nA 3833.518% increase on $183.75 \n\n$7,227.83\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBut wait... I thought $10m was the floor? \n\nOh Apes... beautiful beautiful apes. I said the true value of a GME share right now is $7,227.83 based on very simple maths and everything being linear from the last crazy buy order. \n\nThe GME float is 42.28m. Yahoo reports that institutions hold 167.96% of the float its likely much higher. Retail is also likely much higher. \n\nIf we put this in terms of SI% a buy order for 1.2B shares is 2654% of the float. YES. 2654!!!!!\n\n42.28m x 26.54255369 = 1,201,846,831 \n\nThey have to buy the float 26.54 times before they can close their position and say all those shares were sold and available immediately and at the same time then the price right now would be $7,227.83. I believe that these numbers will only increase as time goes on. The longer this drags out the more shares they will print and the more they will have to pay diamond handed apes. Don't be frustrated by waiting if these Hedgies want to pay for a round trip to a galaxy far far away let them. I only wanted to go to the moon but they insist apes take out the death star. \n\nSo guess what happens when apes diamond hand?\n\n\ud83e\udd8d + \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c = \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a\ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf4c\n\n\nIf there is no supply and there is demand of 1.2B and counting as these hedgefunds are still carrying on with this illegal shit the squeeze will last weeks the price will get higher and higher. I'm not putting a exact price or date on anything but $10m is not a meme and hedgefunds will eventually be liquidated. They have insurance policies, a ton of assets, the DTCC and the goverment will all make sure apes get paid. \n\nDon't fuck with apes. Apes set high scores. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
