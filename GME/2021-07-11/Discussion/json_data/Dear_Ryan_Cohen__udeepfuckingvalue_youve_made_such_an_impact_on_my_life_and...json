    "selftext": "Dear Ryan Cohen & u/deepfuckingvalue,\n\nI\u2019m a simple man, I live a simple life. I\u2019ve never been rich, and I\u2019ve never been poor. I work hard, I provide for my family, I help out my friends when I can, I go to church, I help the old lady in the parking lot to her car, and sometimes I get lucky and find a nickel on the ground. \n\nYou\u2019ve changed my life and so many others. You give the guys like me hope, something to look forward to. You give me, just a little minnow, who swims around a world full of sharks, confidence that although we are just a little minnow, thousands of us can take on a shark and live to tell the story. \n\nMy child is due in November. I\u2019ve decided that if we MOASS before then, I\u2019ll name my child \u2018Cohen Keith\u2019 in honor of both of you. He\u2019ll always have a story behind his name, and always be proud to be a minnow. \n\nMaybe one day he\u2019ll even be able to shake your hand and say \u201cthank you sir,\u201d cause the 1% who live to tell this story will always remember where they came from, and just what it took to be able to swim with the sharks. \n\nSigned,\n\n~Tim",
