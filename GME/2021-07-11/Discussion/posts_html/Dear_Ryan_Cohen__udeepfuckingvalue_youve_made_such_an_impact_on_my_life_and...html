<p>Dear Ryan Cohen &amp; u/deepfuckingvalue,</p>
<p>I’m a simple man, I live a simple life. I’ve never been rich, and I’ve never been poor. I work hard, I provide for my family, I help out my friends when I can, I go to church, I help the old lady in the parking lot to her car, and sometimes I get lucky and find a nickel on the ground. </p>
<p>You’ve changed my life and so many others. You give the guys like me hope, something to look forward to. You give me, just a little minnow, who swims around a world full of sharks, confidence that although we are just a little minnow, thousands of us can take on a shark and live to tell the story. </p>
<p>My child is due in November. I’ve decided that if we MOASS before then, I’ll name my child ‘Cohen Keith’ in honor of both of you. He’ll always have a story behind his name, and always be proud to be a minnow. </p>
<p>Maybe one day he’ll even be able to shake your hand and say “thank you sir,” cause the 1% who live to tell this story will always remember where they came from, and just what it took to be able to swim with the sharks. </p>
<p>Signed,</p>
