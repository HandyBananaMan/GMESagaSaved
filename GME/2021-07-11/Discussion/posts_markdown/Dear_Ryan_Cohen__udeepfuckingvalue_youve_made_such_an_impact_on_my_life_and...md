Dear Ryan Cohen & u/deepfuckingvalue,

I’m a simple man, I live a simple life. I’ve never been rich, and I’ve never been poor. I work hard, I provide for my family, I help out my friends when I can, I go to church, I help the old lady in the parking lot to her car, and sometimes I get lucky and find a nickel on the ground. 

You’ve changed my life and so many others. You give the guys like me hope, something to look forward to. You give me, just a little minnow, who swims around a world full of sharks, confidence that although we are just a little minnow, thousands of us can take on a shark and live to tell the story. 

My child is due in November. I’ve decided that if we MOASS before then, I’ll name my child ‘Cohen Keith’ in honor of both of you. He’ll always have a story behind his name, and always be proud to be a minnow. 

Maybe one day he’ll even be able to shake your hand and say “thank you sir,” cause the 1% who live to tell this story will always remember where they came from, and just what it took to be able to swim with the sharks. 

Signed,

~Tim
