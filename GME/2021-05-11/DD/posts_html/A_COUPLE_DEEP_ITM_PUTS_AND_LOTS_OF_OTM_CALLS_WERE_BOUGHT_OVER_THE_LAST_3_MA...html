<p>Good evening Apes,</p>
<p>Sorry for the lack of posts lately but sometimes life gets in the way. Fortunately I still managed to find time to save the data from each market day. With that said let's get into it.</p>

<p>Friday is where we basically saw all of the action. There were block purchases of 684 $300 puts for $9,435,780 with expirations 5/7(same day) and 6/18 out of EMLD (Miami). The other super interesting action can be found within the $800 calls purchased in mass quantities (\~5063 calls) expiring July 16. These trades total somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5 million and came out of BZX (Chicago) and GEMX (regional exchange for Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia). Quick crayon break and we'll move on.</p>

<p>Nothing really of note on Monday a relatively quiet day on the options front.</p>

<p>Today (tuesday) was another seemingly calm day in terms of options although we saw a bit more activity with the $800 OTM calls with roughly 346 purchased in large block trades out of BZX and PEARL with the same July 16 expiration date. Let's keep in mind these $800 DEEP OTM calls are very cheap but they still have a cost. Not sure if these are being used as a bullish bet, as a hedge, or if somehow this all ties back to the FTD resets.  Not my job to sit here and speculate, I am just a smooth-brained crayon eating ape that's here to bring you the data.  Hopefully will be seeing you again tomorrow. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Dan_Bren/">u/Dan_Bren</a> out.</p>
