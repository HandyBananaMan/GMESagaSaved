<p>Something I haven't seen mentioned yet that I think could help the MOASS reach its full potential is to sell on the most unique numbers possible. The human brain is attracted to simplified, rounded numbers and, unfortunately, apes are very closely related to humans. If you are planning on selling a share at $15,000,000 how many other apes will likely do the same? This could cause a stall or dip that may potentially be avoided if apes were to pick more unique numbers like $15,000,137.86 </p>
<p>It's a small and easy thing to do. For all I know it might not make much difference, but it certainly couldn't hurt! And if it could mean a greater MOASS than it's something I will personally be incorporating into my exit strategy. If you agree with this concept please share the idea wherever you can as many apes will likely never see this post. </p>

<p>PS: I'm not a financial advisor and I don't know if anybody in this sub is.</p>
<p>EDIT: in case you are interpreting this as selling on the way up, don't do that lol. The whole thing will be volatile and any reduction of downward pressure is good.</p>
