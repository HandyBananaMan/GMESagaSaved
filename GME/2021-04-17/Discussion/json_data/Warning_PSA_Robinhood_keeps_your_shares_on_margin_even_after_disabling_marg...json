I just transferred all my shares to Fidelity and noticed the \"M\" icon next to all shares. *Please note that I had margin disabled in Robinhood before I purchased my shares.*  \n\n**After calling Fidelity, the rep confirmed that my shares are ALL ON MARGIN.** \n\n*He said that they've noticed it too, and it's very odd, but ALL shares transferred from Robinhood to Fidelity have been on margin whether or not the user had margin turned on or off.*  \n\nGet out of Robinhood NOW! If you value your money or future and would like to sell your shares when the MOASS happens, get away from that shady broker and their illegal margin switching practices. \n\n  My transfer from Robinhood to Fidelity only took 2 days (with no pending sales or cash settling).",
