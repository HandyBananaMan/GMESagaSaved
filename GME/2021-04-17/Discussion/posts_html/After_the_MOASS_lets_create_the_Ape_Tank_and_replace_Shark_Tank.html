<p>It would essentially be shark tank, but instead of dumb ass products we would only invest in projects that are beneficial to the world such as renewable clean energy, recycling, water accessibility and purification, housing in underdeveloped countries, the list is endless. It would be really cool to have a bunch of us apes come together and put our tendies to good use. Imagine all the good we could do with our collective bananas! APES TOGETHER STRONG! </p>
