**Just the usual conflict of Interests - are you even suprised at this point? Because if Motley Fool can be a Hedge Fund, why can´t MarketWatch also be part of an Exchange and feed news to CNBC. Nothing to see here.**

Quote:  "The award recognizes Griffin for his significant contributions to the financial industry. The CME Group Melamed-Arditti Innovation Award strives to **celebrate innovation (that rip off retailers - sry that´s my part)** that, through practical application, has had a **positive impact on the economic well-being of individuals, industries or nations.**"

So from the 16.11.2020 Citadel Advisors LLC upped their position from previously 119,449 shares to 124,353 shares of the CME group on the 31.12.2020,

**Totally normal to get praised by the people you have a stake in.**

"**Griffin used an ownership company to acquire the house from dePeyster.  She was the second wife of Rupert Murdoch**, CEO and founder of **News Corp**.  and creator of FOX Broadcasting. "

I wonder if this is important, but I guess every rich person has shaken the hand of one another at one point.

And with this I conclude my Post and hand my Baton over to the next Ape, who may find more.
