I can't afford buying GME stock simply as the money I currently own lost pretty much all of its value. The salary of someone in my field went from being valued at 1200$ per month to 130$ and I can't risk the limited amount of dollars I have.

Please hold brothers, let the wealth go back to those who deserve it.            \nEdit: Thank you for the awards!!
