So banks in Lebanon ran a ponzi scheme and fucked our economy to kingdom come ([Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=lebanese+ponzy+scheme&oq=lebanese+ponzy+scheme&aqs=chrome..69i57.7158j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). I can't afford buying GME stock simply as the money I currently own lost pretty much all of its value. The salary of someone in my field went from being valued at 1200$ per month to 130$ and I can't risk the limited amount of dollars I have. But seeing this sub gave me so much satisfaction and hope that there might be some justice out there. We'll probably never get justice in Lebanon but seeing you guys, teach all those hedge funds a lesson in humility and fear fills me with so much joy. Please hold brothers, let the wealth go back to those who deserve it.            
Edit: Thank you for the awards!! But please do consider donating the money to your local charity/family or a ![Lebanese](https://www.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/iaaksr/list_of_lebanese_ngos_that_are_verified_and_safe/) NGO.
