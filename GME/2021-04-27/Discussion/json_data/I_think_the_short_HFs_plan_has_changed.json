    "selftext": "I think Short HF\u2019s objectives have changed\n\nSpeculative post therefore flaired as a discussion.\n\nImagine for a minute that you are Kenny G. An egotistical, calculating, selfish man.\n\nYou start shorting GameStop because you know you and your buddies can run it into the ground, a solid plan, has worked time and time again.\n\nNow \ud83d\udc8e \u270b \ud83e\udd8d step up to the plate.\nNo worries, keep shorting. After all, there is no limit to the shit you can pull and get away with it under the SECs lazy gaze. \n\nYou keep shorting and they keep buying. It\u2019s getting a bit tougher now but you can still naked short sell an infinite amount of shares and you\u2019ll be fine. Hell, you can practically feel the billions of dollars you\u2019ll make because of the system that you rigged. Can\u2019t go tits up.\n\nThen the DTCC starts making rules to protect its other members. Rules that stop you from making money. Rules that threaten to liquidate you. And these rules are coming faster and faster. \n\nSuddenly, you don\u2019t have much time left...\nYour goal changes.\n\nYou don\u2019t care about bankrupting GME anymore. You care about bankrupting the very entity that wants to liquidate you.\n\nYou\u2019re going down at the hands of the DTCC, and you\u2019ll be damned if it doesn\u2019t go down with you.\n \nSo now you pull every trick in the book. You short every share, every ETF, every fucking thing you can get your clammy hands on. You want to fuck your holdings so badly that every member of the DTCC clenches their assholes at the mere thought of having to cover even a FRACTION of your position. \n\nYou, Ken Griffin, KNOW that GME will moon to tens of millions of dollars per share. And you want your liquidator to be holding the bag when it does.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nI think the game has changed. Shorts know they are fucked and want to take the DTCC down with them.\n\nEdit: my first ever awards!! Thank you guys so much it really means a lot! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
