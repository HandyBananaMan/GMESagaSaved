This is not a discussion about the MOASS, or probabilities, or option chains. There are no positions here, only a curse. Shorty's interns can take it as they will.
No emojis, very long.

#Part 1: Observations about technical indicators

I am a firm believer in *certain types* of technical analysis, Japanese candlestick analysis being a primary one. Because, at it's *fundamental* (and you'll see me use that word a lot through this post) every price tick is a signifier of a settled negotiation between a buyer and a seller. Each party aims to optimize their profit (or reduce cost), and when this occurs, a price is reached - like cellular automata, the price affects nearby prices, future prices, derivative prices and so on. This price negotiation can be seen played out in candlestick patterns because all patterns come back down to how much a seller is willing to negotiate and how far a buyer can be budged. When the negotiation goes in the seller's favor (e.g. ascending triangle, when the seller keeps pushing higher, with higher volume, but the buyer doesn't move) you get bullish patterns, and a "breakout" signaling the sellers' decisive victory.

The patterns are not predictive - they are a *signal* of the state of the negotiation.

**1. On every single day that GME has been on the SSR list, EVERY SINGLE CANDLESTICK PATTERN resolves as per theory.** On the 1 minute candles, on the 5, 10, 30 minute candles.

Yes, even the bearish runs, cups and handles, abandoned babies, the whole lot, even when shorts borrow shares and try to lower the price, when whales buy crazy amounts of shares. There is nothing mysterious about it - outlier events like large amount of shorting, whales, sudden surge in volatility - these are *all* part of market dynamics. **The stock is overall very bullish. People like the stock**

**2. On every single day that GME has been on the SSR list, the Bollinger Bands are a proper predictor of volatility and Bollinger squeezes, down to the 1-minute candlesticks.**

GME behaves like a real, organic stock on days when it is on the SSR list (Pinocchio is a real boy, mommy!) no matter how hyped up it is, no matter now many bots and shills are around, no matter what tweet shows up. A **very** high volatility stock, dragging the Bollinger Bands upwards, but it is *not* an irrational stock in terms of market mechanics.

##What does this tell us? It tells us WE (as in WSB and other retail retards) are NOT the ones breaking the market, WE are not the ones that are acting irrationally.

##The repeated doubling down of the shorts on days when iborrowdesk shows 0 shares left, when borrow interest exceeds 3%, when GME is NOT on the SSR list - THOSE ARE THE IRRATIONAL DAYS. No candlestick pattern resolves as it should, Bollinger Bands are *not* overall good predictors of volatility.

##Shorty is the one disrupting the rationality of the market. Shorty is the one that acted against the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

#2: The Desecration of the Temple, or Why the market will destroy Shorty in the end
 
I am a capitalist by religion. And this is because I believe money is the Great Equalizer, money is the *one* instrument we as a species have that has the power to uphold the essential dignity of all men. 

Whether you are a prince or a pauper, a sinner or a saint, you walk into a bakery with a dollar, you should get the same loaf of bread as anyone else. In practice, this doesn't work - homeless paupers are kicked out of bakeries, and bakers refuse to serve those they consider sinners. This is because of human irrationality. 

Enter the stock market - buy and sell orders have no personal status or convictions. Again, it doesn't quite work: those with a lot of money have perks in order execution, trading times, rules. But it's a step in the right direction, and apps like RH made it so that the homeless (or those living out of cars, dorms, trailers and cheap flats) *could* participate. Yes, they paid a steep price in terms of execution and the sale of their order data, but again, it was a step.

*On January 28th, when RH restricted trading, they transgressed against the fundamentals of capitalist equality. Our dollar was not good enough - billionaires could buy shares, even if they wanted to buy a single one. We couldn't. RH has paid the price for it in terms of PR and client outflow. But they haven't paid in full - that's going to happen when they IPO. That's why they're rushing it, you know - do it *now* because they're bleeding customers every day. "Angel" and other investors want to milk what's left of RH, convert their investment into an actual return, and bail.*

The other part of the religion is *continual increase in buying power*. The bid/ask negotiation is not just about finding an equilibrium, it is about finding an equilibrium that *maximizes the profit of the seller and, by minimizing cost, maximizes the future profit of the buyer*. This is baked into the entire market - *this* is the fundamental reason why, over a long enough timeframe, "stonks only go up". The equation maximizes the profit for all parties, even if it is done one cent at a time. 

Shorting, in its natural state, is about capitalizing on analysis or information that suggests a stock will continually underperform. Due to fundamentals. Shorting GME because it was a brick-and-mortar that was sluggish to change - that makes sense. Shorting GME during the pandemic because all stores were taking a hit - that makes sense. **At its core, shorting is about REACTING to changes in fundamentals**. 

But when you try to change fundamentals by shorting? When you use shorting as an INSTRUMENT (i.e. a bludgeon, not a financial instrument) to get a stock driven so low that it's delisted? 

*Shorting to drive a price down irrespective of fundamentals breaks the basis of the negotiation between buyer and seller in setting a price*.  It's called price manipulation, and it's illegal for the same reason that theft is illegal--because it breaks the social compact. It is contrary to the market's underlying mechanics. And you see it in the price action. 

##GME's tick-by-tick price action on days it is NOT on the SSR list is the biggest signal that short sellers are engaging in illegal price manipulation.

The market can tolerate quite a bit of illegality - a thief makes money when he steals, but, statistically, he can only do it so many times before he gets caught. 

Short sellers are approaching this inevitable, statistical threshold of failure. Even IF all the shorts from pre-Jan-28 covered, now new ones are doubling down. They're doing it again and again and again. At this point, Shorty is *acting irrationally*. Shorty hates the stock, I guess, I have no idea why they are not just cutting losses - again, hearkening back to my earlier post, I think they're hoping to engineer a "miracle" to destroy GME's fundamental thesis in RC. 

On a side note, I fully believe Gabe Plotkin exited his positions - he's a smart one, smarter than most of the other hedgies out there. So he bled, realized it was unsustainable and he sold his soul to get out of pit. But he did get out. The others are just digging their own tunnels into the pit each time they short. **The Stock *wants* to go up!** 

Have you noticed that GME's beta is only negative from days it is *not* on the SSR and Shorty keeps borrowing shares to drive the price down?
