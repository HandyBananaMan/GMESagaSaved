Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and viewed as likely to take aggressive steps to regulate big business.\n    \n    Background:\n    -Chopra \n    worked as a consultant at McKinsey before helping Warren set up the CFPB in 2011. \n    He went on to serve as the agency's assistant director \n    \"student loan pointman,\" before his nomination to the FTC in 2018.\n    \n    -Gensler \n    was a partner at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for 18 years before joining the Treasury Department in 1997. \n    He was nominated by President Obama in 2008 to serve as chairman of the \n    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where he earned as a reputation \n    as an aggressive regulator and Wall Street foe.\n    \n    The big picture: \n    Biden is going to attempt to chart an economic policy that's visibly to \n    the left of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \n    If he succeeds, it's going to show up not only in taxes and spending, \n    but also in regulation.\n\nOk so my take away from this is very simple, we have all been wondering why the hell the SEC is has not been doing anything, I think that if the above is indeed correct it may be the reason that we have not seen them do anything yet.\n\nThe transition may be one of the reasons this has taken more time.\n\nthe guys there don't have full autonomy to go after whatever they want, they have to run everything up the chain to the guys up top to say it's ok and then it can be done but if the guy at the top no longer gives a fuck because he has known (apparently this has been known since January) that he wont be there for another month, or because it's he's not doing enough that got them replaced in the first place.\n\nNow Caveat time; I have noticed people speak of politics of which side they align with and saying this is bad just because it's being done by someone who is not in your political alignment.\n\nLet me introduce you to the European football way of thinking:\n\nLook at it like a game of football, you're team is currently not playing and you're looking at 2 neutral teams playing. now if someone makes a good pass you'd still cheer them on right? awesome touchdown/goal? fucking a!This is how we should view everything from now on, not what team they are from but we should look at how good they play, and what they do.As we have hundreds of Football/soccer teams in Europe per country, but with the WK or EK national teams are formed and players root for their country, not the individual teams.So lets take the politics out of it and focus on the good and the bad players.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixoh47qg5ek61.jpg?width=479&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=715f9f622eb562f788e177ef56a8de88ce257a3d\n\n# March 19th and $130k?\n\nSo we have seen enough about march 19th being a likely date when the Tendieship will be launching near then.\n\nBUT these aren't facts, these are opinions based on data saying it will most likely be around that day, this means that it may not be right then and there, but it's more likely to be around mid to end march.\n\nAlso I've been inundated with DM's of what the date and ceiling of price will be.\n\nLet me be clear, WE DONT KNOW!\n\nThis is some serious Nostradamus level questions but it's all conjecture, we don't know when the moment is here until it's actually here and the peak is here.\n\nBut the fact that a lot of people themselves have found prices from 100k to 140k per share is telling me that these may be numbers we need to keep in mind.\n\nWe can guess by using math's, or by looking at all the things on the calendar (with puts calls etc), and that will give us some sort of an idea but Wen Moon but it won't give us an exact date or price.If we could do this.So lets go over some simple stuff that may give us some idea why I personally think it will be around that date:\n\nLets get the speculative things out of the way, Cohen's tweet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7icci5ds6ek61.jpg?width=595&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03fc1d84e93e69d3e82e190124fc1a31fa0619a9\n\nMarch 20th; World frog dayMarch 20th; 25-cent ice cream cones at McDonald's during International Day of Happiness\n\nthe ice-cream cone can also be a reference to Ray Kroc how he took over as CEO in a very tricky way. (go watch the movie the founder). Mr. Kroc had a vision for McDonalds to become bigger than the current owners ever imagined, much like Cohen has a great vision for what GME can become.Less brick and mortar but a healthy mix between normal stores and a Amazon for games.\n\nI've seen posts here on that people ordered stuff from GameStop online and have it delivered in an hour or 2, because GME is using the local stores as a delivery hub and having Doordash deliver them to local customers. this is only one thing of course but its just a very imaginative way to fix a fast delivery system.\n\nIt can also be a reference to this part of the big short:\n\n[https://youtu.be/YoEbj5KkWG0?t=88](https://youtu.be/YoEbj5KkWG0?t=88)\n\nYou get the sundae Vinnie (the soft serves are called Sundae's in Europe)\n\nAlso if what I've read so far is correct most CEO's will step down or new ones step in with the release of the quarterly profit reports. And GME's earnings report is expected before the 25th of march.\n\nso this leads me to personally believe that it can be happening around the 19th and the 25th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DFV's positions](https://preview.redd.it/8if9hvky8ek61.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df3cce34d83cb96357f13e5f3296a1b75ca73cc)\n\nJust felt like this warranted another post, He's still in I'm still in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gybjjc4aek61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=796f1727621e27bacfc22f5775f110d57c35fb57\n\nRemember, we have seen bots, shills trolls and everything in between in the past month, don't for a second think we are in the clear at all.\n\nWe will see them double down, we will see red days, we will see people spread FUD and fake or bad DD.So do myself a favor and yourself, don't take anything at face value, always double check everything.2 people can look at the same data and come to different conclusions, so always check their work!\n\neven everything I post, double check it, and make your own opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/op7f0kouaek61.jpg?width=320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5ba0cec4546b9c7edbbe2f368f13ba74209f35d\n\n# we are not #occupywallstreet\n\nin the weekend I've heard talks about us being militant, and someone being a \"general\".Let me be very clear about this, we are not and will not be militant.I dislike any form of physical violence to be used as a threat to just get our tendies.\n\nI hate what hedgefunds have done over the years, I hate Melvin and Griffin for the absolute cunts those guys are.But I will always believe that I'd rather make them pay the way we are doing right now, outplaying them at their own game, the game they have owned since forever!And never physically threaten them or any other people with physical violence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14i10syrbek61.jpg?width=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bdc930f936f9f04a68c1ccd7533f18172f2343f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wj42fvtbek61.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74246d7759c881f1bfefc0516175de1143b19bd6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, these people want us to be viewed as \"bad\" or \"evil\" with our \"dumb money\".\n\nDo not give them the chance to do so, show them we are better then that.\n\nBecause we are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo sit back, relax and just see where this go's.\n\nAnd don't ask \"When moon\", because here is his big brother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Soon Moon](https://preview.redd.it/jficq7trcek61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dfef0ba31c5dbe17389ae6fbbb35aeb9b1f084)\n\nAnd Soon Moon is ready for all the fuckery people will throw at him. Because just like us, he can endure.\n\nAnd my favorite quote of him is this:\n\n# \u201cYou must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Become like water my friend.\u201d\n\nand you'll think why the fuck is Moon so in love with water?It's easy the Water can be calm as a small creek but in the ocean it can break rocks on the shoreline.Find your center in this chaos, and learn to thrive.\n\nIf you have been in GME since January you've learned the most important thing already, Patience!Don't panic, Don't sell when it becomes a little red, because you know it can be green.\n\nThese experiences normally take months/years before people learn these.And here we smooth brained retarded monkeys have learned this valuable lesson in only a few weeks.So try to look at things from a different perspectives, you may have been blessed with experience without even knowing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xaf8tbygeek61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0338a787f73b21197486bd796d1e894262798fe\n\nDid you know San Diago was first discovered by Germans in 1904? San Diago, which of course means \"whale's vagina\" in German.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow none of this is financial advice, I'm more likely to snort my crayons than use it to draw.\n\nand I fucking love drawing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55v6oiggcek61.jpg?width=430&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92f092b08e3c37d8b0138f1969e3d2233822a15a\n\nif I missed anything or something needs to be added feel free to let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1:\n\n# Official Hearing date\n\n**March 17 at 12:00 PM ET:** The full Committee will convene for a virtual hearing entitled, \u201cGame Stopped?
