**Dataset \\ Info**

FTD Data Date Range:  2/11/2020 - 12/2/2021 *(Or 11/2/2020 - 2/12/2021 for Americans)*

* Added November and December to highlight previous inactivity in the ETFs vs the sudden uptick in ETF  FTDs.
* You'll see that the almost mega squeeze was ETF based.
* You'll see that the latest mini squeezes are GME stock based.
* When they stop using the ETFs to short, they start using GME to short and vice versa.

**P.S:** This amount of data was not easy to compile into 2 easy charts. Had to manually transform several thousand lines of data multiple times by hand manually and enter dates manually for thousands of rows. You apes better use it, speculate and come up with conclusions on what happened and what's going on.

***Nothing's over. Don't relax because of a couple of DFV tweets. The price is still $120, not $100k. All scenarios are still in play, including apes getting rekt.***
