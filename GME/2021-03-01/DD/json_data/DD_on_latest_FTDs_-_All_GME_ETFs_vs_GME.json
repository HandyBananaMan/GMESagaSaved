Had to manually transform several thousand lines of data multiple times by hand manually and enter dates manually for thousands of rows. You apes better use it, speculate and come up with conclusions on what happened and what's going on.\n\n***Nothing's over. Don't relax because of a couple of DFV tweets. The price is still $120, not $100k. All scenarios are still in play, including apes getting rekt.***",
