But according to the latest filing in his tumultuous divorce case, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin may be one of them.\n\nAccording to the latest filings, Griffin\u2019s ex-wife, Anne Dias, said his monthly gross income \u201capproaches $100 million,\u201d and his net monthly income after taxes \u201caverages over $68.5 million.\u201d\n\nThat works out to more than $2.2 million a day, or upward of $90,000 per hour.\n\nA spokeswoman for Griffin declined to comment on the filing.\n\nDias\u2019 filing is sure to escalate their ongoing dispute over child support, in which she is asking for $1 million a month in child support. Griffin argues that amount is excessive and includes expenses such as private jets, $450,000 vacations and $6,800 a month for groceries that are mainly for Dias\u2019 \u201copulent lifestyle.\u201d He has told the court he will only fund expenses he deems \u201creasonable.\u201d  \n\n\nDias says she\u2019s adhering to Illinois law, which requires Griffin to fund the three children\u2019s lifestyle as it was during their parents\u2019 marriage. She says the expenses such as the jets and groceries are simply an accounting of all the couple\u2019s child-related expenses while they were married.\n\nRead More[Why 1 percenters are like one-hit wonders](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/25/why-1-percenters-are-like-one-hit-wonders.html)  \n\n\n\u201cKen\u2019s false incredulity as to the cost of his children\u2019s lifestyle\u2014a lifestyle which he established and continues to enjoy with the children\u2014is pure hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nIn her filing, Dias acknowledges the family\u2019s large spending habits. But she says Griffin funded and created the lifestyle, so he has little reason to object.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a silly exercise to pretend the day-to-day living expenses for the Griffin children even remotely resembles the norm,\u201d she said. But she adds, \u201cTypical American families do not have a father with a net monthly income of just shy of $70 million.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the understatement of the year.",
