There aren’t many people whose earnings can make the $690 million that Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman raked in last year look low. But according to the latest filing in his tumultuous divorce case, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin may be one of them.

According to the latest filings, Griffin’s ex-wife, Anne Dias, said his monthly gross income “approaches $100 million,” and his net monthly income after taxes “averages over $68.5 million.”

That works out to more than $2.2 million a day, or upward of $90,000 per hour.

A spokeswoman for Griffin declined to comment on the filing.

Dias’ filing is sure to escalate their ongoing dispute over child support, in which she is asking for $1 million a month in child support. Griffin argues that amount is excessive and includes expenses such as private jets, $450,000 vacations and $6,800 a month for groceries that are mainly for Dias’ “opulent lifestyle.” He has told the court he will only fund expenses he deems “reasonable.”  


Dias says she’s adhering to Illinois law, which requires Griffin to fund the three children’s lifestyle as it was during their parents’ marriage. She says the expenses such as the jets and groceries are simply an accounting of all the couple’s child-related expenses while they were married.

“Ken’s false incredulity as to the cost of his children’s lifestyle—a lifestyle which he established and continues to enjoy with the children—is pure hypocrisy.”

In her filing, Dias acknowledges the family’s large spending habits. But she says Griffin funded and created the lifestyle, so he has little reason to object.

“It’s a silly exercise to pretend the day-to-day living expenses for the Griffin children even remotely resembles the norm,” she said. But she adds, “Typical American families do not have a father with a net monthly income of just shy of $70 million.”

That’s the understatement of the year.
