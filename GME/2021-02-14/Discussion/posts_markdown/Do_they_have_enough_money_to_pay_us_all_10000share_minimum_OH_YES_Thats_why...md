When Melvin Capital and Citadel go out of business,  then DTCC will cover it , once DTCC gets exhausted with debts then there is about 25-30 Trillion insurance to cover . 

Bottom line is there are plenty of money in the bank to send us blank cheques. 

I'm listening my man Warren Buffett.  He says Get greedy when others are fearful. 

This is not a financial advice, just an ape's opinion.

Edit : I've decided to go with $77,777 this week,  $88,888 next week , and $99,999 for the week after. Because there is growing demand for my assets now.

HEDGE FUND dumb idiots don't even have shares to short now , how the heck would you say short squeeze done? It hasn't even begun.  They obviously never went to school? If they did they wouldn't  have shorted more than the float would they?
