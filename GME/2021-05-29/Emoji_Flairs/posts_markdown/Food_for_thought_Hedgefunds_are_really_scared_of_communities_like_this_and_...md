# Title: Food for thought: Hedgefunds are really scared of communities like this and this whole situation dragging out because it not only bonded apes around the world together, it essentially trained us to be like DFV

In Jan we looked to DFV our main man and still do. Our guy had diamond hands so great he got taken into a congressional hearing.

Now he has gone dark and we are all trained, educated and aware similar to the cat man. We are an army of individual Roaring Kitties ready to not back down and fight this to the very end.

I'm glad this is dragging out as long as it is as we will most definitely not paper hand before the MOASS now that we have a few more wrinkles.

Hedgefunds: this is not a pump and dump group. We are not a group. I like the stock and I wont sell on petty dips!

Diamond hands guys.

Edit: wow this blew up thanks guys!
