Our guy had diamond hands so great he got taken into a congressional hearing.\n\nNow he has gone dark and we are all trained, educated and aware similar to the cat man. We are an army of individual Roaring Kitties ready to not back down and fight this to the very end.\n\nI'm glad this is dragging out as long as it is as we will most definitely not paper hand before the MOASS now that we have a few more wrinkles.\n\nHedgefunds: this is not a pump and dump group. We are not a group. I like the stock and I wont sell on petty dips!\n\nDiamond hands guys.\n\nEdit: wow this blew up thanks guys!",
