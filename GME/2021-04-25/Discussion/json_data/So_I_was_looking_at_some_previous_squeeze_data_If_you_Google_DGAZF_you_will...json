    "selftext": "So I was looking at some previous squeeze data. If you Google $DGAZF you will find a natural gas stock that it was shorted 43% of August last year. It's trading price went from $135 roughly $25,000 per share within 48 hours. If you look at GME who SI is at least 99.6% but is raging as high as 240% and similarity by the short interest you come to at least a price point of $100,000 per share. We expect Hedgefunds to have a good magnitude of accumulated block shares of shorts that will effect the price range on blast off -- possible trigger a$1200 pushing to $200 (we don't know) but we do know that GME BOARD has yet to pull stock split, dividends etc.....plenty of ammo to push -- reignite the rocket....stay on board keep hands feet and heads inside while lift off is in progress \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
