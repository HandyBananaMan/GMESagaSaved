Very deep. \n\nThey have no choice but to stall and dig deeper by short selling even more. \n\nThey are probably going bankrupt. If you haven't figured out why GME is still high after 4 months ... now you know. \n\nGME will likely get slammed a few more time before the record setting squeeze. This is to scare away the paper hands into selling because of disappointment!\n\nThe above is a repost from fellow ape!\nNo need for upvote, just reposting to spread the word.\nJust read and so you know. That is all.",
