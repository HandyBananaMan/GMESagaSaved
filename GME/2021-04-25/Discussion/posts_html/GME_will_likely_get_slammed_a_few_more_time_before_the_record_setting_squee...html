<p>This is a repost from Yahoo Finance Cecile post:</p>
<p>Media won't cover it but the word is slowly getting out about the 200+ million synthetic shares that are in circulation for a company that issued only 74 million shares. </p>
<p>The short hedge funds are in deep. Very deep. </p>
<p>They have no choice but to stall and dig deeper by short selling even more. </p>
<p>They are probably going bankrupt. If you haven't figured out why GME is still high after 4 months ... now you know. </p>
<p>GME will likely get slammed a few more time before the record setting squeeze. This is to scare away the paper hands into selling because of disappointment!</p>
<p>The above is a repost from fellow ape!
