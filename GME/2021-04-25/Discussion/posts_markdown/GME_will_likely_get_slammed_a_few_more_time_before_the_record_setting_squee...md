This is a repost from Yahoo Finance Cecile post:

Media won't cover it but the word is slowly getting out about the 200+ million synthetic shares that are in circulation for a company that issued only 74 million shares. 

The short hedge funds are in deep. Very deep. 

They have no choice but to stall and dig deeper by short selling even more. 

They are probably going bankrupt. If you haven't figured out why GME is still high after 4 months ... now you know. 

GME will likely get slammed a few more time before the record setting squeeze. This is to scare away the paper hands into selling because of disappointment!

The above is a repost from fellow ape!
