I remember how shitty things were for my family growing up. My mom is a 1st and 2nd grade teacher who married a bipolar narcissist. My dad retired early when I was a kid, and he became a belligerent drunk, physically and mentally abusing my mom, brother, and me whenever possible. She stayed with him because she couldn't support two kids by herself. 

As we grew older, my mom finally filed for divorce, called the police on my father, and we ran away from home. We spent months bouncing from friend's house to friend's house just trying to keep a roof over our heads, where we typically slept on a person's floor.

Most vividly, I remember seeing my mom's bank account of $212.72. With that little amount of money she had to her name... she used every last penny to support me and my brother, even if it meant she didn't eat for a day or two. 

I'm graduating college in a few months, and my dream job has always been to pay my mom back for everything she's done. Even with XX shares and a $10 million floor, it's still not enough to pay her back. 

I'm gonna get you that red Camaro you've always wanted.

 Fuck these narcissist hedgies.
