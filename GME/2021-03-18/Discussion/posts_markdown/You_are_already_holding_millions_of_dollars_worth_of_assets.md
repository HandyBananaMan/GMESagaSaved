If you are holding GME, your shares are already worth $1,000,000 (potentially) and we're just waiting for the market to recognize their worth. 

The most conservative of estimates I've seen even are up to $100k so if you don't believe in the $1m price point per share, it would only take 10 shares to be holding at least $1m worth.

All we have to do is HODL and wait for the rest of the world to recognize it.

This is not financial advice thoðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
