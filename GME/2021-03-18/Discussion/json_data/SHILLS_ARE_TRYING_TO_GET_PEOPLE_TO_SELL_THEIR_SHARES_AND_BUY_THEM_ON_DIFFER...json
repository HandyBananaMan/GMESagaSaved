    "selftext": "Okay guys, we finally reached the endgame. It is only a matter of time when we will finally see it squeeze. I think this is probably their last ditch effort. Why should they try to get us to sell when we only have a fraction of all the shares? Or do we? I think that we are way bigger than any of us could have anticipated. Not only statistics are on our side but also their miserable tries at getting us to sell our shares. Stay strong and HODL. They are almost dead and when they finally die it will be a humongous explosion \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\n\nP.S: If I see any of you sell under $1 million I will personally fuck your wife/husband",
