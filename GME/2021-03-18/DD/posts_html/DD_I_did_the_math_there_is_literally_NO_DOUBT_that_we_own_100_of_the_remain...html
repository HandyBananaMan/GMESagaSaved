<p>Okay fellow apes, listen up, here is some fresh DD straight out of the oven to feed your confirmation bias. ðŸš€</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/jlivhj2mttn61.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aa1145e82687682b56b14ab315fbb0734d47e30">actual footage of me feeding my confirmation bias</a></p>
<p>I stumbled across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7r42a/everyone_on_etoro_is_long_on_gme/">this sweet little screenshot from eToro</a> posted by u/kapein which shows that <strong>9.11%</strong> of all eToro users are holding GME. (Update as of 30/03/2021: still standing at 9.02%)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So i thought to myself, why don't we take this percentage and try to get an estimation about how many apes in total are holding GME right now and see where some variables regarding shares per ape get us. Are you exicted? Because <strong>I AM</strong>, LETS GO! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>I spent the last hour(s) or so researching the largest broker firms and gathered their total user numbers. This list is <strong>by far not complete</strong> which means that the % held by retail investors could be <strong>way way (!)</strong> higher than my estimates. Please let me know if you have access to more brokers data and i will update my list.</p>
<p>Some friendly ape posted a statement from neo-broker Wealthsimple, thats states a GME-ownership of <a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/gme-data">up to 14%</a> (!) of their total users. Therefore I made assumptions regarding the share of users that invested in GME for each broker. For neo-brokers like eToro, Robinhood, Revolut and WeBull I went with an average of 10% GME ownership of all users. (<em>EDIT 3: Also included a scenario for only 5% GME-ownership, as some raised concerns that my 10% assumption may be too optimistic.)</em></p>
<p>Of course we have to consider that the average eToro user might have a higher risk tolerance and is more likely to invest in GME compared to average Joe. So for "classic" brokers that are more known for "passive investing" like Vanguard or Schwab I went with a lower share of users that are invested in GameStop. Some brokers from the Nordics report an ownership of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/grebfmc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">around 1.5% - 2.0%</a> of their users.</p>
<p>From the godlike <a href="https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/">Due Diligence</a> that is around since yesterday I took the total remaining float that is accessible to retail investors, which is only <strong>19.3m shares</strong>. <em>(The rest is in hands of "single" shareholders like Ryan Cohan, BlackRock, etc..)</em></p>
<p>Okay, now that we have a vague feeling of how many GME retail investors we are, lets play with some scenarios.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: GME-ownership of 10% for neo-brokers and 1.5% for classic investment platforms:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/eb99z717i8o61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a7195987db9ed41b8407eaa0c1e3cacc56a627">&#37; of remaining float that is held by retail (Scenario 1)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: GME-ownership of 5% for neo-brokers and 1.5% for classic investment platforms:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/i8fahnkgi8o61.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0849de187deb52bafb8604c8566def34cb819714">&#37; of remaining float that is held by retail (Scenario 2)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As you can see above, if the average ape is holding <strong>only</strong> 5 shares, we would own <strong>more than 150%</strong> of the total remaining float. Even in Scenario 2, which is more conservative, it is more than 125% (!). To be honest i believe that the average ape holds not only 5 shares. There is a good chance that this numbers is more like 25+ shares per ape. Some fellow ape made a comment where he calculated an average of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/grebfmc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">40 shares</a> per invested user for his broker. I know, i know, there are a lot of apes that only hold 1 or 2 bananas or even fractional shares, but dont forget that there are real retail whales like u/deepfuckingvalue or u/HeyItsPixel who own thousands, ten-thousands or even hundred-thousands shares! If we estimate 25 shares for the average ape, we would own around 800% (!!!) of the entire remaining float. Thats just fucking insane! There seems to be <strong>a ton</strong> of synthetic and counterfeit shares around.</p>
<p>Even if there are plenty catalysts, that are still open and likely possible, <strong>a share callback from GameStop should send us to Andromeda and beyond.</strong></p>
<p>I am literally shaking writing this down. We are about to make history!</p>
<p>MELVIN AND SHITADEL WILL FUCKING EXPLODE! THERE IS <strong>NO WAY OUT</strong>! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you have access to more detailed data regarding number of users or even GME-ownership for a specific broker, please let me know via dm. There are too many comments here and it's hard to keep track of all of them. And please add your source (link or screenshot) so I can publish this here as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Made some amendments regarding assumptions for GME ownership, divided into neo-brokers and classic brokers. Added multiple brokers from CA, EU and UK. Please let me know if you are missing a broker and have the respective data about GME-ownership and/or total users for that broker.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Many brother (and sister) apes from Australia and New Zealand reached out to me. Special thanks to u/wawa-weewa who provided me with data for the brokers Sharesies &amp; Hatch. According to these both brokers GME ownership is 3.60% and 2.00%. (Source ~~not~~ confirmed, ~~will add once~~ <a href="https://www.interest.co.nz/personal-finance/108826/thousands-nzers-partake-gamestop-movement-sharesies-users-alone-make-20">available here</a>).</p>
<p>EDIT 3: u/eoinythegod pointed out that my assumptions of Revoluts 12m investors might be misleading as Revolut also provides standard bank accounts. Unfortunatly there is no reporting about trading-only accounts for Revolut, so i guesstimated that around 10% of all Revolut users might use the trading option. If you should have more detailed data, please let me know. Also included a second scenario where only 5% of neo-brokers hold GME (which is very low imo, but some users raised concerns that my 10% assumption might be too optimistic).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>THIS OVERVIEW WILL BE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS!!</p>
<p><em>(no financial advise in any way)</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<p>There is no way that retail holds less than 100% of the remaining float, the actuals number might be much (!!!) higher, maybe even in the 1000%+. Buckle up, because this rocket is about to enter fucking lightspeed! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
