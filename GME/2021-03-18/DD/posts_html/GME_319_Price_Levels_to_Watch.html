<p>edit: putting this up top so it's seen. <strong>I'm GETTING DOWNVOTED TO OBLIVION!!!</strong> Guess the shills don't want us buying anymore... for that I throw the last of my bank account in GME tomorrow. </p>
<p>Endgame is upon us and we all know it. I feel like there isn‚Äôt much of a point in me giving my price predictions anymore, because if you‚Äôve been reading the DD, we all know some MASSIVE FUCKING SHIT is about to go down!!!¬†</p>
<p>Salutations apes, u/possibly6 here with your price levels to watch tomorrow, 3/19. Remember this ain‚Äôt no mothafuckin financial advice hoe, I Ape am an.</p>
<p>I received a few messages from people yesterday asking if I was going to post as usual, I‚Äôm sorry but (turns out I have Covid lol) I wasn‚Äôt feelin it. I‚Äôm actually feeling a lot better today, so I guess there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll keep the DD brief. Look at this 1hr view of GME.</p>

<p>Look at the light blue support and resistance lines. The patterns here are known as a symmetrical triangle and a descending channel. Basically, price has bounced around off these levels, as you can visualize above.</p>
<p>Something to note, if you didn't see my last <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6qx4b/the_cup_and_handle_pattern_explained_for_dummies/">DD</a>, the very small green box underneath the purple line is a gap up from March 8th. There is <strong>VERY STRONG SUPPORT</strong>  at the 172 level (red line above the purple line.)</p>
<p>Symmetrical triangles can break in either direction (see below)</p>

<p>I would LOVE to see the breakout to the upside, though I suspect tomorrow will be a last-ditch effort by the shorties to demoralize retailers and try to get people to sell (spoiler alert: it won't work).</p>
<p>idk about you, but I have an addiction to buying GME shares. Everyday the squeeze is not squoze, I buy at least 1 share.</p>
<p>That being said, I LOVE buying my favorite stock for CHEAP, so the levels that I will be watching tomorrow to average up (I first started accumulating at 16 hehe) are <strong>187-190</strong> (light blue line), <strong>172</strong>, <strong>157</strong> (bottom of big green box) and I have a hail Mary buy order for <strong>150</strong>.</p>

<p>This rocket is about to take off, and idk about you, but <strong>IM JACKED TO THE FUCKING TITS</strong></p>

<p>I would love to see us liftoff tomorrow, but I don't like putting dates on things as it just leads to disappointment should it not happen on said date. nonetheless, payday is coming soon. I can feel it. I've never seen this community so excited, even when GME has been having a down week.</p>
<p>TLDR: THE SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT! I suspect tomorrow shorts will play dirty, and I expect a crazy fucking volatile day due to quad witching. Buy and <strong>HODL!!!</strong> Support levels to watch tomorrow are <strong>187, 172, 157,</strong> and if shit gets really crazy, <strong>140.</strong> In all honesty I'll be buying throughout the day cause price literally doesn't matter as of now.</p>
