<p>A popular daily DD ape known as Warden_Elite was banned after being falsely accused of hateful comments today, see his tweet for proof. Make sure you follow relevant apes that you find valuable for info on other social media platforms so that this new tactic by shills wont work.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elite_warden/status/1372683282937225216">Warden Elite on Twitter: "Spread the word. The shills attacked my account and now I'm apparently suspended. This how we know we are winning, when they mass report a random comment to get me suspended! Everybody, HOLD THE LINE. Meanwhile, I'll contact Reddit about this. https://t.co/XCQd6mRUVy" / Twitter</a></p>
<p>Please UPVOTE for visibility</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> He has made another account here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WardenElite2">WardenElite2 (u/WardenElite2) - Reddit</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Can confirm reports that <strong>HeyItsPixel</strong> has also been banned, unknown reason why yet. ~~I am sure Rensole and other admins will get him back in here as well soon enough.~~ For now, his twitter is  <a href="https://twitter.com/HeyItsPixel1">Josh ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤² (@HeyItsPixel1) / Twitter</a> . ~~I will update his new user info here before the market opens. Right now I am off to bed, got 4 hours to get some slep.~~  Screw sleep apparently. Pixel is already back at  <img alt="u/HeyItsNotJosh" src="https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsNotJosh" /> </p>

<p>EDIT: Just want to thank everyone for getting the word out. I appreciate the awards but they really weren't necessary. I was just doing my part to help alert apes to an issue.</p>
