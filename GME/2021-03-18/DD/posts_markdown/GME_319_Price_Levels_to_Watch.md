edit: putting this up top so it's seen. **I'm GETTING DOWNVOTED TO OBLIVION!!!** Guess the shills don't want us buying anymore... for that I throw the last of my bank account in GME tomorrow. 

Endgame is upon us and we all know it. I feel like there isn‚Äôt much of a point in me giving my price predictions anymore, because if you‚Äôve been reading the DD, we all know some MASSIVE FUCKING SHIT is about to go down!!!¬†

Salutations apes, u/possibly6 here with your price levels to watch tomorrow, 3/19. Remember this ain‚Äôt no mothafuckin financial advice hoe, I Ape am an.

I received a few messages from people yesterday asking if I was going to post as usual, I‚Äôm sorry but (turns out I have Covid lol) I wasn‚Äôt feelin it. I‚Äôm actually feeling a lot better today, so I guess there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel.

I‚Äôll keep the DD brief. Look at this 1hr view of GME.

Look at the light blue support and resistance lines. The patterns here are known as a symmetrical triangle and a descending channel. Basically, price has bounced around off these levels, as you can visualize above.

Something to note, if you didn't see my last [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6qx4b/the_cup_and_handle_pattern_explained_for_dummies/), the very small green box underneath the purple line is a gap up from March 8th. There is **VERY STRONG SUPPORT**  at the 172 level (red line above the purple line.)

Symmetrical triangles can break in either direction (see below)

I would LOVE to see the breakout to the upside, though I suspect tomorrow will be a last-ditch effort by the shorties to demoralize retailers and try to get people to sell (spoiler alert: it won't work).

idk about you, but I have an addiction to buying GME shares. Everyday the squeeze is not squoze, I buy at least 1 share.

That being said, I LOVE buying my favorite stock for CHEAP, so the levels that I will be watching tomorrow to average up (I first started accumulating at 16 hehe) are **187-190** (light blue line), **172**, **157** (bottom of big green box) and I have a hail Mary buy order for **150**.

[BLUE = 187-190    RED = 172    BOTTOM OF BIG GREEN BOX: 157     PURPLE\/GREEN=140](https://preview.redd.it/1jsavonyhvn61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=b52aad12338a5b1ecc3295ccf49756309eb1cdef)

This rocket is about to take off, and idk about you, but **IM JACKED TO THE FUCKING TITS**

![MACD and TTM Squeeze look Bullish on the 4hr](https://preview.redd.it/od10e20rivn61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbef8a7209f6b25e2d94da8669710024b4b60ff3)

I would love to see us liftoff tomorrow, but I don't like putting dates on things as it just leads to disappointment should it not happen on said date. nonetheless, payday is coming soon. I can feel it. I've never seen this community so excited, even when GME has been having a down week.

TLDR: THE SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT! I suspect tomorrow shorts will play dirty, and I expect a crazy fucking volatile day due to quad witching. Buy and **HODL!!!** Support levels to watch tomorrow are **187, 172, 157,** and if shit gets really crazy, **140.** In all honesty I'll be buying throughout the day cause price literally doesn't matter as of now.
