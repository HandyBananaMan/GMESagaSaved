# Title: Once the squeeze starts, remember even if brokers disable "buying" it does NOT MATTER! we have already bought out all of the remaining float! Keep holding till 1mil+ and they will have no option but to buy at that price! we are the MM now! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

If we don't sell, they will offer us a blow job on top of the 1mil!

DO NOT PANIC SELL. Buying is irrelevant once the squeeze starts!
