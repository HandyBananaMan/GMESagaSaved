#Title: PSA: The price of GME is fake. It’s being manipulated. Don’t freak out if you see dips (sales) today or tomorrow. Short’s know about March 19th. They will be out in full force. Stay strong. Love you all 🙌💎

The game is rigged. We all know this. 

Shorts know it too. They know about March 19th. 

DO NOT GET HUNG UP ON DATES.

The time will come. The catalyst will come. Stay patient. 

Throw your expectations out the door. 

EXPECT some weird shit to go down. 
EXPECT them to tank the price.

The price does not matter. We know it’s a fake price. They have used fake or “synthetic” shares to drop the price.

Why you might ask? 

Psychological warfare. 

They want to make it look unappealing. Or make it seem like this “run” is over. 

“Maybe if we tank the price and spread a bunch of FUD, they will get bored, sell and move onto something else”.

This ^ is their plan. 

I know this thanks to some of the AMAZING DD done by some great members of this group.

If you need, block out the noise. Turn off your phone. Don’t worry about transferring your account. 

Just sit back and enjoy the ride. 

Love you all. Stay patient
