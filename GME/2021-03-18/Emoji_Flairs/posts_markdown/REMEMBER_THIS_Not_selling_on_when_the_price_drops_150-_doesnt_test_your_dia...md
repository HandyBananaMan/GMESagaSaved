#Title: REMEMBER THIS: Not selling on when the price drops $150+- doesn’t test your diamond 🙌... it’s when it goes to 10k 20k 30k and your staring at 300k 500k gains etc. that’s when the test will be. THIS STOCK CAN HIT BIG NUMBERS

Think of it this way: it is a know fact that shorts carry “ infinite risk”.... think about that... it’s saying when the the conditions are just so that the losses can be so big that they just say “infinite”.... now apes... I truly believe these conditions are “ just so” DO YOU?

TLDR: this is why they coined the term “infinite risk” on shorts.
