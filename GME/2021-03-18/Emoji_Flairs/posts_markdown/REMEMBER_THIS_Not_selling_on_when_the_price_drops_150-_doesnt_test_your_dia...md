Think of it this way: it is a know fact that shorts carry “ infinite risk”.... think about that... it’s saying when the the conditions are just so that the losses can be so big that they just say “infinite”.... now apes... I truly believe these conditions are “ just so” DO YOU?

TLDR: this is why they coined the term “infinite risk” on shorts.
