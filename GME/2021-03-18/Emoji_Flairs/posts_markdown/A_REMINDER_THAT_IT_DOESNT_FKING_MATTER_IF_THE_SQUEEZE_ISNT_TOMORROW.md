What we know, they know. Because of course this is Reddit. Power to everyone. A fair mechanism of gaining information and our beloved stocks GME and AMC. Think like your enemy for a second. You no longer have the financial power to make to price drop. The only way to attack would be psychological warfare. And what better way to hurt people then to use up all you got to make sure the squeeze doesn’t happen on the 19th tomorrow. Because people are getting excessively emotional it might hurt and they’ll wish that people start selling shares thinking it’s over and cause a sell off. WE CAN STAY MORE RETARDED THAN THEY CAN STAY POWERFUL. DONT FORGET. All I know is that tomorrow is going to be sooo volatile that it’ll use about almost all of their financial power. If it doesn’t happen tomorrow. It’ll happen very soon. Especially because next week also has a lot of events and stimulants too that will encourage buying. 

In conclusion: stay calm, every day we hold = every day we are winning. The promised day is near. HODL AND KEEP HODLING UNTIL THE SQUEEZE KICKS OFF
