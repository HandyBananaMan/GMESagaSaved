Stay patient. \n\nThrow your expectations out the door. \n\nEXPECT some weird shit to go down. \nEXPECT them to tank the price.\n\nThe price does not matter. We know it\u2019s a fake price. They have used fake or \u201csynthetic\u201d shares to drop the price.\n\nWhy you might ask? \n\nPsychological warfare. \n\nThey want to make it look unappealing. Or make it seem like this \u201crun\u201d is over. \n\n\u201cMaybe if we tank the price and spread a bunch of FUD, they will get bored, sell and move onto something else\u201d.\n\nThis ^ is their plan. \n\nI know this thanks to some of the AMAZING DD done by some great members of this group.\n\nIf you need, block out the noise. Turn off your phone. Don\u2019t worry about transferring your account. \n\nJust sit back and enjoy the ride. \n\nLove you all.
