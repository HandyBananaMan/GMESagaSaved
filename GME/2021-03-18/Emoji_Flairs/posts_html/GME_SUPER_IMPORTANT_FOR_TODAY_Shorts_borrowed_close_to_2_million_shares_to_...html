<h1>Title: <strong><em>GME: SUPER IMPORTANT FOR TODAY</em></strong> Shorts borrowed close to 2 million shares to short either today or tomorrow. FYI: $172 has been been an area of support the last two times they tried to tank it. Today they have to buy shares if people execute options, they need GME price as low as possible</h1>

<p>Can we call (Whales) them Kongs?</p>

<p>Yup, Whale  🐳  now =  Kongs  🦍</p>
<p><strong><em>Edit 7:   People seem to think this is FUD:  I wrote this premarket at like 9AM and had not even the slightest clue that it would somehow blow up.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I noticed shares were missing this morning across GME and all ETFs which I have been trying to track.  I wrote this to just make sure people were prepared if we see another sell off and not to worry if there was a dip.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The reason I think this is important is because if we tank tomorrow  and more puts are in the money...it can gamma squeeze the other way.  I'd much rather people be prepared ahead of time at the possibility of there being a drop because of the amount of shares borrow and what shorts may have been gathering up themselves to do a massive drop, than have unprepared people freak out and paper hand today or tomorrow.  I'd much rather know a dip was coming and be prepared for it.  Rather than be shocked like on 3/10 when we all of a sudden had 7 breakers trip and people weren't sure what was going on.</em></strong></p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Not a super long message but just some understand what might happen today.  Anything I post now almost immediately goes into the 80% because bots/shills so try to get this in front of people ASAP because they need to know not to freak out.</p>
<p><em>**I'm not 100% on this but please someone correct me or inform us if this is correct.  To my best understanding, today is the day that options contracts have to be bought by Chicago if executed.  This would mean they want as many options out of the money as possible.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>******* MOST IMPORTANT PART****** Expect this part:  They took out close to 2 million shares new shares to short with ETF's and this would not include ones they might have been buying on the open market with a different broker where they are "long" with that broker. To explain, say you short with 7 different brokers but the 8th broker you start buying 2 million shares long.  To that 8th broker, you (The Hedge Fund) are long so if you decide to slam bid a sell off (Meaning you don't wait for price improvement within the bid, just sell no matter what the price=Red Waterfall), now there is nothing fishy to them. To them you were long GME and just wanted out of your position, but the other 7, it helps your overall short position.  So you lose 200 million on one account but gain billions back on the other 7 accounts.</em></strong></p>
<p>**SEC when you read this, make sure you note what I'm saying....you know....rather than look at the Citadels of the world who are literally breaking laws in front of your faces.   But yeah, make sure you research me a guy down to his last pennies that he's put into this stock.  I just like the stock.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>********This means that even after they trigger a SSR, they will have another 2 million ETF shares to tank GME with after they are on SSR**)   This might make people think retail is selling off.  So they could have between 2-5 million shares they have been accumulating to make today look super ugly.  This combined with their high frequency trading, bid slamming, etc.  I completely expect they will slam the stock down in the next two days to make sure that the 160 200 up are out of the money*************************</strong></p>
<p>The shorts can't afford to keep having options turn into shares and keep going higher each week.  If you are on Robinhood, switch to cash TODAY if you want Robinhood to be forced to locate your shares if you are afraid to switch your account.  This would force Robinhood to actually buy your shares instead of an IOU which they are likely holding instead.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:  10:40AM *******NEW information for Robinhood Users:</strong>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time_to_launch_the_rocket_this_is_the_catalyst/"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time_to_launch_the_rocket_this_is_the_catalyst/</strong></a></p>
<p>They are saying this would force Robinhood to actually buy your shares instead of an IOU.  They seem to think this would be a catalyst.  Dunno but probably worth a shot and a read through.  I'm in the process of switching accounts with them.  So if this rockets to the moon now because of this and I'm still switching, pray it stays up for a while lol.</p>

<p>Just want people to be prepared if there is a dip.  The long ~~whales~~ Kongs were not with us yesterday **(Edit:  This does not mean I think Kongs are out.  I think they are waiting for something)</p>
<p>I personally think they want the shorts to reshort again and they want to keep this out of the 200s coming up on Tomorrow (Friday 3/19) since there is talk that some of the Shorts might have 200, 300, and 400 dollar calls which expire also tomorrow which they hedged weeks ago.</p>
<p>Pinning it lower than 200 would fuck the shorts the most since they would lose their hedge bets as well, then the long ~~whales~~ Kongs would proceed with buying up long again.  This was a theory I read  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m584h0/how_i_see_the_gme_end_game_playing_out/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m584h0/how_i_see_the_gme_end_game_playing_out/</a></p>
<p>He thinks ~~Whales~~ Kongs are waiting out this week because they want to keep the shorts from getting their hedge bets then will proceed next week.  I'm not putting dates at all but that would explain why ~~whales~~ Kongs seem to be MIA this week.</p>
<p>The other catalyst could be earnings coming up on March 23rd.  Not saying this is a date but something like good news could bring large institutional investors.</p>
<p>After Earnings, GME could start talking about what they are doing for future plans.  I think they are gag ordered because of earnings which someone just confirmed in the comment section!</p>
<p>Please get this in front of people so they know what is going on today and tomorrow!</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>  Not FUD just wanted Apes to be prepared if their was a sale.  <strong>Just Buy and Hold</strong>.  Heroes of GME mentioned in Edit #5.  Yup, Long Whales  🐳  = Long Kongs  🦍.  Tomorrow can gamma squeeze either way.  Explained how shorts could be picking up shares long (Then mass sell them off) then sell them at a magic time like on 3/10.  ETF's can be shorted even if SSR is triggered.  Think the Long Kongs 🦍 are waiting for something, could be earnings or tomorrow.  Not sure.</p>
<p>If you can better summarize, I'll post it and give you credit lol</p>
