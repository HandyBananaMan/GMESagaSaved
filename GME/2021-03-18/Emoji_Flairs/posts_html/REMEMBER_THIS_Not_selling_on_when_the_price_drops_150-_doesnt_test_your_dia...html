<h1>Title: REMEMBER THIS: Not selling on when the price drops $150+- doesn’t test your diamond 🙌... it’s when it goes to 10k 20k 30k and your staring at 300k 500k gains etc. that’s when the test will be. THIS STOCK CAN HIT BIG NUMBERS</h1>

<p>Think of it this way: it is a know fact that shorts carry “ infinite risk”.... think about that... it’s saying when the the conditions are just so that the losses can be so big that they just say “infinite”.... now apes... I truly believe these conditions are “ just so” DO YOU?</p>
<p>TLDR: this is why they coined the term “infinite risk” on shorts. </p>
