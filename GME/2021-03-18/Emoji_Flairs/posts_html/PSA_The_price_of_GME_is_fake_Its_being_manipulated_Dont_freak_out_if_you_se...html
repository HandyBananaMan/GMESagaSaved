<p>The game is rigged. We all know this. </p>
<p>Shorts know it too. They know about March 19th. </p>
<p>DO NOT GET HUNG UP ON DATES.</p>
<p>The time will come. The catalyst will come. Stay patient. </p>
<p>Throw your expectations out the door. </p>
<p>EXPECT some weird shit to go down. 
EXPECT them to tank the price.</p>
<p>The price does not matter. We know it’s a fake price. They have used fake or “synthetic” shares to drop the price.</p>
<p>Why you might ask? </p>
<p>Psychological warfare. </p>
<p>They want to make it look unappealing. Or make it seem like this “run” is over. </p>
<p>“Maybe if we tank the price and spread a bunch of FUD, they will get bored, sell and move onto something else”.</p>
<p>This ^ is their plan. </p>
<p>I know this thanks to some of the AMAZING DD done by some great members of this group.</p>
<p>If you need, block out the noise. Turn off your phone. Don’t worry about transferring your account. </p>
<p>Just sit back and enjoy the ride. </p>
<p>Love you all. Stay patient </p>
