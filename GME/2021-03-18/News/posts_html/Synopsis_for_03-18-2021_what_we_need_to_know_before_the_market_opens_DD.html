<p>Good morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole,</p>
<p>Who threw Robinhood and citadel under the bus?</p>
<p>*insert flashy intro card*</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/o140x9a2brn61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b869dc81e840b3c15161f40a9f655a9cdc9765f2</p>
<p>Remember this is not in any way shape or form financial advice.</p>
<h1>Godlike DD</h1>
<p>So some members have indeed seen that the godlike DD we got yesterday was moved, it's new (and hopefully remaining) location is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/">https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Know that this is V11, this is a still ongoing research into this entire situation, so expect it to change and it adapting as all good thesis it changes because of feedback.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Anyone want some new GameStop?</h1>
<p>Ok so remember how I was talking about GameStop could change into a new social hub and turn around what it was into something that is totally different.</p>
<p>Yeah it's happening! some awesome apes have taken some videos and pictures of how the new stores will look!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m79jjv/confirmation_bias_for_you_more_pics_from_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">pictures</a></p>

<p>See those gaming chairs? great for E-sports or lan parties like the old days, place to chill and card games? man count me in!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So GameStop is moving into a new type of business, this is evident in the way that their business is changing from brick and mortar "buy my games and gtfo" to "buy the game or just chill" this in itself will lead to bigger streams of revenue, if you for example look at "Friday night magic" (magic the gathering get togethers) they could sell more drinks and small things to "oh i'm here anyway might as well pick up X videogame/collectable/cards/anything they offer"</p>
<p>this with the new push to digital means that it's no longer speculation that the old GameStop is dead, it's becoming fact that a new type of business, a customer centric business has risen from it's ashes.</p>

<h1>The hearing</h1>
<p>Ok can someone go check on Robinhood and Citadel, because they'll need some help getting out from under that bus.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://reddit.com/link/m7o6d3/video/23eegby3ern61/player</p>
<p>First of all mr Dennis Kelleher is spitting some hard facts.</p>
<p>Remember in the god tier DD, it shows that the FTD's are in a cyclical nature.</p>
<p>With the statements made yesterday we now know that we have this exact thing happen, because all they need is a "reasonable belief" to think they can deliver that stock, I really hope the SEC and the Government in general focusses more on this and adopts a European like law saying "if you don't have it you can't do it" because with "reasonable belief"... man just imagine if we had this rule with taxes or anything for that matter.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/39nwid9rlrn61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e57c144af410c78e720ae1afc6a5f3508e2463d</p>
<p>"sir why did you steal that car?'"oh no because I believed it was mine, I have a reasonable belief I can return this in time""...very well sir please be careful"</p>
<p>Also some other important things that came to light in the senate hearing;</p>
<p><strong>"Citadel securities is not a systemically significant firm, and FSOC should investigate it...." MR. DENNIS KELLEHER</strong></p>
<p>They said flat out, if Citadel stopped to exist RIGHT NOW it would stop about 26% of us equities, which sounds a lot but look at GME how many times have they "bought and sold" the same shares over and over again, Volume does not equate to business nor profit nor importance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7e8xk/dennis_kellehers_testimony_is_an_eyeopening/">Dennis Kelleher full testimony</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://reddit.com/link/m7o6d3/video/heodqguzfrn61/player</p>
<p>Now this lady, Ms. Alexis Goldstein she has a god damn wrinkly brain.</p>
<p>she has made some very good facts on how there may be some loopholes in the system that people like citadel could be using to their advantage. we have seen the same happen with the rule of daily to monthly reports of the SEC.</p>
<p>it's something they could say "oh you say monthly? but this one says daily so these are contradicting so I don't have to comply" Remember folks no one stays on top with huge businesses and lots of capital by playing nice.</p>
<p>The only thing I didn't like about the hearing is the fact that they focused on the wrong thing, we don't have a payment-for-order problem, we have a naked/synthetic/shorting-problem.</p>
<p>Seriously if they can't see that GameStop's entire thing is a literal showcase on why short selling is a problem if left unregulated then I don't think anyone in that senate should be there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://reddit.com/link/m7o6d3/video/t4moaqyfjrn61/player</p>
<p>hmmm that makes my noggin think....</p>
<p>SEC is looking close in to Citatadel short selling. Big indication of abusive short selling ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm missing some other facts here and I'll add them here over time (i'm sure my fellow apes don't mind raising some good points as always ðŸ˜‰)</p>

<h1>Robinhood never had your shares</h1>
<p>yup this may as well be as Fud as it gets, just set your account to cash as stated here:<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time_to_launch_the_rocket_this_is_the_catalyst/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time_to_launch_the_rocket_this_is_the_catalyst/</a></p>
<p>This forces them to buy the buy the stocks as far as I know</p>
<p>posted in comments by u/AdInternational975</p>
<pre><code>Remember when you convert to a RH cash account, once you sell, the funds have to settle for 3 days before you can reinvest them again. Itâ€™s different than RH Instant. So be sure you want to sell when you hit that button because you wonâ€™t be able to buy back in immediately if needed. You can invest any other settled funds just not the ones that have to clear. Iâ€™ve been a cash account since this all started. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE CONVERTING TO CASH ACCOUNTS TO KNOW! Hope it helps.

This will be another added factor as to why you should HODL! This is not financial advice in any way.

<h1>Negative beta</h1>
<p>Now in the pas few days something funny happened, reddit found out that due to the negative beta GME is reacting inversely to the market (meaning market go's up gme go's down and vice versa).Funny how we posted about that yesterday and I saw someone on here post that it "suddenly" corrected itself.</p>
<p>Now I'm the first to admit I don't have the exact technical knowledge to know whether or not this is normal behavior</p>
<p>But a smart ape did do a writeup on why the negative beta isn't as important as we first did believe</p>

<h1>A one two punch k.o. is comming.</h1>
<p>u/heyitspixel did a great writeup on the new DTCC ruling and it's implications.</p>
<p>The new dtcc rules: <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-003-Approval-Notice.pdf">https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-003-Approval-Notice.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m793h7/new_dtcc_rule_just_passed_in_effect_immediatly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">pixels post</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The great take-away from this post is written by  u/swede_child_of_mine</p>
<pre><code>This is probably punch one of the one-two punch from DTCC against Citadel &amp; 
naked options sellers (NOS's).

Because this rule is effective immediately, Citadel &amp; NOS need to report 
to DTCC what their positions are, because you better believe DTCC didn't 
change this rule to not use it.

Punch two comes after either Citadel &amp; NOS:

1) Refuse to comply with the new rule

2) Comply and reveal to DTCC the really ugly truthful numbers of their operations

At that point, the DTCC will quickly turn to its stakeholders with strong cause to immediately pass SR-NSCC-2021-801 - the rule which would allow the DTCC to liquidate problematic firms whose operations expose the broader market to systemic damages.

DTCC's interest might be in getting ahead of the next series of options writing, because it sees the damage exposure being brought by the NOSs.
</code></pre>
<p>ok but what about option 3? they lie?</p>
<pre><code>Yep. But my guess is DTCC has the receipts of Citadel &amp; NOS's shenanigans. 
There is too much data available to cover with a compelling lie, 
especially to the people who are executing all of their securities trades.

My guess is: DTCC knew they might lie and already has a compelling case 
for grounds for their liquidations, which the bad actors can't lie their way out of.
Even if they attempt to lie, the DTCC will turn around and say 
"These guys lied and are not complying. This is even more cause to liquidate."

Either way, I think the DTCC might be the biggest player in this whole thing, 
and wants to get ahead of the next round of options issuance.
</code></pre>
<p>And I have to agree, everything I've seen from the new DTCC rules lines up with my beliefs that they are hedging their bets (see what I did there?) to make sure they're the ones who get out alive and well from this situation and Citadel is the one who's going to go down for their own problems.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>
<p>Someone commented beneath pixel with some counter as to how it should be viewed, which is great!  u/the_captain_slog <strong>posted:</strong></p>
<pre><code>I agree that this a good thing for the implications on the liquidity deposits,
 but your analysis is backwards.

"DTC provides regular reports and statements to Participants showing their
 settlement activity; this includes activity, risk control monitoring and
 settlement reports. The Procedures of DTC require Participants to reconcile 
both their activity and positions with DTC upon receipt of applicable daily
 activity statements at the end of each day and to immediately report any
 discrepancies. Participants must also provide a month-end confirmation of 
their activity."

The statements flow from DTCC to the hedge funds/participants. 
It was not the hedge funds/participants providing statements once a month.

Think of this like a bank statement. Your bank shows you online what all of 
your activity is now on a daily basis, so you don't need to wait for a 
month-end statement anymore (even though those are provided electronically 
as well).

Participants / hedge funds are now responsible to confirm the accuracy of 
their statements and provide reconciliations of discrepancies daily:

"It is the sole responsibility of Participants to perform a daily reconciliation
of their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements
provided by DTC. Participants must immediately report to DTC any discrepancy
between their activity and positions with the information, 
reports and statements provided by DTC or other issues relating to the accuracy of the information, reports and statements provided by DTC."

Here is the big part: This monthly confirmation had to happen 
"no later than the 10th business day after the last Friday of the month." 
It's very likely that they're now removing the buffer so they can do 
the margin calls quicker. Before, there was a reasonable cover that 
existed of "Oh, I haven't reviewed and confirmed my statement yet." 
Now, that no longer exists. 
They also now have daily confirmed statements showing any potential 
issues / weaknesses that exist so they can do the margin calls on 
more of a real-time basis.

<h1>Patience is key</h1>
<p>Ok so now we are closing up on the 19th the "mystical" witching day, this has been hyped up so much so expect it to go down. expect fuckery as always.</p>
<p>Expect the 19th to be the lowest day we have since yet seen.</p>
<p>Why am I saying this?</p>
<p>Easy, if we know the date THEY know the date.</p>
<p>all you need to do is sit back relax, get some nacho's for the dip and sit back.</p>
<p>This can take days, weeks or months.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Burry had to wait 2 years for it to come out and his calculations to get paid out.</p>
<p>Expect the same, because if you expect the worst it can only get better.</p>

<p>you know why? because we are friends.</p>
<p>Nothing matters, only thing that matters is simple</p>
<p>Apes dont fight Apes</p>
