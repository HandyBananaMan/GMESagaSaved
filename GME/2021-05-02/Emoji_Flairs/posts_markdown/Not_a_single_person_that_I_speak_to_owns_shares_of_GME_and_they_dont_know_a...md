Is it just my experience? I'll admit I have a small group of people that I interact with, however if someone else talked to them about GME I am sure they would've had some reaction. Even a couple people who are "hip" to the stock market are not looking into the situation surrounding Gamestop, despite having prior knowledge of shorting and naked shorting...

This strikes me as odd, albeit I have skipped a few days of crayons in my diet. If it is so, this truly is a once in a timeline event and my ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ will never shatter.

What about you apes? Do you know many people aware of what is happening to GME, or do I need to eat my crayons again?
