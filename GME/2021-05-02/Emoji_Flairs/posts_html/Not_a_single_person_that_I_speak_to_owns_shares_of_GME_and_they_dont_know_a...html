<h1>Title: Not a single person that I speak to owns shares of GME, and they don't know anything other than what MSM have told them</h1>

<p>Is it just my experience? I'll admit I have a small group of people that I interact with, however if someone else talked to them about GME I am sure they would've had some reaction. Even a couple people who are "hip" to the stock market are not looking into the situation surrounding Gamestop, despite having prior knowledge of shorting and naked shorting...</p>
<p>This strikes me as odd, albeit I have skipped a few days of crayons in my diet. If it is so, this truly is a once in a timeline event and my ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ will never shatter.</p>
<p>What about you apes? Do you know many people aware of what is happening to GME, or do I need to eat my crayons again?</p>
