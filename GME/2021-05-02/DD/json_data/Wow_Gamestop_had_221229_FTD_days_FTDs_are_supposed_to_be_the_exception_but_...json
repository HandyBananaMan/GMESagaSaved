FTDs are supposed to be the exception, but clearly getting exploited. SEC, begging you, pls pls pls Do your job for the people please!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gmeimmortan/status/1383183571955892227?s=21\n\nSomeone on twitter tried to download FTD for Mar/2021 and said:\u201dI got 198 days and I couldn't even import March 2021 because Excel ran out of rows\u201d:\nhttps://twitter.com/philip_ng/status/1383150544664076293?s=21\n\nAnd got:\nhttps://twitter.com/philip_ng/status/1383160951277551624?s=21\n\nAnd this:\nhttps://twitter.com/gmeshortsqueeze/status/1383174836885798912?s=21\n\nWow!\n\n\n\n\n\nApe Andy, just thinking out loud in text form:\n\n\u201cGee Wiz I mean NOBODY at the SEC noticed this and thought \u201chmm might be something fishy here?\u201d \nWow! The officials at SEC must be really really busy folks at work on something else more important, I guess?!?\u201d\n\n\nIf only someone could contact their congressman or senator and ask them to pls ask the new SEC Director Gensler to help make a change!\n\nThe witnesses for this next congressional-hearing for market volatility includes:\n\nHonorable Gary Gensler, Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \n\nMichael Bodson, President and Chief Executive Officer, the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation \n\nRobert Cook, President and Chief Executive Officer, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc\n\nThe virtual hearing will be held on May 6 at 12:00 PM ET.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n2l9fp/third_committee_hearing_on_market_volatility/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nComments from u/OneLifeCycle:\n\n\u201cAfter the squeeze, I'm pulling out of the market until real, believable, actionable changes are made.\n\n\nThis shit is CORRUPT and it's all because the governing bodies themselves are CORRUPT. The deck is stacked against us and I'm not going to become another one of their financial victims. FUCK THE SEC.\u201d",
