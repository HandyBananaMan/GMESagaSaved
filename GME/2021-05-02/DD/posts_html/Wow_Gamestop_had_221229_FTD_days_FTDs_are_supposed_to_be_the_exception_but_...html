<p>have every respect for SEC! With all due respect to SEC, this is just a humble reminder of FTD issue.</p>
<p>Gamestop had 221/229 FTD days </p>

<p>this is pure market manipulation. FTDs are supposed to be the exception, but clearly getting exploited. SEC, begging you, pls pls pls Do your job for the people please!</p>

<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Ape Andy, just thinking out loud in text form:</p>
<p>“Gee Wiz I mean NOBODY at the SEC noticed this and thought “hmm might be something fishy here?” 
Wow! The officials at SEC must be really really busy folks at work on something else more important, I guess?!?”</p>
<p>If only someone could contact their congressman or senator and ask them to pls ask the new SEC Director Gensler to help make a change!</p>

<p>Comments from u/OneLifeCycle:</p>
<p>“After the squeeze, I'm pulling out of the market until real, believable, actionable changes are made.</p>
<p>This shit is CORRUPT and it's all because the governing bodies themselves are CORRUPT. The deck is stacked against us and I'm not going to become another one of their financial victims. FUCK THE SEC.”</p>
