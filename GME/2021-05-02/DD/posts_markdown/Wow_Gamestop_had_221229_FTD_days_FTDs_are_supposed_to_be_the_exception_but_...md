Wow!





Ape Andy, just thinking out loud in text form:

“Gee Wiz I mean NOBODY at the SEC noticed this and thought “hmm might be something fishy here?” 
Wow! The officials at SEC must be really really busy folks at work on something else more important, I guess?!?”


If only someone could contact their congressman or senator and ask them to pls ask the new SEC Director Gensler to help make a change!

The witnesses for this next congressional-hearing for market volatility includes:

Honorable Gary Gensler, Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 

Michael Bodson, President and Chief Executive Officer, the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation 

Robert Cook, President and Chief Executive Officer, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc

The virtual hearing will be held on May 6 at 12:00 PM ET.

Comments from u/OneLifeCycle:

“After the squeeze, I'm pulling out of the market until real, believable, actionable changes are made.


This shit is CORRUPT and it's all because the governing bodies themselves are CORRUPT. The deck is stacked against us and I'm not going to become another one of their financial victims. FUCK THE SEC.”
