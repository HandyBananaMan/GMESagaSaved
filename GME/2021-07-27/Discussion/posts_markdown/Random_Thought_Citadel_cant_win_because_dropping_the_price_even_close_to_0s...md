With a Buy:Sell of 4:1 almost every day, such low volume, so many people HODLing, the GME price reaching a price point even close to $0 would be solid proof that the market is manipulated by Wall St and the market makers/Billionaires that fraudulently gamble with our money are guilty. 

Therefor another reason as to why we cannot lose.
