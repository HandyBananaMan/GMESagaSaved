<p>Most of you might have noticed a significant increase in GameStop related LinkedIn posts that address synthetic shares, FTD's and other topics of high relevance that have been discussed extensively over the past months. This trend has resonated very positively with the vast majority of shareholders on major subs, mainly because LinkedIn is considered a more credible and professional platform than other social media. I actually believe that this is yet another way of shooting ourselves in the foot on top of many other sloppy mistakes I've increasingly observed in the recent past.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning</em></strong>: If you can't handle being confronted with uncomfortable facts and are just looking for confirmation bias, please feel free to downvote this post and move on since I'm not selling any Hopium. Anyone who is genuinely concerned about the wellbeing and credibility of this investor community, I'd love for you to keep reading and share thoughts in the comments, whether negative or positive. Nothing healthier than an open-minded exchange of opinions and ideas.</p>
<p><strong>The Ugly Truth about LinkedIn</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, LinkedIn is not even close to being the mature, professional and educational networking platform that various people think it is. If anything, this type of social media has brought to light the attention-seeking, impulsive, childish and overall quite pathetic nature of grown adults including those that sit in senior roles within some of the largest global footprint companies.</p>
<p>In case you wonder why I'm so comfortable making this claim: I work in business development and rely almost fully on identifying clients and otherwise useful contacts through LinkedIn. Most of my days begin and finish with logging into my account, scrolling the news feed to monitor any interesting activity from prospects, building lists through key-word searches and connecting with clients and peers. What makes my work really hard is scrolling through endless posts of people either making up or copying and pasting (again, made up) stories about exaggerated acts of generosity, interactions with their kids that most likely never happened, jumping on popular narratives or trends that fit exactly into what the majority of the public wants to hear and even, believe it or not, random pictures with a red circle in the middle and the caption "like and share to see what happens!". If you think that people fishing for points on Reddit is bad, you haven't witnessed LinkedIn users begging for attention and desperately trying to gain popularity and validation, often by "blowing their own horn".</p>
<p>The point that I'm trying to make is that a shocking number of LinkedIn users that are addressing this very important topic do it for no other reason than attracting attention and increasing their chances of becoming yet another LinkedIn influencer / thinkfluencer. They clearly identified a large audience for this kind of information and will shape their content through phrases and buzzwords in order to appear as likable and relatable as possible to the large number of GME investors looking to confirm their bias.</p>
<p>What makes this whole affair even more concerning is the fact that the overwhelming majority of GameStop related content on LinkedIn is anything but informative and sometimes very misleading. These users very rarely bring any new information or educational insights to the table and instead repeat what has been said already and often challenged by more educated individuals on Reddit, therefore offering no value to anyone whatsoever. Essentially all of the posts that have been screenshotted and shared on here or on SuperStonk recently were a mere regurgitation of oversimplified data and conclusions, often revealing a shocking lack of understanding from the creator of the posts.</p>
<p>However, most of my frustration comes from the thousands of users who celebrate people posting GME content on LinkedIn even though these individuals are in no way whatsoever qualified to lead the type of conversations we are trying to have, The fact that they are posting on LinkedIn rather than Reddit seems more than satisfactory to a lot of people in order to consider the given information as credible and valuable.</p>
<p>One of the examples that come to mind is a gentleman on LinkedIn named Tom: I'd like to clarify early on that I have no problem with the man at all and appreciate his interest and passion for this topic. I also believe that he has every right in the world to share his thoughts on LinkedIn. What I do have a problem with, however, is thousands of people liking, sharing and overall glorifying his opinions, again, simply because he is posting on a platform that is largely considered as serious and professional. If I remember correctly his job title is "After Hours Password Technician Lead" and I am sure he is bringing very important skills to the market and provides unique expertise in his field. That being said, unless he has a secret background in finance that I am not aware of, his opinion is literally worth as much as mine or yours and should not be put on a pedestal like many people are doing. I'm sure Tom agrees.</p>
<p>Another individual I'd like to mention is Peter Hann: Again, no hard feelings towards this gentleman whatsoever, Peter actually has a professional background that does indeed give him more credibility than others. What I did notice though is that he is more prudent with his claims while simultaneously designing his posts in a way to, as we like to say here, jack people's tits. My perception is that Peter is keeping himself off the hook in order to gain engagement and popularity but without running the risk of being held responsible for any kind of incorrect data or other insights he is sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Why we are scoring an own-goal instead of hitting the home-run</strong></p>
<p>The general thought I've observed is that moving this conversation to LinkedIn will help with attracting people that add more credibility and resources to the community of investors while raising awareness on fraudulent market activity outside of Reddit. I agree with this thought or at least with the potential of this happening to a certain extent. However, on a larger scale, we are actually fuelling the growing negative reputation of GME investors being financially illiterate, overly impulsive and overall not credible. What certainly does not help is the fact that the comments under some of the most irritating LinkedIn posts are not from people challenging and correcting certain claims but instead consist in the usual rocket emoji's, apes together strong and "to the moon". This makes GameStop investors look shockingly ignorant and strongly damages the actual reputation of the company: A business is just as credible as the people that invest in it.</p>
<p>If anything, I believe that calling out misinformation whenever appropriate (and recently there is an overwhelming amount of false or misleading information being shared) is by far the best thing to strengthen the base of GameStop investors and the company itself. If we want big players to join the party we need to ensure that places where the stock is being discussed don't appear as a combination between a kindergarten and a lunatic asylum. Increasing this negative perception specifically on LinkedIn hurts everyone and helps nobody.</p>
<p>Once again, I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments and many thanks for making it this far.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p><em>GME related information being posted on LinkedIn does not automatically make it valuable and credible. LinkedIn users that create echo chambers and are actually in no way qualified to share their 'expertise' should not be rewarded with attention and engagement. This kind of behaviour hurts investors and the company. Call out BS where you see it and be aware of people hijacking the narrative for their own benefit.</em></p>
