<p>I know a lot of you ARE in fact doing this and that's pretty fucking sweet, kudos to you! Apes together strong!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For the rest of you:</p>
<p>With Pro membership only costing $15 but giving you $5 free every month, it pays for itself and then some. Or heck, get yourself a gaming magazine subscription for $20. Or some cool BOGO moon shirts, GameStop has loads of goodies aside from vidya gainz!</p>
<p>What's up? Do you NOT want to get GME onto the S&amp;P by helping it have ANOTHER stellar earnings quarter? You DO realize how much better that would be... don't you?</p>
<p>Heck, most of what you order will get to you same day too, so you get to enjoy it right away!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Granted. Some of you literally can't order anything from GameStop yet, and I really hope they get that sorted ASAP. But... what's up with the rest of you?</p>

<p><strong><em>This is NOT a call to action or a rallying cry, I just really want to know: what's your reasoning?</em></strong></p>
