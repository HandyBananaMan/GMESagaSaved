# Title: This is not a call to action, or a rally, but: Mark Cuban, said it best, if you truly want to make a difference.. then support the company as well as buying the stock, it's simple, really. A stock right now is $200+ you're telling me you can't afford a $15 pro membership? Sus.

I know a lot of you ARE in fact doing this and that's pretty fucking sweet, kudos to you! Apes together strong!

For the rest of you:

With Pro membership only costing $15 but giving you $5 free every month, it pays for itself and then some. Or heck, get yourself a gaming magazine subscription for $20. Or some cool BOGO moon shirts, GameStop has loads of goodies aside from vidya gainz!

What's up? Do you NOT want to get GME onto the S&P by helping it have ANOTHER stellar earnings quarter? You DO realize how much better that would be... don't you?

Heck, most of what you order will get to you same day too, so you get to enjoy it right away!

Granted. Some of you literally can't order anything from GameStop yet, and I really hope they get that sorted ASAP. But... what's up with the rest of you?

***This is NOT a call to action or a rallying cry, I just really want to know: what's your reasoning?***
