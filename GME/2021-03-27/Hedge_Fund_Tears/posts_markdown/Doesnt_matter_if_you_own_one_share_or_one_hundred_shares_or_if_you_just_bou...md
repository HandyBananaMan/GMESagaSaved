STRAP IN APES. But seriously GOOD FUCKING JOB - you saved one of the only remaining video game retailers from going under, and not just from going under; you saved them from being bled dry by soulless billionaires. YOU SAVED THEM FROM BEING PUT OUT OF BUSINESS BY YOUR CHILDHOOD BASKETBALL HERO FOR FUCK SAKE. 

This is all fucked, but YOU had a hand in saving GME and now she’s giving back in the most gratuitous way imaginable.
