<p>STRAP IN APES. But seriously GOOD FUCKING JOB - you saved one of the only remaining video game retailers from going under, and not just from going under; you saved them from being bled dry by soulless billionaires. YOU SAVED THEM FROM BEING PUT OUT OF BUSINESS BY YOUR CHILDHOOD BASKETBALL HERO FOR FUCK SAKE. </p>
<p>This is all fucked, but YOU had a hand in saving GME and now she’s giving back in the most gratuitous way imaginable. </p>
<p>Launch sequence engaged. 👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
