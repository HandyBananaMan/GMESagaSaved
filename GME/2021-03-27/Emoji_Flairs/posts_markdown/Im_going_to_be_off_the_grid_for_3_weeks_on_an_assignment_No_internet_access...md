If this takes off when i’m gone, I dont want to get back and see that it squeezed to 500k before everyone paperhanded it back down and I missed the whole thing. Do me a solid and stick to you diamond hand word. 

Edit: To be honest i’m not worried, I have a lot of faith in this community. Plus if this takes off I genuinely see it hitting $10M
