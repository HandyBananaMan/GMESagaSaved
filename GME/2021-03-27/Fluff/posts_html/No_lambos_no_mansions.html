<p>I don't care about fancy cars or mega mansions. I want the freedom to live. I want to spend months traveling the country visiting the national parks and wilderness areas. Just me and my dog chilling out. Maybe rent a sprinter van to travel in. I just want to have all the money I need to explore the country with no constraints. Maybe bring a couple people along. Eventually find a place to buy something modest to call home base and continue traveling full time off my dividends and reinvestments</p>
<p>It doesn't sound fancy but travel is the ultimate freedom to do whatever you want</p>
