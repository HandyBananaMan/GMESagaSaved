**Tl;dr** 🚀 🔜 🌙

Get ready for the biggest, and possibly only, true transfer of wealth in modern history.

My grandmother will get her personal assistant, my mother gets to retire and enjoy life. 

I know this is just another “what if..” post, but since I am **100% convinced** that the squeeze will happen sooner than we think, I feel it’s starting to make sense to actually plan on how you want to distribute your funds after taxes.
