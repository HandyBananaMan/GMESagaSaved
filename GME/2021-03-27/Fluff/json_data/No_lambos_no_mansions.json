    "selftext": "I don't care about fancy cars or mega mansions. I want the freedom to live. I want to spend months traveling the country visiting the national parks and wilderness areas. Just me and my dog chilling out. Maybe rent a sprinter van to travel in. I just want to have all the money I need to explore the country with no constraints. Maybe bring a couple people along. Eventually find a place to buy something modest to call home base and continue traveling full time off my dividends and reinvestments\n\nIt doesn't sound fancy but travel is the ultimate freedom to do whatever you want",
