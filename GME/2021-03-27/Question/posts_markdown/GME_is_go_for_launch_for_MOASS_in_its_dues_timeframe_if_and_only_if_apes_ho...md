Ape Andy could be wrong but I think it is starting to take shape, pls scroll and read comments about Goldman Sachs:

GameStop is go for launch for its MOASS in its dues timeframe. This is only if we hold on to GME shares. However, if we donâ€™t waste ammo on call options which may go OTM, rather use the ammo to buy actual shares of GME, the MOASS timeframe may be moved to an earlier time!

Also:
If you just hold, GME will do for MOASS launch in due time.
If you buy more, MOASS launch timeframe moves to earlier timeframe !

Why? Hedge funds are on the verge of margin calls!
One HF had its margin called already by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley:

Why did this situation happen? And why it will keep happening:

Also smart apes posted about big banks like Goldman Sachs will keep pulling the plug on HF:
