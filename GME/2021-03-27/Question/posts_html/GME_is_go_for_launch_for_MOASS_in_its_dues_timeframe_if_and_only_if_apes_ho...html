<h1>Title: GME is go for launch for MOASS in its dues timeframe if and only if apes hold on to GME shares. Moreover, if apes don’t waste ammo on call options which may go OTM, but rather buy actual shares of GME, the MOASS timeframe may be moved to an earlier time! Do you agree or disagree? Pls comment!</h1>

<p>Ape Andy could be wrong but I think it is starting to take shape, pls scroll and read comments about Goldman Sachs:

<p>GameStop is go for launch for its MOASS in its dues timeframe. This is only if we hold on to GME shares. However, if we don’t waste ammo on call options which may go OTM, rather use the ammo to buy actual shares of GME, the MOASS timeframe may be moved to an earlier time!</p>

<p>Also:
If you just hold, GME will do for MOASS launch in due time.
If you buy more, MOASS launch timeframe moves to earlier timeframe !</p>
<p>Why? Hedge funds are on the verge of margin calls!
One HF had its margin called already by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley:

<p>Why did this situation happen? And why it will keep happening:

<p>Also smart apes posted about big banks like Goldman Sachs will keep pulling the plug on HF:
