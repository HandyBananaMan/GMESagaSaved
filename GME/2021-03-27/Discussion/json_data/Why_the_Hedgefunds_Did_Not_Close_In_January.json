    "selftext": "I have been seeing a lot of people say \"I would have settled for $1,000 a share in January, the Hedgefunds should have just ended it then\". It was very clearly going into the thousands as multiple experts had attested to that in the congressional hearings and various interviews. However, the reason I think they did not close out the shorts then is because they were going to be financially ruined either way. Everyone here knows if this this thing blows up passed $1,000 a share we are dependent on the DTCC to to pay us. Hell, Mets owner ,Steve Cohen ,almost got margin called at $340, and he was the only one I believe who actually closed. It's amazing those that the HF are so psychotic that if they lose, they're making sure everyone else goes down with them. Them going bankrupt is not acceptable in their book, but them going bankrupt and dragging down the economy is perfectly acceptable. \n\n\nWhat does everyone else think? Are they really this evil?",
