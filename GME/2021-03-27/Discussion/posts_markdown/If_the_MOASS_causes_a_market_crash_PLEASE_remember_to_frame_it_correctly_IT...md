Thanks for reading. I like the fucking stock. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Edit: to those saying it won't crash the market, have you seen what happens when we start going parabolic? The market starts bleeding out of its eyes. What is GME's beta value at right now, anyway? Still -8? 


It's like SOME of you don't even want the squeeze to happen. Weird.

Edit2:
Wow, #2 on my favorite subreddit. I am a warm and fuzzy ape. Thanks for the awards!

I wanted to clarify something I posted in my first edit about beta value. First type in negative beta in google and you get this:

"A negative beta correlation means an investment moves in the opposite direction from the stock market. When the market rises, a negative-beta investment generally falls. When the market falls, the negative-beta investment will tend to rise."

[Here is some DD about GME's beta value from 2 weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/m6g8u4/extremely_abnormal_negative_beta_of_gme_evidence/) Long story short GME's beta was -2.07 on 03/17 and I got the same value when I looked for it just now. What it means to me is that when GME goes BRRRRRRRR market goes GUHHHHH. Smarter apes can explain the deeper mechanics and nuance but that is it in a nutshell.

INFINITY EDIT:
