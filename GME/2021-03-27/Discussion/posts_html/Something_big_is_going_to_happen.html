<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>Morgan Stanly seems also liquiditing securities</p>
<p>“More of the unregistered stock offerings were said to be managed by Morgan Stanley, according to people familiar with the matter, on behalf of one or more undisclosed shareholders. Some of the trades exceeded $1 billion in individual companies, calculations based on Bloomberg data show.”</p>
