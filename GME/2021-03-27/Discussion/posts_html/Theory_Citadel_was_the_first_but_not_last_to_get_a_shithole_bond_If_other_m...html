<p>***Important clarification which I made in an edit at the bottom but will add here as well. Please consider that if this theory lends any credibility it may just further explain how the market could crash when GME moons. This does not mean the economy will also tank. This is an important distinction which some astute, wrinkle brained apes have pointed out.***</p>

<p>I was just about ready to get some work done on this nice Saturday morning but I couldn't stop thinking about this post I saw on here last night. Mainly, it talked about some of the large institutions involved in all of this and speculated that a fund called Jane Street Capital is likely one of Shitadel and Uncle Melvin's sibling that has been flying under the radar. Post is now deleted by mods for some reason but here is the link if anyone wants to gather anything from the comments. Basically, it was just a fun read.</p>

<p>But anyways...it got me thinking about how, like many of you, I have been astonished how these hf fucks and corrupt MMs have not bled out yet. We all know they haven't just doubled down but they will CONTINUE to do so until they are ALL IN and have FAILED. And they will fail.</p>
<p>Why do we know this? Take for example the $600 million in bonds Citadel got approved for with their asshole BBB rating. Now I'm not an expert on ANY of this shit. I work as a doctor and while I feel capable of teaching myself most things the only financial/economic knowledge I have is from taking a fucking AP ECON class in highschool (which is actually one of the only AP classes I passed lol). But just like all of you I've been consumed by this shit for over two months and have learned more than I ever thought possible (credit to all you wrinkle ass brained apes out there).</p>
<p>HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW THOUGH:</p>
<p>Citadel applies for a $600 million bond when they are absolutely, definitively, royally about to get fucked by some smooth brained apes.</p>
<p>Whats a bond and whats the big deal with Citadel getting one? Don't a lot of corporations apply for those? Like I said...I don't know dick about finance. But what my smooth non-ridged brain knows is - bond = loan. For any of you who don't know - currently there is immense concern about am impending recession/market collapse because of a bubble in the corporate bond market! When did this bubble start getting inflated? The last time these institutions wanted to fuck with us in 2008 and started repackaging adjustable mortages into the fucking bag of shit "Synthetic CDOs" causing the banks that were "too big to fail" to get massive injections of money from the fed.</p>
<p>So what's happened since? Well, a bunch of Zombie Companies, which are basically companies that are only making interest payments and not investing in their business or employees, have been getting a fuck ton of bonds (that are absolute shit) at REALLY LOW INTEREST RATES (sound familiar? hint hint housing market crash and the shitty adjustable mortages that caused it). This has been going on since 2008 and right now it is a MASSIVE bubble. The Fed has massive decisions to do about interest rates and long story short the bond market is pretty much fucked no matter what. So what's going to make that shit pop??? Could it be GME?</p>
<p>Anyways, back to Shitadel and co. We KNOW Kenny G has decided that they are too far gone and will go bankrupt before they backdown. That's why they got a shit rating of BBB and have an interest rate of 3.375% on their bond. BUT we KNOW there are lots of other major players. The post I saw last night got me thinking about it because of the mention of our friendly market maker, Jane Street Capital, who I had not heard of before.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER - there may have been a reason the link I mentioned above got removed. Perhaps it was inaccurate DD about Jane's potentially massive short position in GME? It seemed credible and well cited to me though. Anyways, back to the tea..</p>
<p>Tl;dr on Auntie Jane - they manage 17 trillion in capital (wiki link) and trade an average of 21 billion in equities A DAY. These guys are HUGE compared to Shitadel's measily ($35 billion in capital). That being said, I believe their position was not quite as large. Anyways, these guys are interesting because they manage a TON of ETFs. Because of this, the SEC views them as an essential component to market growth and so they are generally under less scrutiny (not that the SEC does shit anyways...). Interestingly, this has allowed them to make a fuck ton of money with aggressive shorting and naked shorting.</p>
<p>Who cares? I've never heard about these guys and what does any of this have to do with the bond market?</p>
<p>While...a failure of the banks who sell bonds to "Zombie companies" would have a MUCH bigger impact on the economy and market than a failure of Citadel and uncle Melvin. Right now there is a MASSIVE bubble in the US Bond market. ***CORPORATE DEBT IS CURRENTLY ABOUT 10.5 TRILLION***</p>
<p>We know Citadel has gone all in and they're going to go bankrupt and default on their $600 million bond. If these other HFs and Market Makers like Jane Street Capital dig themselves in a hole that is too big to climb out --- they too will apply for a bond. And they'll probably get one! I mean WHO THE FUCK WOULD GIVE $600 MILLION TO KENNY G?? If they gave it to him they'll gave it to anyone. Just like in 2008, these shitty ass bonds have to get paid for eventually right? If these institutions follow Citadel's path and decide not to back out of their position they too will be applying for some of these shitbag bonds. Unfortunately, interest rates on these god damn bonds have been low for so long and there are thousands of these "Zombie companies" that will likely default on them (not GME tho baby GME about to go BRRRRRRRRR).</p>
<p>Thus, their is a massive bubble in the bond market and if more and more institutions that have a massive short position on GME don't back down -- they will follow Citadel's suit and go get dat bond moneyy. If other institutions pursue these bonds that is their signal that they will bankrupt themselves before losing on GME. It could also be the straw that breaks the camels back as it relates to the massive bubble in the bond market.</p>
<p>Finally, a smooth brained ape might ask: what happens to GME in all this? FUCKING MOON BABY. $GME go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.</p>

<p>tl;dr - there is a massive corporate bond bubble in the US. Citadel will go bankrupt and default on their shitty BBB rated $600m bond. If other major players with short positions apply for bonds we know they plan to go bankrupt before losing on their GME short position. Multiple institutions defaulting on bonds could break open the US corporate debt bubble causing collapse of the market. GME STILL GO BRRRRRRRR.</p>

<p>EDIT 1: Unfortunately cannot change the title. Apes with a lot more ridges than myself are making great points that the stock market is not representative of the economy. Please consider that if this theory lends any credibility it may just further explain how the market could crash without necessarily meaning the economy will tank. If anyone wants to learn more about the distinction consider replying to u/market-unmaker and u/RealPropRandy comments as I am guessing they know a hell of a lot more about this then me.</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>u/jxys1723 asked how do we know their BBB-rated bond is indeed BBB?

<p>BBB is not the worst of all ratings by any means but per Fidelity's assessment (link above) they consider it to have one of the lowest investment grades.</p>
<p>Edit 3:</p>
<p>Thx to u/glitterydick important clarification that Citadels bonds are actually BBB- and not BBB. This rating IS literally the worst investment-grade bond rating possible.</p>

<p>Interesting comment from u/Adventurous_Policy46</p>
<p>His/her words: "I think this may only be half the story. I really don’t know much about securitisation and am very smooth brained. However, I did a bit of digging to try link up some of the dots that didn’t quite make sense to me and there are some interesting pointers.</p>
<p>I suspect Citadel Securities has been wrapping up short positions as CLOs (Collateral Loan Obligations). Check their financial statement from 2019 on the Sec website. It specifically refers to shorting and rehypotocation. Basically we’re talking about the same mechanism like CDOs in the financial crisis of 2008 but here they are using short positions. These CLOs are then sold onto the big investment banks.</p>
<p>Interestingly they even refer to finite gain and “infinite loss” in the Market Risk section.</p>
<p>If you do some searching on CLOs and citadel you will find several connections. Here is even an article that refers to a CLO purchase by MS:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globalcapital.com/article/k6bqlh982368/morgan-stanley-arranges-citadel-clo">https://www.globalcapital.com/article/k6bqlh982368/morgan-stanley-arranges-citadel-clo</a></p>
<p>Would be great for someone with more wrinkles to dive into this part of the whole story. Just feels like an onion with many layers. It also reminds me of the scene from the Big Short where they are in the casino and people bet on the bet of someone’s bet.</p>
<p>If this is the case and GME goes nuts, these CLOs will be junk or worse, meaning they have to be written off as far as I understand.</p>
<p>Not financial advise at all. Just did some smooth brained research and may not make sense so take it with a pinch of salt."</p>
<p>My thoughts: This comment is really interesting to me and also reminds me of The Big Short. Specifically, in a way that relates to how the institutions that are short haven't bled out. If you recall in The Big Short, Steve Carrell's character (Mark Baum in movie, Steve Eisman IRL) HF was a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. Ryan Gosling's character, the Investment banker from Deutsche bank presents Baum with the research that they should short the housing market. Why doesn't Gosling do it himself? Deutsche bank won't let him touch that. Shorting the housing market = bad optics. Baum's firm probably existed as a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley because they can then get away with investments that are highly profitable, and that a bank wants to get in on but can't do it directly because of the bad optics.  u/Adventurous_Policy46 theory makes me think back to that relationship between the HFs and banks. Why haven't the HFs and market makers bled out yet? Man, it's hard for me to believe this whole thing doesn't go deeper than we know in some way, shape, or form. Feel like this is all more interconnected and incestuous than we realize. Or I'm just a conspiracy theorist at this point who the fuck knows. Would be great if someone with more wrinkles than us could delve into the CLO aspect.</p>
