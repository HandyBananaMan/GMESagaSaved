As stated in my first DD:

The most important takeaway from the updated 3/26 Bloomberg terminal was who owned the calls and puts:

Notice how the entire call and put option spread is owned by net short positions? ALL OPTIONS ARE ENEMIES. This is the game the shorts have now chosen to play, and our long whales are inflicting max pain with lower price point closings. STOP PUSHING THE GAMMA SQUEEZE (we don’t need it), stop buying options (you are wasting your money if our long whales thought options were profitable they would be purchasing them), STOP SETTING EXPECTATIONS AND DATES. Let our kongs do their work and send these short bear fucks into a liquidity black hole. Be patient apes our time is coming.

EMBRACE THE GRIND. BUY THE DIP AND HODL.
