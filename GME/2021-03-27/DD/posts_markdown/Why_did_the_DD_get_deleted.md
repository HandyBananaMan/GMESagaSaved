Thought this was solid, why did it get deleted?

>TLDR down below. Some emojis to keep the stupids happy. 
>
>Let me tell you how I discovered this information, so you know I'm not just pulling it out of my crack, I'll start with some speculation about Jane Street before we get into the big numbers and big players. I'm serious guys, dark souls bosses have nothing on what's coming up; 
>
>**Dis gon be gud**
>
>So, I was looking into my portfolio, with sadness and tears. My biggest investments aside from GME, are OTC stocks that have done nothing but tank over the last few weeks, and I dunno why. A noteable one, Alpine4, had huge amounts of solid DD and praise on Reddit at the start of the year. It's waiting for a NASDAQ uplist, is making acquisitions all over the place yet the price has tanked by nearly 60%.
>
>So, seeing as stocks only go up, I decided to look around for a possible answer as to why OTC is taking a huge hit. It seems the cause, is Jane Street Capital and it could tie in directly with GME.
>
>Lets look at Jane Street first, before we go onto dirty Uncle Melvin and the others.
>
># Jane Street Capital
>
>This company is a fucking weird one. It seems to have kinda come out of nowhere and is suddenly worth a metric shitonne of money. They specialise in ETF's (and if there's one word that goes well with ETF's at the moment, it's gotta be "fuckery")
>
>Anyway, they are a fucking GOLIATH. Their assets under managment is $200 billion, compared to Citadels pathetic $35 bil. They trade trillions of dollars (about 14 trillion in 2020) of shit each year. 
>
>They are a company which seems to thrive off instability and chaos in the market, and that's how they make their money.
>
>Someone on Twitter did some research and found out that on 22nd Feb, Jane St suddenly appeared on 36 of the highest volume OTC stocks. And from this date onwards, it started fucking them hard with shorting. From this date onwards it literally started railing OTC stocks into the ground, turning $8 stocks into nearly fucking pennystocks.
>
>What's unique about this date?
>
>Well, on this date GME was at $44.97.... And on the following day, GME started it's rise. On the 23rd it was it $91, the next day was triple digits and we've not left that area since.
>
>So, maybe it's just a coincidence that a huge Wall Street market maker started fucking the price out of dozens of OTC stocks that are lesser regulated and can be traded with far less scrutiny through darkpools and can be pounded into the ground on the same date that GME rises again.  
>
>Well yeah, I mean, OTC can be volatile, nobody gives a shit about OTC stocks crashing, it probably is a coincid... **WHAT DO YOU MEAN JANE STREET ARE INTO GME ASWELL?!**
>
>Yep, guess what, Jane Street are also fairly deep into GME. 
>
>Guess when they disclosed their updated GME positions? **17th Feb**, just a handful of days before they went at OTC without lube and GME rose. 
>
>They currently own a pretty pathetic 207,876 shares, worth just under 4 million $. They had increased their shares by just 12,000.
>
>However, they went deep nutz on calls and puts. They increased puts by 6% to 1 million and calls by **56%** to 1.6 million.
>
>The value of their puts is $20mil and the calls is $29mil. 
>
>Now, what I cannot understand, is why a huge fund needs to bother shorting the shit out of 5 dollar stocks on the OTC to try and gain some extra cash. I mean, cash is cash, I get that, but as a general rule, institutions don't bother with OTC stuff. They generally only trade NYSE and NASDAQ items, so why have they suddenly got a huge hardon for 36 high volume OTC companies and began shorting the fuck out of them?
>
>The only real theory here, is that they are manipulating (through naked shorting done on the OTC because nobody cares) OTC stocks, firstly for extra cash and secondly to fuck over retail that hold them. Crucially though, they have increased their call and put positions in GME. 
>
>*However*, why would you buy calls and puts at the same time? I mean, when you guys are bashing buttons on Robinhood, you buy one or the other right? You don't go and buy call options, put options, AND the stock, right? Of course not, you're a retail idiot. We bet on it going up and down. That's what we do, we bet one way or the other.
>
>Hedgies like to bet both ways and make sure they can get maximum tendies.
>
>Let me quote some internet for you;
>
>*The synthetic short stock options strategy consists of simultaneously selling a call option and buying the same number of put options at the same strike price.*
>
>*Both options must be in the same expiration cycle. As the strategy's name suggests, a synthetic short stock position replicates shorting 100 shares of stock.*
>
>**To be profitable when trading synthetic short stock positions, the stock price must decrease from the point of entry.**
>
># Looks like we found some shorting wankers, boys & girls
>
>Don't worry about the bones of synthetic shorting, just accept that it's a way of shorting the stock through options and when the price drops they win, when the price rises, they lose. 
>
>These Jane Street pricks are synthetic shorting GME to profit off a downward drop in price. Secondly, they are manipulating OTC stocks to fuck retail over and to gain even more dirty greedy money.
>
>The thing to remember here, Jane Street have *deep fuckin pockets*.
>
>Now, we don't know how much this is hurting them, but we can be assured that any price of GME above what it was on Feb 22nd is causing them a financial bleed.
>
># **But if they are doing illegal shit on OTC, they'll be investigated right?**
>
>Well, no. During the 2020 Covid-19 Market Crash (which lasted about 3 months), Jane Street (due to its immense involvement with bond based ETF's) was considered as a driving factor for keeping the market liquidity at a good level and reducing the damage done to the overall market. And if the government and the SEC like something more than ignoring illegal shit, it's ignoring illegal shit done by people who prevented huge fucking headaches during a pandemic. 
>
>The thing is, this is just one other big fat hedgie getting in the GME game. There are dozens of these pricks at it.
>
>I've also found that learning about Jane Street is hard. They don't give much away, they are quiet, there's not a huge amount of public info about them and they are very grey. Seriously, they are one of the biggest MM's and their wikipedia entry is like, 15 lines long. 
>
>Anyway, let's get onto something we understand a bit more;
>
># Uncle Melvin Time!
>
>Ahh yes, good old nasty uncle melvin. He was burnt by the GME squeeze of January, he had to get Papa Citadel to bail him out because he overcooked his tendies and set fire to the whole fucking kitchen.
>
>So, guess what Papa Melvin declared in February?? 
>
># He dun fukin do it agen
>
>That's right kids, a 13f filing here;
>https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821000248/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml
>
>Shows that the current Melvin position on GME is still.... *drumroll*
>
># 6 million puts with a street value of one hundred and thirteen million and forty thousand dollars. LOL. 
>
>So homebois, after nearly getting totally destroyed, Uncle Melvin decided he still wanted in on the GME train and is still in possession of $113,040,000 worth of puts, which were declared to the SEC on 16th Feb 2021. Melvin literally SEC declared 6 million puts just nine days before GME went back into triple digits. 
>
>(hold onto this whole 13f form thought for the time being though)
>
>*Press F to pay respects*
>
>Ironically, if we're just talking about the value of any investment (regardless as to whether its a put, call, share or is in profit or losing), that puts Melvin 3rd in line for the most valuable interest in GME, just behind Blackrock and Papa Cohen. 
>
># SIG Has just entered the chat
>
>Here's a screengrab of some of the current institutional investors in GME;
>![GME Investors](https://i.imgur.com/nh8yW8A.png)
>
>So, SIG is Susquehanna International Group. 
>
>And they just disclosed in a 13f that dropped **today** their position. 
>
>Note; Beware before you open this, its fucking huge. And it details EVERY position they have, and they have thousands. If you don't open it, i'm gonna tell you what it says right now:

>Just like Jane Street earlier, these motherfuckers have loaded up on puts and calls;
>
>**1.8 million calls, increase of 1.1 million. Street value - $34.7mil**
>
>
>**4.8 million puts, increase of 2 million. Street value - $91 mil**
>
>IMHO, Sig have loaded up with the fucking Manhattan Project of synthetic short positions and remember what happens if stonk goes up right? They goofed.
>
># This isn't fair, why is everyone loading up on shorts? Where's the whales at?
>
>Well, don't despair. 
>
>I did some DD weeks ago about how I think Vanguard are our biggest friendly whale. They are still in with 5.1 million shares with only a tiny decrease of about 100,000. Senvest are still in for 5 million and their latest report showed an increase of 1 million. Of course we have Papa Cohen who is solid as a fucking rock, plus Morgan Stanley, Maverick Capital and Hestia, who have all increased positions (Maverick and Morgan by 2+ millie shares)
>
>As far as I can see, the teams stack up like this;
>
>**Blue Team, Captain - Ryan Cohen**
>
>* Retail
>
>* Vanguard
>
>* Morgan Stanley
>
>* Blackrock
>
>* Maverick Capital
>
>* Senvest
>
>* State Street
>
>* D.E Shaw
>
>**Red Team, Cpatain - Ken Griffin**
>
>* Melvin
>
>* SIG
>
>* UBS Group (dont underestimate these fucks btw, I didn't cover them here but they are pretty big)
>
>* Group One Trading (same with these motherfuckers)
>
>* Jane Street Capital
>
>* Citadel
>
>* Citibank (A huge player but their position is only at 30 mil)
>
>* Wolverine Trading
>
>* Maplelane Capital

>If this is still how it sits, and these are the teams, you

And apparently I missed a part 

>I see it's cut before quite important part, so:
>
>&#x200B;
>
>If this is still how it sits, and these are the teams, you can see why GME is such a huge fight. I imagine it like those giant fucking Walrus' you see on the beach on a nature documentary. They literally just throw themselves at each other with 4 tonnes of blubber until one of them gets bored and fucks off. That's what these bois are doing.
>
>That being said, I'd say the retail team is pretty fucking strong but don't underestimate the shorts. This is not just shitty Ken Griffin and his rag-tag cowboy outfit that is Citadel. That being said, if one of these big boys on the short side pulls the plug, it could trigger something half decent. For the time being though, it appears they are still very much dedicated to it.
>
>I'd say retail are slightly winning, but there's a lot of time still on the clock before the final whistle goes.
>
>**The most important part of the DD**
>
>Yeah, fuck all that shit above.
>
>Let me leave you with this, from Investopedia;
>
>**The SEC itself has acknowledged that 13F filings are not necessarily reliable because no one at the SEC analyzes the content for accuracy and completeness. After all, the infamous fraudster Bernard Madoff dutifully filed 13F forms every quarter.**
>
>Seriously. Nobody at the SEC even fucking checks 13f's. It boggles my mind that congress aren't asking for 13f reform, and instead are more occupied with getting boomers to ask Keith Gill whether he likes the fucking stock or not. This America, sums up totally what is wrong with your financial system.
>
>As a result, the figures I've quoted above for institution ownership can be wrong. It's also why you don't blindly trust a Bloomberg Terminal.
>
>Wall Street is all smoke and mirrors. There's no honesty and pretty much everything is guesswork. Only those playing the game know the full extent of what is going on, and even then, you can imagine that the peeps at Vanguard are guessing what the guys at SIG are doing and vice versa.
>
>if we cannot have a system the can inform us on a reliable level, who actually just owns what, then you have no chance of calculating OTC trades, darkpools trades, short interest, full ownership, short positions and all the other shit that makes GME roll at the moment.
>
>That being said, you can pretty much gurantee the likes of Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, Cohen etc are talking to each other about Citadel and co. It's not against the law for a trader at Blackrock to phone a guy at Vanguard and drop him some info or ask questions about Melvin. As the old saying goes, an enemy of my enemy is my friend. They might be in the business of tricking each other about other investments, but they'd be stupid not to share thoughts and information when it comes to GME. You can also gurantee that the GME board will have some knowledge of what their investors are saying, which is why I'm confident they are so bullish. Now, they could be full of bullshit but I seriously doubt that.
>
>Tbh, it wouldn't even surprise me if DFV's financial advisors have some sort of a line into this. I mean, based on my calculations, he's the 102nd biggest investor in GME out of a total of 324. It does make him fairly insignificant, but he does have a very solid and direct link to literally every retail holder, and combined, I personally believe retail is in the top 5 holders of GME.
>
>Anyway, back to my rant about the SEC;
>
>"You must legally fill out this 13f document to disclose what you are doing, but nobody will check it, you can file it 45 days later than the actual actions you report on, and nobody will even bother to see if it's full of lies or not".
>
>Fucking hell.
>
>**TL:DR** \- Melvin, Citadel and others are still balls deep in this. Jane Street capital are fucking OTC stocks to get more money, probably to fuck retail over and to have more money to throw at GME. The manipulation of OTC is probably not legal but will never get proven or challenged.
>
>The retail have some big friendly whales still on board. Dont trust bloomberg terminals. I got the SIG info from today quicker online than is what is showing on a BB. Imho, they are a waste of money.
>
>This game stacks up like a dark souls boss. The shorts have some serious power still on their team but whales and bulls have some real solid ground and the current price movement makes it even stronger. It's not great, I wanted over $200 today, but its totally not terrible.
>
>The SEC doesn't even read 13f forms (seriously, what the fuck). The battle is still on a bit of a knife edge but the current price gives retail a fairly big edge. Retail have some huge guns on its side and GME and Cohen/DFV being openly bullish as fuck is a good thing.
