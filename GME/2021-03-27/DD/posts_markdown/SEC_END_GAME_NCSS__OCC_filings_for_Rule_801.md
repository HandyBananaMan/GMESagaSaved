We are beginning to see some great DD being posted about the SEC Rule changes.  I have taken the time to read these rule changes (i'm stuck on call this Saturday so might as well type up some fresh DD) to the links I am posting below in regards to Rule 801.  Now I am no Lawyer, nor some Technical Analysis master ( looking at you u/WardenElite ).  I am but a humble Ape who enjoys Video games and has held onto my GME Bananas since January (love the dips btw if your reading this Uncle Melvin).  This is by NO MEANS financial advice.  I Free base crayons and have an addiction to loss porn.

I will keep this as simple as possible as reading compression in this group is equivalent to Bulgaria post Ottoman rule (Look at you Vlad).

**Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)**

*(Release No. 34-91184; File No. SR-OCC-2021-801)*

**Nation Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)**

*(Release No. 34-91347; File No. SR-NSCC-2021-801)*

[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2021/34-91347.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2021/34-91347.pdf)

As you can **CLEARLY** see these are both advanced notices.  (OCC is dated 2.10.21) (NCSS is dated 3.5.21)

Now you may be thinking. "*Ok fellow shit slinger. When can they Implement such rule changes*?"

That would be whenever they wanted within 60 days (even if some parties request an additional 60 days).  This is taken VERBATIM from BOTH notices:

&#x200B;

**OCC's**

*“The proposed change may be implemented if the Commission does not object to the proposed change within 60 days of the later of (i) the date the proposed change was filed with the Commission or (ii) the date any additional information requested by the Commission is received. OCC shall not implement the proposed change if the Commission has any objection to the proposed change”*

**NSCC's**

*"The proposed change may be implemented if the Commission does not object to the proposed change within 60 days of the later of (i) the date that the proposed change was filed with the Commission or (ii) the date that any additional information requested by the Commission is received. The clearing agency shall not implement the proposed change if the Commission has any objection to the proposed change."*

&#x200B;

If you actually read both forms from the OCC & the NSCC. The SEC may implement these rule changes **NOW**.

So what's stopping them from sending Shitadel to the soup line?

My Opinion is they are waiting until after 3/31 for the COVID relief Margin the Big Banks have been getting via the government to end (i.e  They need to make sure they have the liquidity to cover their securities).  I am also unsure if the DTCC **(#EDIT#: NSCC is a Subsidiary of the DTCC)** has proposed and submitted their advanced notice to rule 801 (If you have it please send me a PM to edit this DD).

&#x200B;

**TL:DR**

**The OCC & the NSCC are already at the table.  We may just be waiting for the DTCC.  The SEC is closing in on Shitadel,  Jane Street, Uncle Melvin, "Sus"quehanna and any other clown still with "Skin-in-the-Game" in regards to GME. To hell with the price of GME now.  The new SLD rules will cripple the Shorters ability to combat the upward buy pressure let alone outright bankrupt them.  They (the NSCC) can Liquidate up to 110% of their members due to their position.**

&#x200B;

**EDIT to TLDR:**

**As** u/Toni_KT **points out.  The NSCC is a subsidiary to the DTCC.  So it appears all the players are at the table and are officially on the Federal Registrar as of 3.24.21.  I still believe we are waiting for the beginning of April to see major moves.**

**As always HODL.  If the Rocket doesn't ignite next week that's ok.  GME has deep long term value and I REALLY like the Stock.**

&#x200B;

If I am mistaken on anything. Or I am misinterpreting any of this.  Please read it and point out where I am incorrect.  I will review, edit and respond to the best of my ability.

EDIT: u/rensole this is getting downvoted into infinity lolz

Edit 2: I clearly suck at acronyms. Can't fix the header or meme. Should be *NSCC*
