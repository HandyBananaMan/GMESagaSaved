**Disclaimer:** *This entire post reflects my personal opinion and is in no way financial advice. And for full transparency I also want you to know that I'm holding shares in GME and would financially benefit from any increase in price.*

Let me start this by saying that I am convinced that we need to stop asking or providing dates for the potential short squeeze (made that mistake myself) and also stop *overhyping* things like SSR.Every post that is about Citadel going under or predicting a specific date does NOT help anyone but just creates false expectations.

This post here aims to provide you with price level predictions that stood the test of time and that I myself confirmed multiple times on GME as well.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT take any dates shown/predicted in graphs as given. The only thing predicted here are price levels and even those only reflect my personal opinion and are in no way financial advice. Dates shown on the charts for future price levels are completely irrelevant.**

Since most of you likely won't read the entire post - although you should - I'm going to start with where GME is going and only provide a brief introduction to Elliott Wave theory.

In addition to that, you might want to check out:

# How can you predict where GME is going?

As mentioned in my previous posts, I'm relying on Elliott Wave Theory to predict market movements.I'm not going to example all the details here, but if you are really curious you can:

* Read "Elliott Wave Principle" for free online at [https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle) or order a physical copy for $29 at [https://www.elliottwave.com/Book/Elliott-Wave-Principle](https://www.elliottwave.com/Book/Elliott-Wave-Principle)
* Read my previous posts [Why $10,000 per share is just a stop along the way...](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6cebh/why_10000_per_share_is_just_a_stop_along_the_way/) and [Elliott Waves & GME 🚀 Part #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md4emt/elliott_waves_gme_part_2/)
* Watch the recording of yesterday's live stream [Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec)

**However, there are a few basics you should understand:**

1. The market moves in waves.
2. On the biggest degree/scale we are always looking at something called an "Impulse", a wave that splits into 5 subwaves (see 1-2-3-4-5 on all screenshots).
3. Each Impulse is followed by a corrective pattern (there are a few of those, labeled A-B-C or similar).
4. Each wave by itself is part of a bigger wave and contains smaller waves. Explained very well on this [one-page cheat sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVTnzj67DOATFyisgIHTb_YfEN4CrkSb/view). In fact, that one piece of paper, combined with basic understanding (reading and understanding chapter #1 of the book) is likely enough to allow you to work with Elliott Waves yourself
5. Out of wave #1, #3, and #5, wave #3 can NEVER be the shortest.

To illustrate that, take a look at the GME monthly chart below:

![GME Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wwuv3hsz0kp61.png?width=1847&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa21d4d341a9fa8124d9a53b40c36f41b1d67097)

**Important:** The labeling in this chart violates two rules of the Elliott Wave Principle.

1. *Orange Wave II is below 0. This is in my opinion acceptable because we are looking at the chart since IPO*
2. *Orange Wave IV retraces below I. This is ok because Elliott Wave rules can't be fully enforced when the market isn't "free" (buying restrictions causing a bigger drop).*

Besides that, what you can see is:

* In Orange the biggest Impulse wave we are currently in, showing that we are currently in Wave V of that impulse.
* Once we finish this Wave V it will become Wave I (Green) of another Impulse of a bigger degree *(read the book, all of that is covered in chapter 1 in more detail).*
* Wave I (orange) contains another Impulse (1-2-3-4-5 in blue).
* Wave II and IV are corrective waves and we could label the corrective patterns in them. (Wave IV would require us to look at a lower timeframe to label its "subwaves" properly).

**What you should remember here is that we are currently in Wave V of an Impulse and that wave goes ⬆️.**

*Also, as you can see our orange wave V ends around $562 to $747, but this is NOT the squeeze but simply will turn this Orange wave into Wave I of another Impulse of a bigger degree. And this is not the final prediction for that wave either because as we map out waves of lower degree we'll get "more accurate" predictions.*

# How accurate are Elliott Waves?

I don't know, you tell me... *(sorry, getting annoyed by this question).* But let's take a look at some of the predictions I shared previously.

![Prediction \(Orange Range\)](https://preview.redd.it/5xcj9gg7yjp61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d0a8dcca4202c52e7b1b5019b3842f02377446)

Followed by me predicting (after we hit that area) that we'll see a drop to $137-$207 in the comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/).

![Reality](https://preview.redd.it/omwwn5kbyjp61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b2ea998397edc7bb1bb24e89ea94ee3f784938c)

In fact, Elliott Waves are that accurate that I was willing to do a live stream yesterday and predict the entire trading session in real-time at  [Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec)

I could share a few more examples, but I'd assume that I got your attention now.

*Here I have to say that not all my predictions during the live mapping were accurate but not because Elliott Wave principles were wrong. In all cases, where my predictions were wrong I jumped the gun and labeled the chart too early with a wrong pattern, and only after a few additional candles corrected the mistake.However, if you want to know for sure and take the time to watch the recording of that stream you'll see just how on spot the predictions are/were when I labeled them right.* ***And we are not talking about labeling the past, but labeling a few existing candles to predict where the next candles are going to be.***

# Where GME is going?

I know most of you probably already forgot but here is the monthly chart of GME again with some extra information.

![Elliott Wave Projection for GME](https://preview.redd.it/0ev2ban23kp61.png?width=1741&format=png&auto=webp&s=df1397e1817648db77417e5ffab93033ef940442)

**Don't get too excited yet, because that prediction assumes that our wave V (orange) will be exactly in the predicted area and all following waves (green) will also hit the projected areas precisely.**

In reality, those levels will move a bit as we work out the wave patterns on a lower degree and as things play out.

Everyone that watched my live stream yesterday [Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec) knows what I'm talking about, but if you haven't the important points are:

1. Elliott Waves are highly accurate but here and there the price doesn't reach the predicted range or moves further.
2. When that happens we have to move the label for that wave which also changes the predicted price area for the following wave.
3. As a result, the price areas shown in the green waves are going to change "a lot" but we'll get more accurate predictions as we go (as more candles developed on lower timeframes and allow us to map out the waves of lower degree)

# Let's take a closer look...

Remember, each wave contains waves of a smaller degree, and thanks to our [one-page cheat sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVTnzj67DOATFyisgIHTb_YfEN4CrkSb/view) we also know which "subwaves" to expect and with what frequency to expect them.

According to the cheat sheet wave #5 of an Impulse consists of another Impulse 93% of the time or an ending diagonal 7% of the time. (Both of those patterns are labeled 1-2-3-4-5).

![Reading the Cheat Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/snjio09z4kp61.png?width=260&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aabcccff5821f533044c3831b05a36f0acdee69)

**Summary of what we know based on our monthly chart:**

* we are currently in Wave #5 of an Impulse
* wave #5 by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse or Ending Diagonal
* wave #5 starts at the low of $38.50 we had on the 19th of February

![Subwaves of Wave #5 mapped on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/18o7e4u08kp61.png?width=1829&format=png&auto=webp&s=661169e21f28b25fdf2d556201130880351ec324)

As you can see above, I've mapped out the subwave of wave #5 on the hourly chart and if you read my previous posts [Why $10,000 per share is just a stop along the way...](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6cebh/why_10000_per_share_is_just_a_stop_along_the_way/) and [Elliott Waves & GME 🚀 Part #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md4emt/elliott_waves_gme_part_2/) you'll notice that I did much of that before it happened.

Based on this (in red) we are currently in wave #3 (which is going ⬆️ ) and, as we learned earlier, this wave can never be the shortest.

**IMPORTANT REMINDER:** While the projected area for that wave #3 isn't even visible on the screen this does NOT mean that we'll shoot up there in a day because every wave consists of waves of smaller degrees.

To illustrate that better take a look at...

![GME hourly chart. Pay attention to the highlighted area.](https://preview.redd.it/ru58kmjv8kp61.png?width=1849&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f902eb80212a26a8c50ae47bce7b056f384b4d6)

![GME 5-min chart. The highlighted area shows the waves within the red area highlighted in the hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/0xdh89619kp61.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53a1468933e2882054a2a922f7d586073e22d61)

*And just as a reminder, in the live yesterday, that you can watch by clicking on* [*Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec) *I mapped out all the waves you see starting from {v} (orange) to the price at market close in real-time.*

# When/How do you know we reached the top and where/when are you going to sell?

I will use Elliott Waves and sell once I can confirm the corrective pattern that's following after wave #5 (of the biggest degree) which will be our squeeze. In other words, I'll do what I did during [yesterday's live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec) with the A-B-C (green) that connects I and II (blue) and will likely be able to sell between the A and B (green).

*(I know the recording is long, but it's weekend, the markets are closed, and watching (parts of) it might actually teach you something.)*

# Where does all of that leave us? Where are we going? When are we going there?

**TL;DR** According to Elliott Wave Theory, that stood the test of time and that I used myself to predict multiple movements in GME with incredibly high accuracy we are going up. With each new candle, the predicted price areas for our 🌚 become more accurate.

There are no predicted dates for that 🚀 launch, but that doesn't matter because based on current predictions I still believe that [$10,000 per share is just a stop along the way](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6cebh/why_10000_per_share_is_just_a_stop_along_the_way/), and if it takes a year to get there it's still likely the best investments I will have made in my entire life.

**Patience is key, because...**

>"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."*- Warren Buffett.*

And while I read most of the other DD posts I trust Elliott Waves enough to ignore the rest and calmly watch $100 and more drops because I expected them to come in advance and I know that the drops are just wave #2 and #4 of bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse waves that take us further up.

**Do NOT try to trade the waves, because here and there the price doesn't fully reach a predicted area, and you might end up missing up on big upwards movements.**

**IMPORTANT:** *The only situation where Elliott Waves don't apply or not all rules can be enforced would be if trading got restricted in some way or prices get "fixed" by the government. Outside of that Elliott Waves stood the test of time and also apply to previous squeezes in other stocks.*

***Obviously, as stated, all of this is just my personal opinion, and you should do what you feel is right.***

# Edit #1: Does that also apply considering all the manipulation that's going on with GME?

As stated at the end of chapter #1 of "Elliott Wave Principle" (see [https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle))

>All rules and guidelines of the Wave Principle fundamentally apply to actual market mood, not its recording *per se* or lack thereof. Its clear manifestation requires free market pricing. When prices are fixed by government edict, such as those for gold and silver for half of the twentieth century, waves restricted by the edict are not allowed to register. When the available price record differs from what might have existed in a free market, rules and guidelines must be considered in that light. In the long run, of course, markets always win out over edicts, and edict enforcement is only possible if the mood of the market allows it. All rules and guidelines presented in this book presume that your price record is accurate.

So, unless there are buying/selling restrictions or fixed prices set by the government Elliott Waves should apply just fine.

**Edit #2:** Since multiple people asked I've decided to live stream at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsc1gAr0t2ME4nzu4PCAnow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsc1gAr0t2ME4nzu4PCAnow) daily (Mo - Fr) for the foreseeable future (unless I have appointments that force/require me to leave our apartment) and moved my regular setup into our small "studio". However, I won't comment as actively as I did during Friday's session but will stream one of my screens with my current predictions, comment/update on it every probably 30 minutes, and in between do what I'd usually do on my other screens.  
This should serve multiple purposes:

1. People that doubt the accuracy or still somehow think I label the past and nothing gets predicted can check in real-time how the waves develop and how much in advance certain levels/movements are predicted, and maybe watch live how my entire predictions turn out to be wrong.
2. Everyone that already is an Elliott Wave fanboy will get more insights and maybe some of you know more than I do (I'm by far no Elliott Wave Theory "guru") and can point out mistakes I may make along the way.
3. If/when we get to the squeeze I'll likely be live as well and people may use the information provided to determine their "exit strategy" or not, since I'm just sharing my opinion.
4. While my DD posts so far mention certain resources, and, as explained in [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecpjv/if\_you\_want\_to\_know\_where\_gme\_is\_going\_read\_this/gsk6ezi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecpjv/if_you_want_to_know_where_gme_is_going_read_this/gsk6ezi/) I don't benefit in any way if you read/buy the book or sign up at WaveBasis, it should be obvious, that I benefit eventually from YouTube if those live streams or videos gain me additional subscribers and watchtime and as a result, my channel is able to join the YouTube Partner Program. In any case, I think we all agree that the potential profits of my GME investment - assuming my predictions are right - far surpass any potential financial gain I might get on YouTube.

In any case, you make of that what you want, and if you want to see more real-time charting using Elliott Waves feel free to tune in to any of the upcoming lives.
