#Who is worth what?
First, I want you to open up notepad or grab a sheet a paper and rank the following companies from highest to lowest market cap:

* Facebook
* Walmart
* Home Depot
* Pfizer 
* Morgan Stanley 
* Adobe
* Shell 
* Berkshire Hathaway 

Next, check out the results below (no cheating please):

How did you do? Any surprises? Or were you 100% correct (nice one tryhard)? Comment below. 

#Hurr durr what is market cap?
The entire point of this thread is give you a brief look into market capitalization commonly known as market cap. Market cap can be calculated by taking the price of a stock and multiplying it by the shares outstanding. For example, company ABC has 30 million shares and the stock price is $20. The market cap of company ABC would be $600 million. Meanwhile company XYZ has 10 million shares and the stock price $50. The market cap of company XYZ would be $500 million. Notice how company ABC's stock price is lower than company XYZ's YET company ABC has a greater market cap. What does that mean? Well it means company ABC has a greater value on the market AKA the price assets fetch on the marketplace.   

#Wait debt is a good thing for businesses? 
Market cap is a great tool to quickly compare the sizes of different companies... and that's about it. When you wanna go more in depth regarding capital or debt, then you look at the enterprise value. Or the fundamentals. Or the balance sheets. Funny thing, while we are discussing debt, I noticed that a lot of shills have been pointing out GameStop's debt to try and spread FUD to the new guys. Debt is COMPLETELY NORMAL when dealing with businesses. It's not like credit card debt for people like us. In business, debt is a cheap way to finance operations. Interest on debt is tax deductible and the premium you pay on acquiring debt is less than what you would pay on the same amount of equity. In other words, it's a better investment. Apple, the company with the largest market cap in the world, finished its most recent quarter with almost ~$200 billion in cash and ~$100 billion in debt. Why not just pay off the debt? Well, to put it simply, it would cost them more. See, the experts are the "experts" because they took time to acquire knowledge. They aren't necessarily "smarter" but they can bullshit you easier when they know you don't know what's going on. So they throw around these terms like bRiCk aNd MoRTaR and DeBt to make things sound worse than they really are. 

#Muh brick and mortar myth
Brick and mortar is a term used to refer to traditional businesses that sell its products or services face to face. Walmart is considered brick and mortar though they sell some stuff online.  Home Depot sells both brick and mortar and is considered brick and mortar though they sell stuff online as well. Look at where both companies are in the list (17 and 24, respectively). GameStop? Yah same thing but they also sell stuff online as well and have been for a while YET the media constantly labels them as bRiCk aNd MoRtAr. There's nothing wrong with brick and mortar as long as there's demand for it.  Look at Saudi Aramco. #2 most valuable on the list. They refine and sell oil and gas. Since people buy gas from a gas station, it's a bRiCk aNd MoRtAr business with a nearly 2 trillion market cap. So much for that stupid label.  A business is a business whether it's face to face or online though GameStop is now both. Demand matters most. 
 

#One moment, can a company jump onto the top 10 or fall the fuck off in a instant?  
Yes Tesla went from $100 billion in 2019 to $500 billion market cap in 2020. Up 700%. Also being shorted to hell. Did you know that market cap changes each passing second? Even during the after hours of normal trading. All those answers you got from the URL above could be entirely different next week. Who knows? Since the stock price fluctuates and market cap = stock price x shares outstanding, we quickly realize that market cap moves up or down with stock price. How do we get stock price? From good old supply and demand, mostly just demand - YOU GUYS. Whenever we have HIGH supply and LOW demand, we get those bargain bin shovelware games you won't touch even for a dollar. Whenever we have LOW supply and HIGH demand, we get a scalper's market PS5 going for $1500 on eBay. But hold on a second, the MSRP says $400 or $500, there's no way it can sell for $1500. Oh yes it can. With enough demand, you'll find someone willing to pay that price simply due to value or the belief of its worth or because they need it. Now is it actually worth that much when you compare it purely from a technological standpoint to a gaming PC? No. You're getting less bang for your buck. But some people simply don't care. They want it and you have it. That's capitalism baby for better or worse. 

#b-b-b-but a car can't be worth $70 million dollars

Another example if you still aren't getting it. Think of the most expensive car in the world today. Is it every ape's lambo dream car? Is it the Bugatti Chiron? Or the Koenigsegg Agera? Or the Ferrari FXX-K? What about a Top Fuel Dragster? OH I KNOW I GOT IT - a Formula 1 car. That has to be it right? WRONG. The most expensive car ever made, at least to my knowledge, is a car is from the 19-fucking-60s. The Ferrari 250 GTO. ![Somebody paid $70 million for it in 2018.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/01/this-ferrari-just-became-the-most-expensive-car-ever-sold.html) It was more expensive than a fucking F18 Super Hornet and no, unlike the F18, it doesn't fly. "WTF HOW? WHY?" The original MSRP was $18,000 (not adjusted for inflation) and somewhere over the past 50 years, millionaires got together and decided this was THE classic car to own just because they liked it enough. It doesn't matter if it's the fastest car in the world or built entirely with carbon fiber with a V16 twin turbo with KERS and 3 electric motors or can please your wife while her boyfriend drives it - what matters is what somebody is willing to pay for it. IF the demand is there and supply is low enough like it is with the 250 GTO (something like 36 cars ever made), the price will follow. No exceptions. You have something (the 250 GTO) and they need it. You will get whatever stupid fucking price you ask and GME will have the world's highest market cap because they made a stupid bet and the people held. But this is only if you hold. 

#Yes GME can have a trillion dollar market cap because Stone Cold said so.
