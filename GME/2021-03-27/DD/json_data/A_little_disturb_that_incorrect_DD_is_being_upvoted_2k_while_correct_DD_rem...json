    "selftext": "I am all for positive news around GME but if we haven\u2019t learned from the past, it\u2019s that bad DD can be destructive. Please remember DD stands for due diligence; not a bra size.\n\nI am not a shill, and mean no disrespect to the OP of this DD:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me59wg/gme_annual_shareholder_meeting_agm_recalling_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nBut he is completely wrong and glosses over many facts like **a company cannot initiate a shareholder recall! It\u2019s never been done before because it can\u2019t happen!** (See below DD for why).\n\nMeanwhile, I posted similar DD a few days ago that has gotten little attention on the very same subject matter:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbw22d/how_ryan_cohen_can_trigger_a_guaranteed_squeeze/\n\nHowever it has less than 50 upvotes.\n\nI\u2019m happy to debate why one DD might be right or wrong, but it\u2019s ultimately up to the community to decide. \n\nI\u2019m not surprised this is happening, but am a bit sad after all we have been through with bad DD and dates, I would expect the community to get more critical of DD. \n\nAgain, no offense to the OP. I\u2019m sure he meant well, but there\u2019s no way in hell what he wrote makes any sense or is fact. It\u2019s a lot of writing...and it seems if someone writes a big post then they must have spent a lot of time on their DD. No, a big post is just that - a big post.",
