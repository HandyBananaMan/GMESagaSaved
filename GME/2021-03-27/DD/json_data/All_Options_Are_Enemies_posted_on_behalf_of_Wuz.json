ALL OPTIONS ARE ENEMIES. This is the game the shorts have now chosen to play, and our long whales are inflicting max pain with lower price point closings. STOP PUSHING THE GAMMA SQUEEZE (we don\u2019t need it), stop buying options (you are wasting your money if our long whales thought options were profitable they would be purchasing them), STOP SETTING EXPECTATIONS AND DATES. Let our kongs do their work and send these short bear fucks into a liquidity black hole. Be patient apes our time is coming.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9VQye6P8k0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9VQye6P8k0)\n\nEMBRACE THE GRIND.
