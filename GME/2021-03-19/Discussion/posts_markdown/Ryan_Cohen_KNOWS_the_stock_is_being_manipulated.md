Ryan Cohen owns 9M shares. He also knows all the institutional players that own large portions. He also has access to a Bloomberg terminal and can see that institutions own 115% of the total number of shares. Ryan also knows that the Reddit community is huge and also has a TON of shares.

So why does this matter? Because he has the ability to do a few things which absolutely would destroy the shorts/synthetic shares. And why would he want to do that? Well, his 9 million shares at $200 = $1.8B. At $2,000/share his total is $18B, etc. This continued fuckery is messing with his giant stake as much as anyone.

So what can Ryan do as quickly as this earnings call?

1. He could offer a special one-time dividend to every share. Rocket mortgage did this and it sent their stock through the roof. And who pays that dividend. All those short positions do.
2. He could issue a stock split (ie 10 shares for 1). So everyone would instantly have 10X the amount of stock. Why would this matter? Because at just $20, everyone can easily join the revolution. Those $20 shares would likely accelerate to $40-50 quickly. That acceleration would trigger the April 16th Call Options train further crushing the shorts/synthetic shares.
3. He can recall the shares (actually likely) so they can vote on a new board. Recalling the shares exposes this synthetic share issue front and center.
4. GameStop can report outstanding revenue and show guidance that convinces everyone that the market cap calculation is way too low.
5. As the market cap for GameStop increases (either through the shares, better game plan, execution, etc), GameStop will be put into more and more ETFs.

What does this all mean? Just enjoy the weekend and chill. The short/synthetic problem is worsening. Do you know what you do when your opponent is killing himself? You let him continue to do that.

We don't need to do anything but wait until the conference call that happens after hours on Tuesday. It's likely, Ryan Cohen does at least a few of these and I expect the guidance going forward to be stellar.

See you guys on Pluto.
