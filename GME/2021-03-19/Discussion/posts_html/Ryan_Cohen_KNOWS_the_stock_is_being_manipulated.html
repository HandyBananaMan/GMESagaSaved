<p>Ryan Cohen owns 9M shares. He also knows all the institutional players that own large portions. He also has access to a Bloomberg terminal and can see that institutions own 115% of the total number of shares. Ryan also knows that the Reddit community is huge and also has a TON of shares.</p>
<p>So why does this matter? Because he has the ability to do a few things which absolutely would destroy the shorts/synthetic shares. And why would he want to do that? Well, his 9 million shares at $200 = $1.8B. At $2,000/share his total is $18B, etc. This continued fuckery is messing with his giant stake as much as anyone.</p>
<p>So what can Ryan do as quickly as this earnings call?</p>
<ol>
<li>He could offer a special one-time dividend to every share. Rocket mortgage did this and it sent their stock through the roof. And who pays that dividend. All those short positions do.</li>
<li>He could issue a stock split (ie 10 shares for 1). So everyone would instantly have 10X the amount of stock. Why would this matter? Because at just $20, everyone can easily join the revolution. Those $20 shares would likely accelerate to $40-50 quickly. That acceleration would trigger the April 16th Call Options train further crushing the shorts/synthetic shares.</li>
<li>He can recall the shares (actually likely) so they can vote on a new board. Recalling the shares exposes this synthetic share issue front and center.</li>
<li>GameStop can report outstanding revenue and show guidance that convinces everyone that the market cap calculation is way too low.</li>
<li>As the market cap for GameStop increases (either through the shares, better game plan, execution, etc), GameStop will be put into more and more ETFs.</li>
</ol>
<p>What does this all mean? Just enjoy the weekend and chill. The short/synthetic problem is worsening. Do you know what you do when your opponent is killing himself? You let him continue to do that.</p>
<p>We don't need to do anything but wait until the conference call that happens after hours on Tuesday. It's likely, Ryan Cohen does at least a few of these and I expect the guidance going forward to be stellar.</p>
<p>See you guys on Pluto.</p>
