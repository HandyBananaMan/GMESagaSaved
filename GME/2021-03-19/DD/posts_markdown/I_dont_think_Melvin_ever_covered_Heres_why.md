TL;DR Melvin’s initial short position was 50 million shorted shares. Possibly 63 million shares at the end of February.

lemme Pre-face this with: No pictures (It's late and I'm tired. Maybe if I dont get shit on for posting this, I'll do it fancy style because Apes love pictures. Also, no rockets because I'm on my computer. I am sorry, fellow apes.)

Melvin Capital was given 2.75 billion by Citadel and Point72 when GME was priced at approx. $76 on 25 january.

Why? Lets assume This money was a mandatory deposit to meet collateral requirements against short positions on GME.

On 25 January, news broke that Melvin had lost approximately 3 billion dollars and would be receiving an infusion of 2.75 billion from Citadel and Point 72.

It’s safe to assume that Melvin had lost approximately 3 billion dollars from a price **increase**  on his shorts. Doing some smoothbrain analysis on the charts, in the months leading up to the initial squeeze, we see constant and strong sell pressure at the 20 dollar resistance line for GME in time periods correlated to severe short share shortages on Iborrow as well as some short shortages around $11. For the sake of simplicity, we’re take the halfway point between the two prices and assume $15 was the point of entry for most short positions after averaging down from any former gains.

On 25 January, the price of GME had risen to 76 dollars, or \*\*61 dollars\*\* increase (difference) from short entry point to the day that Melvin received 2.75 Billion dollars.

So doing quick math $3 Billion/$61 = 50,000,000 ± 4,000,000 shares (for my earlier averaging)—This is  almost the **entire float** being shorted by Melvin at that point. An odd coincidence it falls so spot on?

With Melvins initial worth being \~12.75 billion, He suffered 3 billion in losses, but was given 2.75 billion. **What if the purpose wasn’t to buy more shorts** for market manipulation, but **instead** was to meet margin maintenance requirements on his short position? Anyone with half a brain and insider knowledge would have known that 2.75 billion would be enough to do exactly fuckall in the face of what was coming. So we can assume that by 25Jan it was determined that they were going to get margin called, and we’re instead given this money in an effort **delay** margin call until a solution could be enacted.

Lets do some quick math:We determined that Melvin had \~50 million shares. In the morning period of 25January, the day of the reported losses and cash infusement, the price spiked to $150. Their short position became a liability of **-7.5billion**, bringing their overall capital down to **7.25** billion (which we can safely assume would fail any margin requirement at that point). *coincidentally* the price gets shorted down to \~$70 by noon of the same day—prior to the release of the loss/infusement news, bringing Melvin’s short position to a liability of -3.5billion and an overall capital value of 12.5 billion.

knowing this, We can assume that 70 is safe from causing a margin call, just as surely as 150 enacts it. So somewhere between the price of $70-150 we hit position+margin maintenance requirement =14.75 billion (equity + 2.75 from blackrock). So margin requirement is between 250% for 70$/s to 65% for 150$/s.

Being that the squeeze didn’t begin until 28 January, and the price ended around 150 on the 26th, I believe it’s reasonable to assume that the margin limitations were here at 65%.

Then 27Jan Happens, the price blows past $150, and Melvin gets issued “Post X$ amount to prevent margin call by business open on the next day,” command, but doesn’t. 28 JAN happens. Skyrocket because of a forced margin call, but then the GME solution is enacted. We all know the rest.

What’s important here?Melvins initial short position was around 50 million shares.Melvins collateral requirements are between 65% and 250% from whatever institution they’re using.

But what else have we learned? That Melvin Capital also gained 20% in February, but their next largest holdings posted .3% gains. They also released that they owned 8 Billion dollars in managed assets at the end of January.

Did Melvin short the whole way down on GME, is that how he gained? I hate math, so we’ll just do some estimates to get roughly how many shares that’s worth. We’ll assume the shares came in only two prices (the high and low), $411 and $70 and graph (20% of 8 billion) 1.6 billion = 411x +70y, then pick the number sets that give us a 1:2.6 ration derived from comparing volumes of days nearest the 411 price against volume of days nearest the 70 price, and come up with approximately 12 million shares of $70 and 1 million shares of 411, for a total of 13 million shorts that would have been added on the way down.

The price eventually dropped an additional 20 dollars, and at this point, there’s just no more additional data.

So lets figure out what the Melvin’s Shorts would look like on 26FEB, and see if we can score something close to **9.6 Billion**, a 20% increase from his January ending report of 8 billion As reported.

So 14.75 Billion

50,000,000 shares \* (15-85) = - 4.25 billion12,000,000\*(70-85) = -360 million1,000,000\* (411-85) = 311 million

Total = 10.45 Billion.Wtf? How is this estimate ahead of where he should be even if we assume he DIDN'T Cover his initial shorts?! he’s hurting almost a billion more than he should be hurting even if he had covered none of his shares at the tops, and shorted all the way down. So what Gives?

What if never covered his initial position AND He shorted all the way down from top,  AND also averaged his new shares to the low of 40 dollars, compared against the price when he would have said he was 20% ahead of 8 billion...?

50,000,000x-70 = -4.25 billion13,000,000x-70=-910 million**= 9.6 billion**

Nice.

I will poke a hole in my own theory though-- For this to be true, Melvin needs to have hid 35 million short shares somewhere, lest he would be margin called for hitting his 65% cap mentioned earlier when the price hit 150. although that would ironically match the Short interest data posted by FINRA.

Bonus data: there's simply no Volume at prices that would have matched Melvins claim to both covering AND having 8 billion at the end of January. I compared all intraday volumes with prices... and even the Dark Pool. If he covered, It didn't happen in a such a short time-- which they implied when the price peaked and they said they covered.

**Edit 1**: if you’re responding direct to my thread, I’m trying to answer, and I want to thank you for taking your time to share your input. Thank you. So here's my favorite questions so far, because all criticism and opinions are welcome here!

\\\\\\=====Q&A=====///

**Edit 2 Question:**

>" are we ignoring the money that could have been potentially made from options? Wouldn’t they get rolled up into the same lumpsum profits made off their GME dealings disclosed?"

Answer:

>"Let me throw it this way. The limiting factor for tracing their gains wasn’t ”not enough money,” the problem was “Too much money” and not enough volume.  
>  
>So could they have been profiting off options? Absolutely. But that would mean they would need a bigger negative to offset their gains to match their claimed equity. By ignoring profits from options, I’m actually being more conservative in shorted shares estimates.  
>  
>I see your point, but it’s technically in the other direction. To generate synthetic shares, there’s a small mismatch with price parity to the actual share, so that could have cost them money and decreased my estimate for shares shorted— or if they were buying call, then the premiums would have cost them money, and that would actually reduce the shares I estimated.  
>  
>To bring their income LOW ENOUGH, they couldn’t have profited off options."

\--------------------

**Edit 3 Question:**

>So then, the million dollar (per share) question is: at what share price  will Melvin/Citadel be margin called  forced to cover now?

Answer

>Assuming that the margin maintenance requirements hadn't change, then the magic number is **$172**.Now clearly we're past that point, so what gives? That's what my reference to the hidden $30 million shares was for. However, there are 4 possibilities:  
>  
>1 I'm wrong.  
>  
>2) The collateral requirement changed  
>  
>3) Their funds changed (which is annotated only once in an article [Here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-melvin/melvin-capital-ends-month-with-over-8-billion-in-assets-after-investors-added-cash-source-idUSKBN2A00KW))  
>  
>4) Citadel, in addition giving them funds on 25January, helped restructure whatever agreement Melvin had for short shares, and is weighing the equity against their own Hedgfund rather than Melvins.  
>  
>I, personally, believe Option 4 is the truth of the matter, and here's why:  
>  
>The ceiling for GME has been $350. Look at any of the spikes, and if they broke 350, they're were pushed into the ground. What does 350 represent? 350\*63million shares = 22 Billion, enough to bankrupt Melvin, and likely start a margin call against citadel. (whose worth is \~$30 Billion)  
>  
>**I believe that Melvin doesn't have a magic number, but that Citadel does now, and it's 350.**  
>  
>^(Sure, you can check out citadel, just be aware that there are 3 branches of citadel, but that overall, citadel is worth \~34 billion. the AUM of citadel includes discretionary investments, or essentially all of their capacity as a market maker-- which stands independent of their hedgefund regardless)

I had an entire new post involving this, but I hadnt done my DD and deleted it until I had. For now, I'll just let it rest here and repost if the this post falls into obscurity.
