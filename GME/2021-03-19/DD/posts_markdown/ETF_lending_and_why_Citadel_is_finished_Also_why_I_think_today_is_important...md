**ALL EDITS HAVE BEEN MOVED TO THE BOTTOM, APART FROM ONE. I am continually updating this post as more is learnt surrounding ETFs. Thanks for all your help you beautiful apes!**

**YES, THE ETF'S CAN LEND OUT INDIVIDUAL GME SHARES FROM ITS' PORTFOLIO. THEY CAN DROP THE PRICE OF THE BASKET STOCK (XRT) BY SHORTING BUT THEY CAN ALSO BORROW STOCKS FROM THE PORTFOLIO.**

**There is absolutely no reason to believe they haven't done both.**

I wanted to do some digging on ETFs and how exactly they rebalance their books and what it could mean for GME today. As apes know, today is the day at which this occurs. As king ape u/Rensole states, be nice to each other.

***THESE ARE PURELY MY BELIEFS FROM MY OWN RESEARCH.***

# Shares, Shares, Shares

As of 18th March, XRT holds 11.79% of the fund in Gamestop. 428,292 shares. Just thought it was relevant.

## How does securities lending work?

**Here's a wrinkled brain dumbing it down for us apes...**

*Your ETF may agree to lend a particular security to a third party. In return, the borrower pays a fee plus collateral to cover the value of the security while it’s on loan.*

*If the borrower refused to return the security (a default), then the lender can sell the collateral to cover the loss.*

*In the meantime, the lender will often reinvest the collateral to generate extra income during the loan period.*

***Often the value of the collateral is higher than the security which helps protect the lender from adverse changes in the market price.***

*Most ETF providers check the collateral’s value daily and may request more if it falls too far.*

*Loans are usually made on an ‘open’ basis. That means the loan isn’t for a fixed duration but can be called in at any time. (Very helpful if conditions deteriorate and the lender wants to reduce their exposure to the borrower quickly). Legal ownership of the security actually transfers to the borrower, so they can return its value in cash or other securities if they wish – enabling the lender to buy it back in the market as necessary.*

&#x200B;

**WELL WELL WELL. I BELIEVE MR. GRIFFIN'S COLLATERAL MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH ANYMORE.**

**Could this be why the bonds were issued and capital was needed??**

**OR**

**They're not intending to return the shares at all.**

Maybe the ETFs call in their shares with this rebalance? Maybe they raised capital (ie. Cash) to return the **value** of the stock of GME today?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So that's initial ape theory.... BUT READ ON... IT GETS BETTER**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

*The chief risk associated with security lending is that a borrower may default.*

***In that scenario, an ETF provider recovers their position by selling their collateral on the market and repurchasing the lost securities.***

***The danger is that poor quality collateral may be highly illiquid or difficult to value. You wouldn’t want to be selling Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) in 2008.***

*For that reason, the* [*EU’s UCITS rules*](https://www.justetf.com/uk/news/etf/legal-structure-of-etfs-ucits.html) *prescribe a set of risk-control standards on UCITS ETF collateral, and most of the major players impose stricter criteria still.*

*For example, collateral may consist of G-10 government debt, high quality corporate debt (A1 or above), and equities from approved OECD markets.*

*Rules also govern the level of collateral diversification (no more than 30% from a single issuer) and security lending counterparties must have a minimum credit rating of* ***A2 or above.***

&#x200B;

**Well it seems to me Citadels bonds may have been the collateral... but rated at BBB? BBB IS DOGSHIT and the ETF can't accept that as collateral.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# BUT WHAT IF THEIR COLLATERAL IS NO LONGER ENOUGH?...

&#x200B;

*If the lent and collateral portfolios were identical then there would be no market risk. In practice, of course, the lent and collateral portfolios are often very different.*

T*he lender’s risk is that the market value of the lent securities increases but that of the collateral securities falls before rebalancing can be effected.*

*Provided the counterpart has not defaulted, the lender will be able to call for additional collateral on any adverse collateral/loan price movements. However, following default, it will be exposed until it has been able sell the collateral and replace the lent securities.*

&#x200B;

**In short? If the ETF decides that there's a high risk of GME rocketing (think earnings...), it will want to get borrowed shares back ASAP. If Citadels collateral won't cover it or has dropped in value, the ETFs ARE EXPOSED.**

&#x200B;

**IN MY OPINION, ETFs ARE GOING TO WANT THE SHARES RETURNED. GMEs volatility is too high. Whether they want them returned to HODL like us apes (my opinion) or just not be at risk of the squeeze, they will want them back. I believe this could be done in the rebalance.**

&#x200B;

**TL,DR: ETFs reduce their exposure when lending out shares by taking collateral. If a squeeze is at risk, the borrowers collateral might not be enough to cover in the event of a squeeze. They are on the hook to buy them back at market price. May recall shares from HF instead of collateral due to market risk and volatility.**

Edit - Regarding a rebalance, '***Effective before the opening of business on Monday 22 March,...each fund set forth below will be rebalanced'***

*It seems to be the final hour this all happens! I'm excited to see what comes of it.*

&#x200B;

**Edit 2** \- The wrinkly brained Ape u/CoastalHotdog835 shared some extremely good points which need sharing -

***Citadel issuing bonds is not uncommon and raising 600 million may have been for some larger purpose. That doesn't mean to say that there's no reason it couldn't have been used for GME.***

***Also, the shares they are borrowing are the ETFs shares, not exclusively GME's. As it stands, it's about 10% of XRTs holding, meaning every 10 shares of XRT shorted is the equivalent of 1 GME. XRT short interest is still 141% though!***

**Edit 3 - So here are the dates for dividends for ETFs. The 25th is the date to pay up.**

[That's next Thursday they have to be paid by.](https://preview.redd.it/52n6ptf7t0o61.png?width=1406&format=png&auto=webp&s=2016fc706a6a9712404813f11881c92af5b3de41)

**Edit 4 - BUT WAIT THERES MORE.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vr2nies4w0o61.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbd6ee758c21a7edb5756aab34734faa4d67fcb1

**So this is before we even knew about hiding in ETFs. As of the 12/31/2020, the collateral received for XRT was 50 million in cash and 50 million in common stock. (See Retail ETF, thats XRT)**

&#x200B;

**Edit 5 - I apologise for the spamming but some great points around the fact that these funds are** ***'Equal weighted funds'.***

That's correct. XRT (I just use this as it's easier to refer to) is an equal weight fund. This means that:

*Indicies that are weighted equally are inherently value-based. The index fund is divided equally between all companies that are included in the index, so when shares of company A go up and shares of company B go down, the fund has to sell some shares of Company A and buy some shares of Company B in order to balance it equally again.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Edit 6 - So looking back historically at XRT (this will continue to be my reference), it has been un-even with GME for quite a while. Though the shares have continued to dwindle lower and lower.**

**March 2020 - 805,000 shares**

**September 2020 - 611,000 shares**

**December 2020 - 555,374 shares**

**March 18 - 428,292 shares**

&#x200B;

**(And you might think** ***'oh but is this the SLOW short squeeze?'.*** No. It's not. That's too smooth brained...even for me.)

&#x200B;

So what happened on the 19th? Well if it's anything to go by on their previous holdings they aren't selling their shares anytime soon. Would you?

**Think about it. They invested the collateral to make a little bit of money on the side while the shares were lent out. Here's where it gets fishy....**

&#x200B;

**They're either:**

**A. Making too much money from those investments**

**OR**

**B. They've invested that collateral somewhere just as god damn awful as Kenny's short position in GME. How can you return the collateral if you decided to bet it all on 55 at the roulette table?...**

&#x200B;

My thoughts are the second one... want to know why?

*Securities lending is not risk-free, even with the 2%-5% additional buffer required of collateral. If an ETF invests its collateral in overly risky instruments, the fund (and ultimately its investors) is responsible for covering any shortfall in returning the borrower's collateral. In this case, the risks assumed by the ETF provider and the ETF's investors are asymmetric:* ***The provider is not liable for losses, but is free to gamble with the shares and take a cut of any profits. As a*** [***GAO report on securities lending***](http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125767.pdf) ***pointed out, this arrangement gives incentive to securities-lending programs to invest collateral in an overly aggressive manner.***

*Loaned shares are also subject to the possibility of counterparty risk, or the risk that the borrower won't follow through with its obligation to return shares. Almost all ETF providers disclose very minimal information about their programs, which means investors could be taking on more risk in their portfolio than meets the eye. There are several cases of fund providers being sued by investors for not sufficiently disclosing risks and then losing money. A notable example was Lehman's bankruptcy, which meant entities that loaned securities to Lehman never saw their holdings again.*

***This is speculation. ETF's hold their cards close regarding how they invest the collateral.***

Summary so far:

&#x200B;

* ETFs have a rebalancing day every quarter. They may sell or buy shares to even the portfolio.

&#x200B;

* ETFs can allow lending of individual GME shares from its' portfolio, nearly identical to a pawn shop. You borrow, put up collateral, return at a later date.

&#x200B;

* The ETFs generally reinvest that collateral to make money on the side. This is usually aggressive and high risk.

&#x200B;

* ETFs also allow borrowing of the fund's stock (to short). XRT is 141% short interest.

&#x200B;

* ETFs can recall the borrowed shares at any point. Might not be able to due as the collateral investments were very risky and haven't paid off.

&#x200B;

Yes, I have reason to believe the entire system is fraudulent and the entire economy is based upon the lending securities market. No-one HODLs anymore. They lend it out for interest payments and then re-invest the interest payments to buy stock from somebody else...that was also borrowed.

&#x200B;

Damn I love my Ritalin.
