# Title: ATTENTION DATA FANS: the gme-data repository now collecting options chain, borrowable shares, short volume, and failure to deliver data in uniform text formats

I started this repo a couple days ago but it didn't get much attention. Have been adding to it ever since:

[https://github.com/tangentstorm/gme-data](https://github.com/tangentstorm/gme-data) (clean data is in the `gme` folder)

I'm looking for collaborators on this - especially to help backfill older data.
