# Title: Ken Griffin Bought an apartment in New York for $268,000,000. He could have donated $10,000 to 26,800 people. Is that not life changing for people? We as a community barely have anything and we give to each other.

These billionaires donâ€™t care about the common man. 1 house vs changing the lives of 23,800 people. We will change the world soon at their expense. 

Edit 1: sorry it was 238 million. https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-most-expensive-home-ever-sold-us-nyc-penthouse-2019-1

Edit 2: someone shared this too. Does he really need so many houses?
