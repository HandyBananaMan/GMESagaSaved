I work at a gym and this guy comes in asking about his account with us, we’re sitting at my desk talking and I see him on his phone looking at stocks, he tells me sorry in advance if i feel like he’s not paying attention to what I’m saying, he was busy with his options trades expiring today. 

We sparked up a conversation about GME and he was telling me how in February he shorted the stock and lost from 10-15k!!! But his next move was to set a put to sell it anything below 450 and when we saw that massive drop he said he made back like 5k and cashed out. I’m sure him and his buddies are did the same.

He was telling me that him and his buddies don’t believe in GameStop as a company and are still betting for it to go out of business, he said that no one buys video games in store anymore, I’m assuming he doesn’t keep up with what GameStop is actually doing? Anyway I told him I owned a few shares but not how many I had, he told me “ha you need to get out of that! It’s going to drop, the company is way overpriced” then said “I recommend you sell your shares and take the profit for a nice dinner or whatever” that did piss me off, he acted as if my gains aren’t anything special but a nice dinner. 

His price target is $50 and if that’s what he thinks I’m sure all his other hedgies are thinking the same, to keep shorting and shorting. These guys have special language they speak in when they speak about losses or gains they refer them as cars, “today I lost a mustang” or “today I got a Benz”. His advice to me was to sell and become a paper hands but I’m not planning on it anytime. 

These hedge funds think we are stupid for buying GME and are still confident about coming out on top, after speaking with him I realized no matter what everyone should keep on holding, it was never about the money, it’s about making a statement that is little guys can come out on top too. I refuse to sell my shares especially after talking with him, this is bigger than we think, he might work for a smaller hedge fund but they all have the same mentality of shorting these companies to oblivion. 

This is not financial advice, I am smooth brained and don’t even know how to count to my price target for GME. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
