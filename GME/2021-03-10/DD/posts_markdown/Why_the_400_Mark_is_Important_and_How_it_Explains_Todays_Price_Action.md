I was asked to write a follow up DD about a post I made yesterday about the 400$ price point for GME, and why I think if we pass that point, the hedge fund's ability to play their game would be *dramatically* impaired. If you would like to see the post about it, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1igsy/why_the_400_mark_will_be_the_straw_that_breaks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but here's the TLDR:

&#x200B;

* Yesterday, it was more or less confirmed through options volume that the hedge funds had been concealing their FTD's via deep ITM options.

**Edit**: I've been receiving some questions as to how the FTD's could be hidden in deep ITM calls. There's a nice DD about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m05jed/mystery_solved_the_deep_itm_calls_are_coming_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that explains it beautifully, but the TLDR of it is that they are basically using synthetic shares (shares that MM like Citadel can create by acting like they have the shares to sell contracts when they actually don't), using those synthetic shares to create call contracts, and then exercising said call contracts as a way of reporting a net even position to the SEC, making it look like their FTD's are cleared. 

&#x200B;

* Through the options volume, we see that a large amount of their FTD's most likely reside at the price points of around 300$, and 400$.
* It is more than likely that a large amount of the call volume purchased at these price points are hedge funds hedging against their losses, and that if we especially pass 400$, the hedge fund's ability to remain solvent will become exponentially worse.

&#x200B;

Here is how today's price action strengthens these points *a fuck ton*.

As we know by now, GME did some wacky stuff today. Straight **bonkers**. It dropped by over 150$ in the span of around 20 minutes. At what point did this happen? It was at the price point of about 344$ before Melvin and co. just shat on the stock like they had taco bell for dinner. Why is this price point important? Well, a large amount of options volume were at 300$ and 400$, and it looked like we were about ready to moon. The hedge fund's didn't like that of course, but it was the *aggression* with which they made the play that showed their desperation.  It leads me to believe that there may be some more truth to the idea that a large amount of their FTD's reside at these price points, and also to the idea that they *really* don't want us passing the 400$ mark. To the point that they put themselves at risk of getting GME on the SSR List (which it ended up doing, which now puts them at even *more* risk).

What's even crazier is the call options volume and OI from 300-400$:

Strangely enough, after the price decreased, there was an *increase* in the amount of calls (in both volume and open interest) not only at 300$ and 400$, but also at many places in between. I see a large group of them seemingly around the 350$ mark ( again, the price was at around 344$ before it crashed so it leads me to believe they have a large amount of FTD's at 350$ as well).

My theory here is that what we saw today was actually a **bear trap** by Melvin and co. that went horribly wrong for them as other institutional competitors saw the opportunity to trigger the SSR, which I'm gonna safely assume is what Melvin *didn't* want given they've been avoiding shorting the stock to that point for multiple days now. I say this given the many media outlets that went silent this week about the GME increase seemingly ***all pounced*** around the similar time that GME dropped, like it was all a *planned effort* to bring negative sentiment to the stock, allowing some more puts to be sold that Melvin and Co. needed to be sold, and more importantly *more calls to be bought at a cheaper price to better hedge against their losses* before the price corrected back upwards.

If my theory happens to be correct, then the squeeze may be even **nearer** than we think, and with GME on the SSR list for the whole day tomorrow, we may just see a large gamma squeeze tomorrow that may kick start the short squeeze in the near future, and combined with FOMO the MOASS.
