**I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH: READ THE EDITS!!! PEOPLE KEEP ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS I ALREADY ANSWERED THERE.**

EDIT1: SOMEONE WANTS THIS SHIT TO MOON REALLY BAD AND LOADED UP ON OVER 30,000 - 60,000 ADDITIONAL OPTIONS BETWEEN $300 and $400, EXPIRING FRIDAY MARCH 12TH. (Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET) That is an increase of another 20,000 Calls from just 10 Minutes ago!

**Edit2:** (UPDATED 03/10 7:37PM **CET**) Another 8,000 Calls @ 800 were bought within the last 5 minutes. That's just flexing at that point.

Edit3: I just refreshed the options page 3 times within a few seconds and there are more and more options coming in every second. Someone wants this to be much much bigger than we anticipated.

Edit4: I am gonna update all the numbers later. There is literally no point, because the call volume keeps increasing every few seconds at the moment.

Edit5: **Why did they do it today, and not tomorrow so the SSR rule is active for friday**? Because I think without this intervention, we would've mooned today if would've hit $350. But the Gamma Squeeze wouldn't have been as big as it will be now, because they loaded up on almost 100,000 more Call options. That's more than 10.000.000 Shares having to get bought, just by todays additional call volume. I think they wanted to make this moon even more all along and now this was the right (and last) moment, to prepare the biggest Gamma Squeeze ever.

Edit6: They actually used the same tactic 2 weeks ago and I found out about it beforehand: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrijdv/my\_theory\_for\_todays\_market\_close\_get\_ready\_for\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrijdv/my_theory_for_todays_market_close_get_ready_for_a/)

Edit7: **Just wanted to clarify: The Open Interest for Options get's updated EOD/TMRW**. Then we will see, how many new calls were added exactly. Volume is not 1:1 to OI, but seeing this huge spike in volume atm gives me reason to belive they added a shit ton of Calls. As I said: How many exactly, we will see tomorrow.

Edit 8: Why did news outlets get in on this so quick? They probably didn't think about it and just wanted to push the "GME Squeeze is over 2.0" narrative ASAP in order to help Shitadel & Friends and set off a huge panic sell.

&#x200B;

This might sound stupid or crazy, because I am just a crayon eating dipshit. But here is what I think just happend. No financial advice, just a theory, bla bla bla.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** I think the Hedgefunds that want to fuck Shitadel & Friends just caused this drop by selling a large amount of shares, in order to trigger the SSR and to load up some shares and options with a lower base price / premium. (**Read the Edits above for more information! I answer most of the questions there!**)

&#x200B;

EDIT I: GME IS OFFICIALLY ON THE SSR FOR TODAY!

![https:\/\/ftp.nyxdata.com\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers\/current\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210310.xls](https://preview.redd.it/fqn6bg8zxcm61.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=018ed431ec61dd843c95a9ea78f5b103d9af7e66)

I. In order to trigger the SSR, the price had to drop to $222.21.

![NYSE just confirmed the SSR Trigger: https:\/\/ftp.nyxdata.com\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers\/current\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210310.xls](https://preview.redd.it/okc330ono8m61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3bc51f125afd690cff295dcc60d13f1a82e2caa)

&#x200B;

II. The price rose steadily with more and more options becoming ITM. Before the real Gamma Squeeze starts, they want to make sure, that Shitadel & Friends can't short GME tomorrow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

III. While GME dropped down to $172 (from $340, holy shit), almost all Stocks in my Portfolio went red and looked the same. I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger.

**Edit: (7:52PM CET)** Seems like a was right with this "I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger."

IV.  I'll have to wait and look at the Open Interest and Volume for Options in the evening and tomorrow. But someone loaded up on a shit load of $800 Calls for this friday. There was a volume of 24,244 Calls and there is an open interest of about 22,000.

**Edit2:** (UPDATED 03/10 7:37PM **CET**) Another 8,000 Calls @ 800 were bought within the last 5 minutes. That's just flexing at that point.

**EDIT3:** **SOMEONE WANTS THIS SHIT TO MOON REALLY BAD AND LOADED UP ON OVER 30,000 - 60,000 ADDITIONAL OPTIONS BETWEEN $300 and $400, EXPIRING FRIDAY MARCH 12TH**. (Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET) That is an increase of another 20,000 Calls from just 10 Minutes ago!. This shit is about to explode tomorrow, because we were able to reach those prices without a Squeeze today! This confirms me in my theory, that someoneTM just watched and saw, that retail can be trusted. **(Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET)**

Edit7: **Just wanted to clarify: The Open Interest for Options get's updated EOD/TMRW**. Then we will see, how many new calls were added exactly. Volume is not 1:1 to OI, but seeing this huge spike in volume atm gives me reason to belive they added a shit ton of Calls. As I said: How many exactly, we will see tomorrow.

V. Why trigger it now and not at opening? That's just pure speculation, but maybe they wanted to see, if people hold and buy the small dips today. People did and that gave them the cofirmation, that there won't be huge sell offs when this Rocket launches. (See picture @ point II); Also see edit5 @ top of the post.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**My theory of what is about to happen**: As I am writing this, the price currently sits at $205. **If it starts to rise really really fast again, we might just see the start of the Gamma Squeeze.** Trading will get halted multiple times, don't be scared! If you just bought this dip: Congratulations, future millionaire!

**Will it start today? I don't think so, but it's possible!** We **could** see a rise in price today and tomorrow GME will moon, because the SSR rule\* is in place. **I think we will close at about  $250 - $ 280 and tomorrow we'll go to the moon before the Short Squeeze.**

\*What is the SSR Rule?  The short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. That means they can only short on upticks. But not on downticks. What happens when they short on upticks? Nothing. They did that the last few days, the price dropped $10 - $15 and immediatly recovered a few minutes after. People also bought every dip, making it look like there is no way out for Shitadel & Friends now.

I WILL KEEP THIS POST UP TO DATE AS I AM COLLECTING MORE DATA AT THE MOMENT. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPEND.
