# Title: Hey ðŸ‘‹ Remember when the price dropped to $45? The media said young traders lost? They called the people in this group all kinds of names? Other Reddit groups called us crazy? Well, now itâ€™s at $280 in pre-market. Probably going to break $300 today. Idc if it hits 1k. Iâ€™m not selling. Love you all ðŸ™ŒðŸ’Ž
