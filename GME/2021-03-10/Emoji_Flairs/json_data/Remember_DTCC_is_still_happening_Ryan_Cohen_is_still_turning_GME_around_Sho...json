    "selftext": "Here\u2019s a PSA for you: Market Makers (Citadel and co) have a free-pass to naked short with the excuse that they\u2019re \u201cproviding liquidity and taming volatility\u201d.\n\nBrief example: Imagine you want to buy shares of a company and no one wants to sell (not at current price anyway) the market maker at his own discretion can sell you a stock he doesn\u2019t have in order to keep the BID-ASK spread fairly controlled. And  as he sells to you, he writes an IOU to your broker - this is naked shorting - and he has up to 6 days to fulfill the transaction with your broker (I say up to 6 because it depends on the security). This process creates phantom shares, meaning you are buying shares that aren\u2019t there, but don\u2019t worry as it is not your problem to fix!\n\nWhen you close your position / sell your shares you are helping these manipulators to close their phantom shares at lower prices - so stop helping them - **the fundamentals didn\u2019t change** as the title says",
