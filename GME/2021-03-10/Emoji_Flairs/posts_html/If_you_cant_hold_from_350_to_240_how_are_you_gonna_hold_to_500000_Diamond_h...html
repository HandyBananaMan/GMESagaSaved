<p>Edit: Dropped to 197... are they trying to scare us one last time?</p>
<p>Not financial advice but common sense says this isn't a natural drop. We've seen support throughout the week for it to crash this far down this quickly. Something about the 400 range scares them.</p>
<p>Edit 2: GME climbing back up to 262</p>
