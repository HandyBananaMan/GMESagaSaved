<p>Here’s a PSA for you: Market Makers (Citadel and co) have a free-pass to naked short with the excuse that they’re “providing liquidity and taming volatility”.</p>
<p>Brief example: Imagine you want to buy shares of a company and no one wants to sell (not at current price anyway) the market maker at his own discretion can sell you a stock he doesn’t have in order to keep the BID-ASK spread fairly controlled. And  as he sells to you, he writes an IOU to your broker - this is naked shorting - and he has up to 6 days to fulfill the transaction with your broker (I say up to 6 because it depends on the security). This process creates phantom shares, meaning you are buying shares that aren’t there, but don’t worry as it is not your problem to fix!</p>
<p>When you close your position / sell your shares you are helping these manipulators to close their phantom shares at lower prices - so stop helping them - <strong>the fundamentals didn’t change</strong> as the title says</p>
