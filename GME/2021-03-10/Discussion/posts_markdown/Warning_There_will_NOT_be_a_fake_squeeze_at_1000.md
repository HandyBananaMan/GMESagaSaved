#TL;DR : If you sell at $1,000 in the hopes of a dip from a massive short attack, YOU'LL MISS THE SQUEEZE.

I've now seen [multiple posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1j32k/beware_the_most_likely_hedge_fund_tactic_coming/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) of people claiming that the shorts will attack the stock heavily at $1,000 and bring it back down to sub-100 levels. And here's why I think this WON'T happen and might become the next shill tactic.

First off, let's look back at the January pre-squeeze. The shorties had to *cheat* and TURN OFF the buy button to get the price down when it reached close to 500$. 

##Let me rephrase, Robinhood and others had to change the rules of the game in order to bail them out. 

#That's how fucked they were.

That leads me to believe that the shorters were on the brink of getting margin called around the $500-$800 price point.

I've also seen plenty of DD on this sub that concluded that with the volume and price action in late Jan and February, there was no way the hedgies could have covered or repositioned their shorts. Therefore, the price at which they get margin called should still be the same. ~~Now that~~ *When and if* the new regulations pass, the DTCC will be able to check their balance every single day, which would make it even easier to margin call them.

Additionally, there was plenty of DD on the gamma squeezes and the **HUGE** number of call options open right now. This means that market makers could potentially buy millions of shares as the price goes higher and higher in order to delta hedge. 

#There's no way the hedgies can short millions of shares to bring the price down.

1. They are already on the brink of getting margin called. 
2. The inverse correlation of $SPY with $GME suggests that they had to sell their other positions in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to hold onto their shorts and to pay the the interest on them.
3. They simply don't have enough money to counter the INSANE bullish momentum we have right now.
4. Do you really think that, if they had that kind of shorting power, if they could stop the momentum we're having, they wouldn't have just driven the price to the ground the past couple of weeks? they wouldn't have just shot the price down from $180 straight back to $20 and kept it there for a month? Here's my takeaway from the recent price movements: They're out of ammo. They are losing the fight and they know it. Therefore they now rely on desperate "sell at $1k" FUD and media blackout. They don't want it to squeeze even higher. But it will.

##If you sell at 1k in the hopes of a short attack so that you can buy back in at a lower price, you'll miss the squeeze. 

The price will skyrocket so fast from the market makers scrambling to get millions of shares, from the shorts forced to buy back millions of shares and from the thousands of retail investors FOMOing into the stock, that you'll just be left in the dust, with tiny gains, and huge regret.

#Bottom line: if you sell before 100k-500k, you'll be bagholding $REGRET for the rest of your life.

Think about it: We've seen all the DD we could possibly want. Fundamental analysis says $GME is a strong buy. Technical analysis suggests $GME is going much much higher. $GME is shorted so fucking much that they will have to pay the price you want. 

##This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be greedy and change your life. Don't let it slip away.

Now, why might those "dip at 1k" posts become shill tactics? Because they claim with confidence that there will be a dip at 1k. What's the effect? Newbies will try to get a quick day trade out of it, and sell their shares. Now, this little amount of selling will have basically no impact on the squeeze, but these apes will miss the squeeze, because there will be no huge dip... 

Plus, think about the risk you'd be taking: selling at 1k and buying back in at say 200 would only get you 800 bucks/share of profit. *But you're risking 499k/share of profit!!!* 

#It simply doesn't make sense from a risk/reward perspective to day trade $GME, no matter your risk tolerance.

Another thing I'd like to address is the fear that GameStop might raise money by issuing millions more shares and saving the shorties in the process. I've seen a few comments about this and Uncle Bruce thinks it might happen (as much as I like him, I think his theory will not happen simply from a logical point of view). (Also, don't hate on him, he's an honest guy and he even predicted the $GME short squeeze when it was at $4)

*But heres why GameStop won't bail out the hedgies.*

Why would GameStop save the shorts who tried to bankrupt them with illegal naked shorting and maybe even more shady shit I'm not aware of? Why would GameStop issue shares at 1k or 10k when they know they could raise funds at 500k if they need the money? Why would GameStop stop a short squeeze that would benefit millions of retail investors?

###GameStop's customers are Redditors. GameStop's customers are retail investors. They're not hedge funds. They're not market makers. They're not any other institution.

If they dilute their shares and help the shorts, they would only shoot themselves in the foot. They would face immense backlash, similar to Robinhood. They would lose the faith of millions of individuals/potential customers. They would NEVER recover from such a nearsighted action, and Ryan Cohen, as the (possibly) new CEO, will never let that happen. 

#So, sit tight, hold, and buy more if you can. 

*not financial advice*

##Edit: No, it will NOT crash the economy...
In the wise words of u/rensole :

>Ok so I heard a lot of talk about "if it go's to 100k it will ruin the economy".
>
>No it may ruin the stock market for a hot minute but not the economy.
>
>why you ask? easy the Economy is not the stock market or vice versa.
>
>first of all 'ruin the economy' is, and always has been, a dogwhistle for rich people losing their superyachts, how many times was the "economy" ruined and the people on wall-street went on with business as usual?
>
>the thing is, once we get our gains and we pay the taxes the economy is back up.Due to the gains being put back into the economy right away (paying off debts, mortgages, bills in general) the economy will be healthier then ever, also we'll most likely see a lot of people start their own charity or business or something along the way.
>
>which also stimulates the economy further.
>
>So when they cry on tv saying "they're ruining the economy" no jackass we are doing the same thing to you that you did to all of us for years. the economy wont crash, the economy will flourish as people will for once be able to pay their bills, for once they'll be able to LIVE instead of EXIST to work from paycheck to paycheck.

Edit 2: The new DTCC regulations are not yet in action, but the point remains the same.

Edit 3: To clarify: dips will happen. I just believe the dips will be so incredibly small relative to the squeeze that the only logical thing to do is to buy and hold. However a dip from 1k to 100 will be virtually impossible because it's gonna be incredibly expensive to short gme at that price point. Plus, if they had that kind of resources they would have stopped the run-up in the last few days and driven it back down to 40 bucks.

Edit 4: post got removed from wsb lmao, had 1k updoots, 89% upvoted, 260 comments...

Edit 5: If you're new here and wondering what you should do: read the DD, do your own research, and if you can't afford to lose the money you're putting in, by all means take your profits and leave. However, i will personally hold until 6 digits.

Edit 6: *10/03 1:38pm* 
Welp, that was a sweet and exciting dip! I guess they had a single bullet left lmao. but they couldn't keep it low. It rebounded immediately, which makes me oh so incredibly more bullish on the stock. Plus, it's now on the short sale restriction list, meaning that they can't short on downticks anymore for the rest of the day and tomorrow, which can possibly mean no more short attacks today and tomorrow!!!

Edit 7: Now that I think about it, i believe the price at which shitadel gets margin called could actually be 350$. Because this short attack was most definitely an act of pure desperation. Someone out there REALLY didn't want it to hit 350 today. Plus, with all the short attacks they made in the past month, it wouldn't surprise me that they're now wayy over their head on margin. Anyway, keep holding! Someone with more brain wrinkles please look into the short attack ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
