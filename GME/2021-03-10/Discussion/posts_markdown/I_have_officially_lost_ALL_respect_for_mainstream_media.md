This whole gme situation showed me just how corrupt and manipulative CNBC and others (like the aptly named Motley Fool) are.

What little respect I had for traditional media has vanished into thin air and will likely never come back.

Today, we saw the hedgies organize what i believe was a massive short attack, and within 10-15 minutes, the MSM all come out with detailed pre-written articles talking about how gme dropped 40% and such. 

Meanwhile the previous week, gme went up 20% DAILY and they didn't let out even a single fart. 

#Goodbye MSM, you have caused your own demise. 

#Journalists, you'll be losing your jobs.

#CNBC, once the boomers are gone, your viewership will dip harder than gme ever did.

#You have taught the younger generation that you're not even remotely trustworthy

Don't get hit by the door on your way out.

*You will not be missed*
