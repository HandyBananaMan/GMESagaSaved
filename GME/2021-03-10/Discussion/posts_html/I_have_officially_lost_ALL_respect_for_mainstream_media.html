<p>This whole gme situation showed me just how corrupt and manipulative CNBC and others (like the aptly named Motley Fool) are.</p>
<p>What little respect I had for traditional media has vanished into thin air and will likely never come back.</p>
<p>Today, we saw the hedgies organize what i believe was a massive short attack, and within 10-15 minutes, the MSM all come out with detailed pre-written articles talking about how gme dropped 40% and such. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the previous week, gme went up 20% DAILY and they didn't let out even a single fart. </p>
<h1>Goodbye MSM, you have caused your own demise.</h1>
<h1>Journalists, you'll be losing your jobs.</h1>
<h1>CNBC, once the boomers are gone, your viewership will dip harder than gme ever did.</h1>
<h1>You have taught the younger generation that you're not even remotely trustworthy</h1>
<p>Don't get hit by the door on your way out.</p>
<p><em>You will not be missed</em></p>
