Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD MORNING APES!

None of this is financial advice, everything expressed here in a retards idea of whatsup.

# OMG THE GOVERNMENT

Ok so I've read a lot of people posting shit along the lines of "omg the government will halt this".

So lets address that right here where it get's the most exposure.

I don't think they will for several reasons, namely;

1. This is way, way bigger than just the US. Dozens of countries are involved in this. If the U.S tried to shut down trading there would be international consequences and people would no longer trust the USA to do business with, economically isolating and crippling the USA economy for years.
2. It would completely shatter market confidence and result in an exodus of investors. I don’t think the economy would ever recover from such a betrayal.
3. It’s in the governments best interest to let this play out. Not only will they get that sweet capital gains tax, they’ll look like the good guys. It could also lead to an economic explosion as millions of retail investors put their earnings back into the economy.
4. people say "but HF are connected" correct but this is bigger than just citadel or Apex, this is also other whales on our side, investors are like sharks once they smell blood in the water and see an opportunity to take out 1 or 2 competitors they'll do their best to take them out.

credit to  [u/HorseFacedDipShit](https://www.reddit.com/user/HorseFacedDipShit/) for writing this, I've adapted it a bit hope you don't mind.

We are now bigger than Mutual funds and Hedgefunds combined. Just let that idea set in for a minute.

by this graph alone... well they're no longer the sharks, we are. expect them to try and pull the plug at any given time, expect them to try everything to get out of this. but I personally don't think they're going to get out from under this.

they're under the scrutinizing eye of the entire world, remember

Hf's trying to pull the plug once got us a senate hearing.

if they'd do it again it's financial suicide.

# So why have we not yet gone BRRRR

these guys have a lot to lose in this situation, so don't expect them to take everything and just roll over, a cornered animal would do everything to survive, expect a greedy HF to do the same.

Most likely (what my smooth noggin thinks) is that they're trying to stall for a simple reason, liquidate other assets, move them off shore to a bank account which the usa can't touch so they have some money for after the bankrupcy.

You only go bankrupt once.

And the rich don't go broke like the rest of us. I go broke I'm crying in an old ass Camry, they go broke and they laugh in their Bahama vacation home.

# If this break $xxx dollars I'll do ....nothing!

Because I'll be holding to 100k minimum.

if I look at the graph it tells me the last spike was $347 (nasdaq) just to give you an idea we are just a 100 bucks or so away from that RIGHT NOW.

folding at a $1000 is still paperhanding in my book but that's just me, I'll be holding for 100 times that.

because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don't think we will ever see a situation like this ever again. especially with the new DTCC rules that are coming in.

Adjust your baseline and expectancy, adjust your view to see big numbers and see where the nice tendyman will bring you.

Because soon will the Tendyman come to take our rocket into the sun <3

Also some decent explanation of the new DTCC rules:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05AhD8QRW5I&ab\_channel=StonkNewsNetwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05AhD8QRW5I&ab_channel=StonkNewsNetwork)

yes I know the guy looks like a tool and a douchebag but his explanation to my understanding is not bad.

# Gme going 10k-50k-100k-500k

Ok so I heard a lot of talk about "if it go's to 100k it will ruin the economy".

No it may ruin the stock market for a hot minute but not the economy.

why you ask? easy the Economy is not the stock market or vice versa.

first of all  'ruin the economy' is, and always has been, a dogwhistle for rich people losing their superyachts, how many times was the "economy" ruined and the people on wall-street went on with business as usual?

the thing is, once we get our gains and we pay the taxes the economy is back up.Due to the gains being put back into the economy right away (paying off debts, mortgages, bills in general) the economy will be healthier then ever, also we'll most likely see a lot of people start their own charity or business or something along the way.

which also stimulates the economy further.

So when they cry on tv saying "they're ruining the economy" no jackass we are doing the same thing to you that you did to all of us for years. the economy wont crash, the economy will flourish as people will for once be able to pay their bills, for once they'll be able to LIVE instead of EXIST to work from paycheck to paycheck.

# But how will we get paid?

IDC if Jesus Christ himself has to pay me but lets break it down.

With the new DTCC ruling (if all go's well this will be implemented on the 19th of march... hmmm familiar date 👀) then they can hold specific people accountable for specific stock debts.

Meaning for example Melvin/shitadel can go bankrupt with all the debt, and the Fed runs it's money printer and write off that debt on a bankrupt company.

this is normal when a company go's bankrupt they get a debit and Credit part, guess Kenny G will have a huge debt on his ass when this blows up.

so lets make it simple.

will you get paid? for your stocks ? yes

Will the DTCC/FED/MELVIN/SHITADEL pay for this personally? not sure, all I know is that there is no stopping this anymore, or see above.

Does it matter who pays for the stocks? no, as long as we get paid we don't care.

if you sell your car do you care who comes and pays you? no as long as you get the money you want you're cool with it.

&#x200B;

**Addendum:**

apparently I was incorrect with something here, u/[axiscontra](https://www.reddit.com/user/axiscontra)  was kind enough to correct me

1. the 801 is an advanced notice and in line with Dodd-Frank and the SEC act of 1934 an advance notice does not require input from interested parties. So no waiting for a rebuttal if the SEC approves. NSCC also states this is a clarification of the language, not a new rule or entire rule change
2. IF the Commission (SEC) approves this, then the NSCC will implement this rule change no later than 10 business days after the approval. Big difference between regular days and business days. As the SEC has not yet approved the rule change then there is no indication of when it will go into effect. However, if the SEC approves today then the NSCC can implement the change anytime from today (business day 1) up until March 23 (business day 10)

# My expectations.

I think by looking at all the data I have available in front of me

    https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME
    https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/
    https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec
    https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/?p=gme&guccounter=1

I believe that they have one last ditch effort, they're going to let it rise to close to 1k (be it 500/750 or 800 or 1000) and then drop it down. just in an effort to get most of us to paperhand.

[u/OurLordOfWar](https://www.reddit.com/user/OurLordOfWar/)  did a write up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1n88r/they_will_more_than_likely_short_gme_at_1k/)

But let me surmise;

    They will let it rise.
    $500? $800? $1000?
    
    And as their last resource. They will make it drop RIGHT THERE and start with the media saying, that was it. That was the squeeze.
    
    The shills will spread FUD
    
    The shills will post gains that are tempting to the eye. Making you want to do the same.
    
    They will sooth your smooth brain with false words and false DD.
    
    They might go as far as closing all subreddits to cut communication and cause panic.
    
    An animal that is cornered and about to die will fight with everything they got. 

Now I hope with this you understand why we put in the "posting age requirement" and banned "gain and loss porn".

This is something we could see coming a mile away, but this time let's be smarten then them.

# 🚨PSA: NEW SHILL TACTIC IS TO ANNOUNCE WHOLESOME/CHARITY DEEDS ALONG WITH A LOW GME PRICE TAG LIKE 1K OR 10K

[u/slash\_sin\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/slash_sin_/)  did a writeup on this and seems dead on with it.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1f0cy/psa\_new\_shill\_tactic\_is\_to\_announce/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1f0cy/psa_new_shill_tactic_is_to_announce/)

Lot's of people saying "oh but I will donate to ST. Jude childrens hospital.

Sounds awesome right? well if you're in the UK you know that ST. Jude is one of the most overfunded childrens hospitals in Europe. they have multiple charity drives each year, which includes a comedy show they have yearly on tv to get donations.

So whenever you hear "my donations will go to ST. Jude" be weary.

Also when you see a lowball number (yes I believe 1 and 10 k are low in this situation) then be extra vigilant. why you may ask easy.

This is a psychological trick,  a cognitive bias called “price anchoring” described by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman if you’ve ever read the book Thinking Fast Thinking Slow.

“Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias where an individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of information offered to make subsequent judgments during decision making. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor.”

Often a tactic used in pricing goods or negotiation.

Classical conditioning sets you in a specific mindset, like pavlov had with the dogs. you hear a bell and you start salivating because you know hey it's food time.

Same go's if someone says hey 1k is the goal over and over, you start to believe that.

So from this point on if someone posts a low ball 1/10k "My GaIn$ wIlL Go To X when 1/10k" I'll just delete these threads because they're bullshit, 1k is the minimum this stock was thought to do by both Ryan Cohen and RC Ventures and Domo Capital.

**1K IS NOT A SQUEEZE!**

thanks to  u/ellosee for pointing out the "price Anchoring"

Don't over focus on what they're doing, expect fuckery, but keep your eye on the prize people.

focus on your moon, on all that heavenly glory, and let it bring you calm that we have slowly but surely been gaining momentum once more.

These guys will run out of money at some point, if the DTCC rule kicks in and they're still in this they are most likely fucked. as the DTCC can say "pay up bitch" and they're done within a week.

Don't expect the HF who oppose us to give up, they'll fight you to their very last breath however they can. but know we are currently at the time of writing on 242 euro thats $288 USD. again going up massively. we may be moving slow, but we are moving.
