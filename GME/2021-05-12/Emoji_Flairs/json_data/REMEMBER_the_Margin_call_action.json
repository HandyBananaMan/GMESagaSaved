    "selftext": "Apes. I\u2019ve seen so much confirmation bias over the last 48 hours, particularly from GameStop tweets. I see the VIX is now 27.59! CNBC talking margin calls by end of trading, and of course our very own time traveller DFV tweet. \n\nTime to remind everyone to just take a deep breath and just remember what we need to do to see numbers we only see in our dreams!!! \n\nIt\u2019s simple my fellow Apes...when the squeeze starts, HOLD. FFS HOLD. If you get excited and paper hand on the way up, it slows it down, the SHF cover and and we ALL suffer. We won\u2019t achieve the MOASS. \n\nSell on the way down, over the peak. If your wondering where that will be...no one knows. But what I can tell you is if you HOLD, you will see numbers that will make you realise you never actually knew what jacked tits felt like, you just thought you did!!! \n\nFinally...it\u2019s not just Shitadel in the game. There are probably dozens of SHF\u2019s fucked, and in okay. They all have to grab a stop early doors. No one wants to be last in paying $1M a share or whatever your floor!!! \n\nGame on Apes. This is what we have been waiting for. Find your nerve and let\u2019s not let these fucks get off lightly, know what I\u2019m saying!!!! \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
