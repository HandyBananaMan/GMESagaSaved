<ul>
<li>Good Morning/Night 🦍 s, everyday is a day closer to THE MOASS to end all MOASSes🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (Sorry about the automod hick ups over the last 2 days, ive been tinkering with it to help clean up the Spam/Forum Sliding, it should be all good now, also feel free to tag me for content that doesn't belong).</li>
<li>Let's start with some recent news about some of Shitedals subsidiaries selling <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/no3irh/citadel_tactical_trading_total_amount_sold_is/gzya5n7?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">28 Billion worth of shares</a>, on top of that an 🦍 Noticed buys are no longer going exclusively through a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nq52qf/execution_venues_normalization_an_indicator_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Shitedal Dark (CDED)</a>, Shitedal Dark? really 😂🤣, you cant make this shit up 🦍s, and to add some extra confirmation bias here's another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nr1smd/daily_reverse_repo_20210602/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">increase in the reverse repo rate</a></li>
<li>🦍s here's some older but intresting options updates, there's 450,000 shares in 800+ calls costing 4 Milly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn3jjf/has_anyone_noticed_that_4500_of_the_gamestop_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">expiring on July 16th</a>, there doesn't seem to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nmp1j7/no_deep_itm_calls_have_been_purchased_all_week/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">anymore Deep ITM calls</a>, both seem to be bullish indicators 🤔, and to top that off it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn1ubu/ally_blocking_purchases_of_contracts_above_490c/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">looks like Allys blocking calls above 490 for retail</a>, im feeling 🦍ish 😤.</li>
<li>🦍s have talked about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m320j9/its_a_sign_gme_and_slgg/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">potential SLGG merge</a> before, so heres another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nqy4vt/prediction_slgg_and_gme_are_going_to_merge/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">loose/ tin foil hat theory</a>, the first one that started this was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mqcjp5/rcs_tweet_tagged_him_at_culver_city_gamestop14/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">RC near the SLGG headquarters</a>, gonna be interesting if that's what RC meant by the tombstone tweet 👀.</li>
<li>i also have to issue a correction about the cusp# causing recall as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nomalf/dr_trimbaths_work_directly_disproves_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Cusp# may not assist 🦍s.</a>, either way RCs got that Crypto/NFT move as well to force Hedgies covering and it looks like a merger is still something that may happen (tombstone tweet and the SLGG hypothesis above)</li>
<li>what's really intresting is this from <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/">the article</a>  <em>"By DiIorio’s reckoning, then, the cycle of naked shorting and reverse splits would inevitably result in an ever-increasing number of aged fails. And if that was happening, and those liabilities grew bigger and bigger, then federal regulators could see the outlines of the scheme on any financial statement."</em> that last line very interesting 👀 considering they can't afford to keep shorting GME now (remember the reverse repo market/Hyperinflation Shitedlas Illegal Money Short Printer is causing). it will be intresting for 🦍s to see how this pans out 💎🙌</li>
<li>Here's some information on the AMC FOMO creation happening (i felt i should address some of this since the subs constantly being hit with AMC comments/posts) an 🦍 posted up the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nqxzb2/gme_v_amc_today_6221/h0dj6yz?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">gains comparison on volume</a>, they are even pushing AMC on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/npx2wm/shills_are_not_even_trying_anymore/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">GME ticker searches</a>, even an 🦍 is smelling something fishy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/npycqn/so_my_broker_trade_republik_thinks_i_need_to_know/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">when even the broker starts pushing it</a>. If you need another reminders that GME is special, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/npx017/obv_on_balance_volume_just_went_to_142_billion/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">OBV is 142 Billion</a> 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</li>
<li>Also in case you haven't heard <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/no8tap/dip_machine_broken_but_tits_jacking_machine_is_at/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">the Dip Machines broken</a>, all of this together shows they are using FOMO to buy more time for GME 🚀, imagine if that FOMO pressure from Gamestop Tweets, RC tweets, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nqmioj/holy_fuck_tits_jacked/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">DFV Tweeting again</a>, was put into GME, into the MOASSOAT where would 🚀 be? (Disclaimer: im not saying AMC won't Squeeze im saying it isn't GME, im still 💎🙌ing AMC from January, but GME is the last Squeeze to be sqoozed)</li>
<li>Moving back onto what this Subs about we have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nr1m9x/just_so_everyone_is_aware_2_meetings_on_the_9rh/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">GME Investor Meetings</a> coming up, make sure to check out gamestops website <a href="https://news.gamestop.com">https://news.gamestop.com</a> , there's some good news to talk about for the meeting about gamestops impact on the world, it looks like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nqlt7m/a_third_of_teens_say_they_are_learning_financial/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">1/6 of teens are now learning about finances</a> because of 💎🙌🦍s and Gamestop 🍗🍗.</li>
