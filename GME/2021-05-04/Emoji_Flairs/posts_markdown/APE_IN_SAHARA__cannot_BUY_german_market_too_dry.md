Hi retards,

Instructions are clear, buy and hold but I cannot BUY on the german market today.

I have 3 pending orders with limits at 136‚Ç¨, 137 and 139 (ATM 135,86) since 45 minutes. Dry as Sahara!

**edit 1:17pm (GMT+2)** \- orders went through, took 1h10 to execute

**update 9:28pm** \- broker is DEGIRO, I have both GME and G2SC (GameStop ticker on german exchange XETRA - Deutsche B√∂rse) and the only place of execution is FRAB.

And since this post gain some traction:

* I will buy tomorrow and post the result here
* I will make a post and the different places of execution on NYSE

Oh, and btw I am a  üá´üá∑ ü•ñ üç∑ü¶ç but spend one year in Germany, love you guys!

**update 11:29** \- broker's UI indicates a trading volume of 1 797 today on XETRA

**update 5 May** \- bought another share on the german market, order went through in less than a minute. Same in the US market.
