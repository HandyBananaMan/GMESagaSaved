    "selftext": "I'm not going to lie. It's been a rough couple of months after diving into all the amazing DD that was put out here on reddit. \n\nOnce my eyes were opened to the rampant manipulation going on behind the curtains I couldn't wait to discuss with all my friends and family. Instead, I was met with laughter and dismissive comments. No matter what I pointed to or referenced to... no one took me seriously. No one even gave it a couple of minutes to read and look through. My wife as supportive as she isn't interested in what's going on and is sick of me talking about it. \n\nSo to say I've been a little lonely is an understatement. But when I look through GME and Superstonk I feel like I'm a part of something. I feel like I have all of you by my side with me in this battle. I'm grateful for all the wrinkly brain Apes and smooth brain Apes. The DD, memes, reasons for holding, and all the sleuthing that everyone does. I love it all and it's what gets me through the day. \n\nSo thank you. To DFV, all you Apes, Ryan Cohen and Gamestop. \n\nThese Hedge Funds deserve whats coming to them.\nI'll see you on the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nEdit: The support is overwhelming! I tried replying to you all but this blew up. Much love to you all. Even the detractors.\nOne last thing. Remember, it's the bond we created here that's been able to shield us from the FUD and lead this world towards a fair sense of justice. These HFs carry the richest of the rich and the smartest ivy leaguers out here. Don't think for one second that the love we have for each other is \"weird and cultish\". Without it we would crumble beneath these greedy giants.",
