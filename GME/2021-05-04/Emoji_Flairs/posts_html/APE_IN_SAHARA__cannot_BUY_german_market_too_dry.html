<p>Hi retards,</p>
<p>Instructions are clear, buy and hold but I cannot BUY on the german market today.</p>
<p>I have 3 pending orders with limits at 136€, 137 and 139 (ATM 135,86) since 45 minutes. Dry as Sahara!</p>

<p><strong>edit 1:17pm (GMT+2)</strong> - orders went through, took 1h10 to execute</p>
<p><strong>update 9:28pm</strong> - broker is DEGIRO, I have both GME and G2SC (GameStop ticker on german exchange XETRA - Deutsche Börse) and the only place of execution is FRAB.</p>
<p>And since this post gain some traction:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will buy tomorrow and post the result here</li>
<li>I will make a post and the different places of execution on NYSE</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>update 11:29</strong> - broker's UI indicates a trading volume of 1 797 today on XETRA</p>
<p><strong>update 5 May</strong> - bought another share on the german market, order went through in less than a minute. Same in the US market.</p>
