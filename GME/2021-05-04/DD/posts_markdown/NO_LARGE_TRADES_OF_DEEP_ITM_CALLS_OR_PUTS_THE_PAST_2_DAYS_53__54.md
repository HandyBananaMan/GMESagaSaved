What up Apes,

u/Dan_Bren here wanted to apologize for the lack of posts been super busy but wanted to get the data out for everyone who's been asking. We didn't see any large block trades of DEEP ITM calls or puts the past 2 days. I will continue to monitor how the rest of the week plays out (data below)

Disregard the time in the images as I had pulled them after midnight which is why they are showing the next date.

See ya tomorrow
