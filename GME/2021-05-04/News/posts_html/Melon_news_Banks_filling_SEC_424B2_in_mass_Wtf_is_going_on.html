<p>Check what a form 424B2 is here‚Ä¶</p>
<p>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-424b2.asp</p>
<p>I need wrinkle brains to be in this please, this suppose to be prior filling and IPO?? Is this a common practice?</p>
<p>But also, he‚Äôs common standard practice, but does anyone have a look what is inside those? I would love to see if some or many of them maybe have a portion or a lot of maybe Naked shares inside??? Maybe some juicy GMEs?</p>
<p>People in the comments say that is an standard practice because it‚Äôs been happening for a while constantly‚Ä¶. Seem like long time fuckery to me. But I‚Äôm just a pessimist :P</p>
<p>Might be just nothing, you decide </p>

<p><strong>A smart ape said this in the comments</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúGood call... there were all those 0% interest bonds being issued today that expire/mature in 4 weeks time on 1st June. Someone speculated that they‚Äôre good to have in the event of a market crash.</p>
<p>But I‚Äôm a smooth brain so don‚Äôt get it!‚Äù</p>
<p>This could be related https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n19kgr/zerocoupon_bonds/</p>
<p>If they are going for the 0% bonds seems to me they are taking advantage of Libor for as much as they can until SOFR comes and bite them in the bum. </p>
<p>Apparently this bonds can default and be worthless if the bank bankrupt.
