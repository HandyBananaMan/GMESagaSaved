Is this a common practice?\n\nBut also, he\u2019s common standard practice, but does anyone have a look what is inside those? I would love to see if some or many of them maybe have a portion or a lot of maybe Naked shares inside??? Maybe some juicy GMEs?\n\nPeople in the comments say that is an standard practice because it\u2019s been happening for a while constantly\u2026. Seem like long time fuckery to me. But I\u2019m just a pessimist :P\n\nMight be just nothing, you decide \n\nhttps://sec.report/Form/424B2\n\n**A smart ape said this in the comments**\n\n\u201cGood call... there were all those 0% interest bonds being issued today that expire/mature in 4 weeks time on 1st June. Someone speculated that they\u2019re good to have in the event of a market crash.\n\nBut I\u2019m a smooth brain so don\u2019t get it!\u201d\n\nThis could be related https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n19kgr/zerocoupon_bonds/\n\nIf they are going for the 0% bonds seems to me they are taking advantage of Libor for as much as they can until SOFR comes and bite them in the bum. \n\nApparently this bonds can default and be worthless if the bank bankrupt.\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/fixed-income-bonds/when-bonds-go-bad\n\n\nSo far I\u2019ve counted 420 fillings and all by major banks.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/MxgdgRW\n\nLet\u2019s poke this and I\u2019ll keep updates!\n\nLove you all!!\n\n\ud83c\udf49\n\nEdit: another 20 dumped \n\nEdit 2: they might be buying bonds with 0% interest to prepare for a market crash, confirmation?\n\nEdit 3: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/fixed-income-bonds/when-bonds-go-bad\n\nNo financial advice, a melon lying on the sun!\n\nEdit: **new FUD strat is to try and deflect the real problem with some antisemic and \u201csocial issues\u201d FUD**. \n\n**But don\u2019t let that FUD get you out of focus, apes are here because apes like the stock, apes don\u2019t like to be manipulated and scammed!!!**",
