Check what a form 424B2 is here‚Ä¶

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-424b2.asp

I need wrinkle brains to be in this please, this suppose to be prior filling and IPO?? Is this a common practice?

But also, he‚Äôs common standard practice, but does anyone have a look what is inside those? I would love to see if some or many of them maybe have a portion or a lot of maybe Naked shares inside??? Maybe some juicy GMEs?

People in the comments say that is an standard practice because it‚Äôs been happening for a while constantly‚Ä¶. Seem like long time fuckery to me. But I‚Äôm just a pessimist :P

Might be just nothing, you decide

**A smart ape said this in the comments**

‚ÄúGood call... there were all those 0% interest bonds being issued today that expire/mature in 4 weeks time on 1st June. Someone speculated that they‚Äôre good to have in the event of a market crash.

But I‚Äôm a smooth brain so don‚Äôt get it!‚Äù

If they are going for the 0% bonds seems to me they are taking advantage of Libor for as much as they can until SOFR comes and bite them in the bum. 

Apparently this bonds can default and be worthless if the bank bankrupt.

Edit: another 20 dumped 

Edit 2: they might be buying bonds with 0% interest to prepare for a market crash, confirmation?

No financial advice, a melon lying on the sun!
