<p>Hate short sellers from ripping off investors &amp; markets? Us too. That's why we're releasing (early to Reddit!) a Fact Sheet w/ 10 recommendations for the SEC to stop them from doing that - read it here: <a href="https://bettermarkets.com/sites/default/files/Short%20Selling%20-%2010%20Recommendations%20for%20Improving%20the%20SEC%E2%80%99s%20Regulatory%20Framework.pdf">https://bettermarkets.com/sites/default/files/Short%20Selling%20-%2010%20Recommendations%20for%20Improving%20the%20SEC%E2%80%99s%20Regulatory%20Framework.pdf</a>.  The SEC Chair is testifying Thursday at the House Financial Services Committee hearing &amp; we're going to push for him to be questioned about this &amp; lots of other issues re GME, Robinhood, retail traders, Citadel, high frequency trading, etc. We will also be live tweeting the hearing @bettermarkets - join us for what should be an important discussion of issues that directly impact retail traders and the markets.</p>
