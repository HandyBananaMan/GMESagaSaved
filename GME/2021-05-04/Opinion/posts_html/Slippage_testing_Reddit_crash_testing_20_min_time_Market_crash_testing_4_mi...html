<p>Looks like HF are preparing for end game.</p>
<ol>
<li>testing slippage using large candles.</li>
<li>Testing social media down time to see how quickly Team restore them and how much time they have, looks like reddit was down for 20 minutes, so HF got 20 minutes, that seems too low.</li>
<li>Testing how quickly they can drop the market before it recovers, looks like today in 4 minutes they were able to crash most of tech stock pretty large, before it recovers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this week is test run for them, seems like end game is near next week or month so.</p>
<p>Edit1: u/manoylo_vnc told that FB was down too today.</p>
<p>Not  a financial advice.</p>
