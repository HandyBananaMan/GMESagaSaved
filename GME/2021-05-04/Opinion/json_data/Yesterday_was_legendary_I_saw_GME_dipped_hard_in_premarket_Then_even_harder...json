    "title": "Yesterday was legendary. I saw GME dipped hard in premarket. Then even harder during the 1st 30 minutes of trading. I got ready to buy the dip and thought we will see $140. The $150 resistance held and we bounced back to past $160!! I\u2019m so proud of everyone. We will dine like kings!!",
