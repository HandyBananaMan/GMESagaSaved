Here's some more useful information with logic of [doubling your floor for taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nod5c9/floor_after_taxes/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and some math using fidelities 500% increase limit above share price showcasing how quickly [the price could move](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnbqqj/from_512_to_1000000000_in_ten_steps_using/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (Market Halts not included) and here's an excellent explanation of a Margin Call, and [how covering isn't immediate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn6g4r/understanding_the_margin_call_why_it_does_not/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), \ud83e\udd8ds already know what's up as far as waiting for Hedgies to pay (\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c)\n* \ud83e\udd8ds another friendly reminder that Kenny [isn't playing fair](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn5lnl/well_someone_doesnt_want_it_going_past_230_again/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and thats not the only thing to worry about. There have been a few posts about How [Hedgies Infiltrate, and spread misinformation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mulstf/cointelpro_techniques_for_dilution_misdirection/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), here's a [social media company Kenny uses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmacz0/the_social_media_war_its_time_for_ape_boot_camp/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to control his false narratives. There isn't just shills but [scammers](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnjrhq/g_m_e/gzuydmg?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) as well so remember to [protect your accounts/information](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/no5hjg/secure_your_accounts_before_moass/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n* To end on a good note here's another hedgie is going down from 700 million to [250 million in assets](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nn9zca/the_renaissance_period_ends_aka_another_hedge/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) dropping like a rock, [Protecting Gamestop jobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nnxz1e/remember_ken_griffin_still_wants_to_wipe_out_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is another benefit of HODLing \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c and to close a little Meme/Premarket [Hype Video](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/no9m4r/a_little_premarked_hype_video_i_put_together/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).
