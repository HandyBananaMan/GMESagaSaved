Even better \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7 Edit: Not that I would sell under $20\u2018000\u2018000 anyways.\n\nI understand that some may think this is FUD because of the blocking of the shares but for me, the more important part was: **The broker confirmed that more shares were sold than are available**\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSwissquote is my broker and I wanted to verify, that the corporate action that I executed yesterday evening has gone through. After voting, I saw that the shares were blocked so I asked until when will the shares be blocked: \n\nCustomer Rep: **They will be blocked until after the annual shareholder meeting.** (Edit: Only the shares that are eligible for the vote are blocked, I can still buy/sell in general)\n\nSo I asked: Why do they have been blocked? \n\nCustomer Rep: **Well, there is currently a dilemma, that more shares were sold than there are available.**\n\n\nNever have I been more Zen \ud83d\ude0e\n\nEdit: After the eToro history yesterday evening, I take it with a grain of salt but still :)\n\nEdit2: \n[Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/3s7U30h)\n\nEdit3: https://www.swissquote.ch/sqw-static/project-resources/pdf/tutorials/swissquote-eTrading-Platform_de.pdf Page 40: It seems normal that for a voluntary corporate action, shares can be blocked.",
