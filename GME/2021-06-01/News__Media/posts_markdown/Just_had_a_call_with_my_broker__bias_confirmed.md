**LATEST UPDATE**: The shares are unblocked again after checking. Even better 💎🦍🦧 Edit: Not that I would sell under $20‘000‘000 anyways.

I understand that some may think this is FUD because of the blocking of the shares but for me, the more important part was: **The broker confirmed that more shares were sold than are available**


———

Swissquote is my broker and I wanted to verify, that the corporate action that I executed yesterday evening has gone through. After voting, I saw that the shares were blocked so I asked until when will the shares be blocked: 

Customer Rep: **They will be blocked until after the annual shareholder meeting.** (Edit: Only the shares that are eligible for the vote are blocked, I can still buy/sell in general)

So I asked: Why do they have been blocked? 

Customer Rep: **Well, there is currently a dilemma, that more shares were sold than there are available.**


Never have I been more Zen 😎

Edit: After the eToro history yesterday evening, I take it with a grain of salt but still :)

Edit3: https://www.swissquote.ch/sqw-static/project-resources/pdf/tutorials/swissquote-eTrading-Platform_de.pdf Page 40: It seems normal that for a voluntary corporate action, shares can be blocked.
