Hear ye! The squeeze has not squoze! We know this. In fact, having read all of the DD on this sub it seems clear that none of the hedgies have covered and so far all we're really seeing is the positive price movement caused by apes all over the world reading all of the posts by u/atobitt and others and, at the very least, looking at all of the nice crayon drawings on here or, at the very verrry least watching someone stick a banana up their bum and deciding that was a good enough reason to buy a stonk. \n\n\nKnowing that January truly was not a squeeze,  I therefor propose that we refer to it as The Sneeze henceforth so there can be no confusion once the moass cometh.\n\nEDIT: well I didn't have enough karma for a superstonk post but I sure do now so... cross-posted.   Cheers \ud83c\udf7b apes! Also never received awards before so double cheers to that!",
