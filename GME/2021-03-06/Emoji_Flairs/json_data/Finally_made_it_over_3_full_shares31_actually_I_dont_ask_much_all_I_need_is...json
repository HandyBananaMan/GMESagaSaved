I am a single father of two beautiful girls, and let's just say both of their mothers are not in the picture, so it is all on me. And coincidentally enough both of my daughters love tendies.......\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 So let's just say that works out just fine.\n\n\nMe stand behind brother and sister \ud83e\udd8d's.
