<p>I may not be wealthy, and just barely scraping by, but I know we are stronger together. Only thing I care about is putting a little extra food on my two daughters plates. I am a single father of two beautiful girls, and let's just say both of their mothers are not in the picture, so it is all on me. And coincidentally enough both of my daughters love tendies.......😂🤣 So let's just say that works out just fine.</p>
