<p><strong>Not financial advice, I’m not an expert, just using the publicly available information I can obtain.</strong> </p>
<p>This DD is in reply to u/thadaaaay and all those sceptical of 500K, get ready folks cause I’m want to chew crayons and kick ass, and I’m all out of ass. </p>
<p>Let’s say that every single ape, wife, boyfriend, whale and institution is a true diamond hand and holds to 500K </p>
<p>The float of trade-able shares is 45.16M. </p>
<p>45.16M X 500K = 22,580,000,000,000 or 22.58 trillion. Woah, that seems like a big number, right? It’s about a trillion more than the USA’s 2019 GDP. </p>
<p>Before we begin, this is a work in progress as I learn more information and am informed of corrections that are needed to this DD. Please critique where I’ve made errors and offer further information if you can find it. </p>
<p>I also apologise for formatting errors to pc and mobile apes. </p>

<p><strong>SHORTER PORTFOLIO VALUES</strong> </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the value of portfolio assets our opponents have against us. This is based on the most recent data I could find, thanks to u/skifunkster - </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>
<p>If anyone has newer data than this we could get a more accurate position. The value of these companies will also have likely decreased since this post due to the red we’ve been seeing in the market. Their value in the face of a squeeze would also further decrease due to there being a high chance of a massive market wide sell off occurring as they scramble to liquidate their assets. </p>
<p>All of this information is from the 31st of December, filed in February. And is sourced from the Fintel 13F filings unless other sources are provided </p>
<p>So, we have good ol’ Melvin - </p>
<p>22.64 Billion</p>
<p>(We can expect this to have dropped to around 8+ billion after their estimated 53% loss, cash infusion and 20% February increase, reports on asset value, January loss and February gain variate wildly though, so if anyone can give a more accurate reading that would be great. An ADV form I found states 13.1 Billion AUM as of February 1st.) <a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp</a></p>
<p>Susquehanna International Group, LLP-</p>
<p>612.15 Billion</p>
<p>UBS Group AG- </p>
<p>u/skifunkster 295.785 Billion, if you could explain where you got your numbers from that would be appreciated. I found a market cap value of \~56 Billion, but a total asset value of 1.065 TRILLION as of June 2020. <a href="https://www.advratings.com/companies/ubs-group">https://www.advratings.com/companies/ubs-group</a></p>
<p>Group One Trading L.p.-</p>
<p>57.81 Billion </p>
<p>Shitadel Advisors LLC- </p>
<p>384.6 Billion</p>
<p>Citigroup Inc-</p>
<p>169.392 Billion</p>
<p>Wolverine trading Llc-</p>
<p>64.05 Billion (I believe there is an error on the Fintel 13F as it shows Wolverine Trading only managing 0.64 Billion, a 99% loss over 3 months. Other sources seem to confirm 64 Billion is the correct value.) </p>
<p>Maplelane Capital Llc-</p>
<p>7.36 Billion </p>
<p>So let’s remember these companies all have more than 100% exposure to their positions as the maximum price of a share during a 100%+ Short interest short squeeze is theoretically infinite. </p>
<p>So if everyone held for 500K, giving GameStop a total float value of 22.58 Trillion, the Shorters would be able to cover...</p>
<p>\~1.36 Trillion at minimum, and \~ 2.384 trillion at maximum, if they liquidated all assets. </p>
<p>This would still leave us with 21.22 trillion at most, and 20.196 trillion left to be paid out to all us diamond hands. So who’s going to pay? </p>
<p>———————————————————————------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>SHORTER TOTAL ASSETS</strong> </p>
<p>These hedgefunds and institutions don’t have to disclose the amount of liquid cash they own, which when added to their portfolio value gives their true Assets Under Management. </p>
<p>This data is harder to find, most sources are from whalewisdom.com and is about a year out of date. </p>
<p>Good ol’ Melvin- Appears to have between 0.6 Billion and 5.1Billion dollars in cash, I cannot find a definitive source however, I’m just estimating off of various reports, so the value could be less or more. </p>
<p>Susquehanna- Could not find an AUM. </p>
<p>UBS- AUM 3.5 TRILLION according to <a href="https://www.advratings.com/companies/ubs-group">https://www.advratings.com/companies/ubs-group</a> </p>
<p>As of June 2020. </p>
<p>Group One Trading- Could not find an AUM. </p>
<p>Shitadel- Has not filed an AUM since the 28th of May 2020 </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc- The third largest US bank, has according to ADV ratings, 2.2 trillion in assets, as of March 2020. Their Global Consumer Bank division had 145 Billion AUM as of March 2020, which I believe is the value u/skifunkster and I found. However, Citigroup’s Institutional Client Group has \~19 TRILLION in assets under custody. <a href="https://www.advratings.com/reviews/citigroup">Citigroup Inc - Assets under Management (AUM) 2020</a></p>
<p>Wolverine Trading Llc- Cannot find AUM.</p>
<p>(Another HF, Wolverine Asset Management, is very similarly named but appears to be a un-affiliated company, might be worth looking in to.) </p>
<p>Maplelane Capital- AUM as of March 2020 of 3.758 Billion. Apparently lost 33% during January mini squeeze. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-maplelane-loses-about-33-on-short-bets-this-month">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-maplelane-loses-about-33-on-short-bets-this-month </a></p>
<p>Unless they had a 100% return in 2020, which I can’t find evidence of, they appear to have at least 50% of their assets on margin from their prime broker. </p>
<p>...so, what does this mean? </p>
<p>None of the hedge funds are required to state their total assets under management, just portfolio value. However the banks Citigroup and UBS have publicly available AUM’s. </p>
<p>Our 21.22/20.196 Trillion now becomes 18.72/ 17.696 with the additional 2.5 Trillion UBS can cough up. </p>
<p>When we add Citigroup, with between 2 and 19 Trillion dollars under management, our outstanding cost goes down to between a minimum of 16.72/15.696, and -0.28 and -1.304! If Citigroup completely liquidated and went bankrupt, they could pay off almost the entirety of the 22.58 Trillion we want just by themselves. </p>
<p>However these are just gross numbers, and I’m not sure on whether these banks would be able to legally protect certain sums from exposure. Nor does this include the cash the hedge funds have available as its not legally required for them to report this as far as I’m aware. </p>
<p>———————————————————————------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>PRIME BROKERS</strong> </p>
<p>We haven’t even got to the people who finance our hedge funds- Prime Brokers. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://docs.preqin.com/reports/Hedge-Fund-Prime-Brokers-June-2018.pdf">https://docs.preqin.com/reports/Hedge-Fund-Prime-Brokers-June-2018.pdf</a></p>
<p>These are the main prime brokers of hedgefunds as of May 2018. </p>
<p>We’re most interested in figure 3, which shows who services(haha) the big boys, and as we can see in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the big three are </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs- </p>
<p>1.163 Trillion total assets <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GS/goldman-sachs/total-assets">Goldman Sachs Total Assets 2006-2020 | GS | MacroTrends</a> as of December 2020, with Wikipedia and google estimating 2.145 trillion AUM. They are SHITADEL’S prime broker. <a href="https://www.thetradenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pbSurvey.pdf">https://www.thetradenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pbSurvey.pdf</a></p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Prime Brokerage- Could not find the brokerage division value, didn’t want to use their general value as I’m not sure if the rest of the corporation is liable to payout. (Anyone who understands the legal aspect of this can chip in.) </p>
<p>J.P. Morgan- $0.5 billion in prime brokerage balances <a href="https://www.thetradenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pbSurvey.pdf">https://www.thetradenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pbSurvey.pdf</a> </p>
<p>So we can see who the big players are, and our likely culprits. When a short seller defaults on their short buy backs their broker is liable for any remaining exposure. I cannot find any information stating this is otherwise for when a hedge fund fails to fulfil their obligation to return the shares due to insolvency, so I will take this assumption and carry on with the line of thinking that the prime brokers will be liable for the remaining exposure. (This is a completely new scenario as far as I’m aware, so, if someone can confirm this for everyone it would be great.) </p>
<p>So taking just the top three prime broker AUM’s , there is an additional minimum of 1.663 to 2.645 trillion available to pay for 500K per share. </p>
<p>So if UBS and Citigroup were able to protect their combined 21.5 trillion from exposure, our total remaining to for 500K would be no longer 21.22/20.196 but at least 19.557/18.575 or to 18.553/17.551. </p>
<p>If anyone can find out who the prime brokers for each short sellers is that would give us a lot more information. </p>

<p>The DTCC</p>
<p>This is when we get to the good stuff, and our gains become ‘too big to fail’.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8yYiC75vvAhXTasAKHYGGBBIQFjALegQILxAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dtcc.com%2F~%2Fmedia%2FFiles%2FDownloads%2Flegal%2Frules%2Fnscc_rules.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0avQW3P4BRlgzpomtYOld0">RULES &amp; PROCEDURES - DTCCwww.dtcc.com › Downloads › legal › rules › nscc_rules</a></p>
<p>From SEC 4, RULE 4 of the NSCC rules-</p>
<p>“Each Member shall be obligated to the Corporation for the entire amount of any loss or liability incurred by the Corporation arising out of or relating to any Defaulting Member Event with respect to such Member. To the extent that such loss or liability is not satisfied pursuant to Section 3 of this Rule 4, the Corporation shall apply a Corporate Contribution thereto and charge the remaining amount of such loss or liability ratably to other Members, as further provided below. </p>
<p>The Corporation shall apply the Corporate Contribution to losses and liabilities that arise out of or relate to one or more Defaulting Member Events and/or Declared Non-Default Loss Events that occur within an Event Period. If losses and liabilities with respect to such Event Period remain unsatisfied following application of the Corporate Contribution, the Corporation shall allocate such losses and liabilities to Members, subject to the requirements and limitations below. </p>
<p>Each Member that is a Member on the first day of an Event Period shall be obligated to pay its pro rata share of losses and liabilities arising out of or relating to each Defaulting Member Event” </p>
<p>What I understand this to mean is that when the DTCC has to payout for a loss, (say when the prime broker of a short squeezed hedge fund defaults) Every single member of the DTCC has to pay a proportionate rate of that loss. </p>
<p>The DTCC is composed of the DTC and the NSCC, through which virtually all broker to broker and custodian bank transactions occur. Therefore unless someone can provide evidence otherwise, I will go forward with the assumption that all the exposure to the Short Squeeze will fall onto the DTCC and its 4000+ members. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.selectusa.gov/financial-services-industry-united-states">https://www.selectusa.gov/financial-services-industry-united-states</a> The financial service industry amounted to $1.5 Trillion of the USA’s 2018 GDP.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/421737/bank-assets-usa/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/421737/bank-assets-usa/</a> The banking sector had 24.05 Trillion under assets in 2019. </p>
<p>Even if somehow enough capital could not be raised, the DTC keeps around 3.5 million security issues available worth up to $40 Trillion. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the DTC is part of the federal reserve system, which brings us onto our last point. </p>
<p>——————————————————————————————--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>The Federal Reserve System</strong> </p>
<p>Ah, Papa Powell and his money printer. </p>
<p>I hope that it’s now apparent how large the quantity of wealth in just a small section of the world economy is. And yet at the end of the day, when all else fails, the Fed can just print our tendies. </p>
<p>35% of all U.S Dollars have been printed in the last 12 months, almost 2.4 trillion. When Biden passes his bill that will almost double. </p>
<p><img alt="https://preview.redd.it/rxuo34jiqd561.jpg?width=1610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e096a718cda81fbc7ac4ecf161fe2ea3d7d55b2" src="https://preview.redd.it/rxuo34jiqd561.jpg?width=1610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e096a718cda81fbc7ac4ecf161fe2ea3d7d55b2" /> </p>
<p>Printing this quantity of money will likely cause massive inflation so printing some more to buy our shares won’t make much difference, especially when the alternative is a loss of faith in the markets. After the hedgefunds, banks, prime brokers, and DTCC have all ran out of cash, (which would be nigh on impossible by my estimates,) the fed could just simply print money to keep the DTCC solvent. There would likely be bail outs, but we’d be rich beyond our wildest dreams, and the new SEC chief seems currently to be prepared to take a hard stance against hedge funds. </p>
<p>Have I convinced you that 500K is possible and wouldn’t even put much of a dent in the financial markets? Yes? Well let me make this even more appealing. </p>
<p>NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO SELL AT 500K.</p>
<p>There will be paper hands at 1K, 10K, &gt;100K. There will be those that sell at 100K to 200K, 300K to 400K, and there will be those that sell at 500K+. I could see seven figures being reached. </p>
<p>This is because of the probability of distribution. I’m not claiming to be an expert statistician here, or even a good one, my knowledge of statistics is up to a UK A level, or an AP exam for American apes. Therefore any actual statisticians who can choose a more valid model would be much appreciated. </p>
<p>In addition, human emotions play a large role in making the stock market an unpredictable beast who cannot regularly be modelled. This is also the reason however, that not everyone will sell at 500K. </p>
<p>The normal distribution, or bell shaped curve- </p>
<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/zuk9x4pqofl61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c36107e25bab2a5167c3d092bbf9283c49c7e1e</p>
<p>This model is for IQ but we can use it for reference, as you can see with the normal distribution, the majority(68.2%) would sell within one standard deviation of the most common price. Then almost everyone would sell within two standard deviations of the price and all but 0.3% of people within three standard deviations. What the most common price and the value of deviation would be during the squeeze is unknown to us, as there is no data relevant to this scenario we can draw upon. However if the Squeeze was to follow a standard deviation, not every share would be sold for 500K. </p>
<p>I don’t think the normal distribution is the correct model to use, and if any wrinkle brained apes can choose a better model that would be great. Here’s a list of other model- </p>
<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/a5mxkycsofl61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1e358965eb973f8a344f4f89f59d5034091c5e6</p>
<p>In none of these models is there a tight distribution, other than perhaps the Bernoulli, where the values are at the equal at the extremes, which doesn’t really follow the chaotic nature of trading. Its been too long since I learnt about binomial distribution to even attempt to apply it, but a binomial, chi-squared, beta or gamma(Gamma squeeze, get it?) would be my completely uneducated guesses on what a normal distribution would look like. </p>
<p>I can’t really see how to apply these models to the squeeze, as there is no data or point of reference. An inverted normal distribution with a U-shaped curve could be another model, with paper hands selling off early, the price sky rocketing and then diamond hands taking their profits. Even if the models cannot be used scientifically, their principles can be, WE DON’T NEED 500K X THE FLOAT, or EVEN 1 MILLION X THE FLOAT, AS PEOPLE WILL PAPER HAND EARLY. </p>
<p>I’m tired, probably made mistakes, work in progress. I wanted to show that there was enough cash in the financial dominos that we could knock them over for 500K+, does that make sense? Probably not. </p>
<p>TL;DR read it. No? Fine- 500K is easily affordable, and it doesn’t matter what the total valuation of the company is, because fundamentals have gone out the window AND not every share will be sold at the peak, not even close, that’s what causes the squeeze, the hedge funds buying in as paper hands sell.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress, apes sharing info makes us strong. REMEMBER nothing is guaranteed, but I agree with the maths that has been done and the information we have found.</p>
<p>Edit- </p>
<p>Question: what would happen if institutions sold under us? </p>
<p>My response: </p>
<p>Great question, according to Yahoo finance, institutional ownership is at 122.04% of the float. From my current understanding the additional 22.04% of ownership comes from naked shorting artificially increasing the stocks supply. This doesn’t even take into consideration the fact retail controls a significant chunk of GME, being the most traded stock in most of Europe and also the most traded in January on RobinHood etc. </p>
<p>The short% of float according to Yahoo finance is 60.35% not including GME shorted in ETFs like XRT. There has been some DD done calculating short% up to and over 400%, I believe it’s in the God Tier DD thread. This would make institutions a significant but not dominant group on being able to supply the demand of shares. We don’t know when they are planning on selling, but as a public forum they can see our general sentiment. It’s all a guessing game, without more information, and only time will tell what will happen. The advantage of massively undercutting retail doesn’t seem that beneficial, as the main principle of the short squeeze thesis is that they must cover all shares. Therefore the institutions would be cutting out their profit for no conceivable gain other than to stick it to retail. That’s just my opinion. A large institutional sell off would cause a sell wall, but the act of Hedgies buying the shares should up the price as there exposure and demand outweighs the number of shares institutions have available to sell. Once the institutions exit their positions the price should then continue to go up as the hedgies according to our current information as they require all the shares and more. </p>
<p>That was a ramble but just my thoughts based on what we know, still available to critique.</p>
