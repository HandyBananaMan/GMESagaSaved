Long time lurker and holder of gme.($cum 80@$120)\n\nCredit goes to u/LongTermTendieLoser for this find. \nMy smooth brain doesnt understand all of it but apparently the dtcc is going to require daily payment instead of at the end of an option as well as implement it within 10 days of submitting.\n Can I get someone with a wrinkle to elaborate further? \n https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf\n\nEdit: thanks for your replies and helping paint a clearer picture!
