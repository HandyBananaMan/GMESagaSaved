    "selftext": "I don\u2019t know about the rest of y\u2019all, but I never saw the appeal or logic in getting super flashy cars or a giant mansion simply because one can. That is fine for some but just not for me. I never saw myself becoming rich, and made peace with the notion that I never would. At present I earn enough money to live comfortably and hopefully raise a family one day. I like my simple life. I don\u2019t want to stop working because I like what I do, and I want my life to stay humble. If I make a million+ dollars from this, I will be grateful and pay off all of my debts and probably the debts of my closest friends because to me, that is happiness - All of my friends and family being able to live happy and comfortable lives uncorrupted by greed and money.\n\nThis is my hope at the end of the day for all of this. I hope this works out for all of us who are holding and have remained faithful to this idea for these last few months. Anyone else feel this way?",
