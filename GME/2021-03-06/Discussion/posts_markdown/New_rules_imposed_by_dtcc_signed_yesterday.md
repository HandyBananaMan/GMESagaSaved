This is in no way advice and written with my favorite red crayon in my nose. Long time lurker and holder of gme.($cum 80@$120)

Credit goes to u/LongTermTendieLoser for this find. 
My smooth brain doesnt understand all of it but apparently the dtcc is going to require daily payment instead of at the end of an option as well as implement it within 10 days of submitting.
 Can I get someone with a wrinkle to elaborate further?

Edit: thanks for your replies and helping paint a clearer picture! I hope this is the start of market transparency and also the catalyst needed to margin call these crooked hfs.

Edit2: thanks for the awards apes!!
