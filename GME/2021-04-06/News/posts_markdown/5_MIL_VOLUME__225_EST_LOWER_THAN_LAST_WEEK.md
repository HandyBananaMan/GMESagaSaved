Quick edit for those asking; 

Low volume is good because:
trading sideways, showing HODL and no sell, basically hedgies trading back and forth. Low compared to what we have seen, ever. Last time this low go boom. gives low volatility, makes options much cheaper

Quick edit. I created an ape sanctuary, to move away from politics and drama. I encourage every Ape to gain knowledge in all places
