<p>Correlations are like special relationships. Even if we don't know all the ins and outs of what connects the parties in the relationship, from the correlation we can at least see that they have something special together. Financial beta is such a beautiful thing. We still honour you and your CAPM model, Mr William Forsyth Sharpe. </p>
<p>I want to discuss this article put out by Bloomberg today because it struck me as very significant. When reading the financial press, you have to ask yourself, "why are you telling me this?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhat are you not telling me?‚Äù No one gives you information or tells you what to think for no reason.</p>

<p>The article outlines how <strong>Citadel Securities</strong>, a <strong>broker-dealer</strong>, quietly rose to occupy its current dominant position in the US equity markets, to the extent it has replaced traditional stock exchanges in the execution of orders for many retail brokers (about 47% of all stock trading by retail investors on a typical day). It has managed to dominate the market precisely because it is not a bank, and so doesn't have to comply with the tight regulations that banks are subject to. Goldman apparently said in January that Kenny G's company is now a bigger rival than its long-established European rivals.</p>
<p><strong>Read the article for yourself first, but this is my (speculative) interpretation:</strong> The article is warming you up to get ready to see Citadel Securities getting roasted by the regulators for <strong>payment for order flow and monopolising the market</strong>. The article explicitly says that this attention has been caused by the drama around <strong>GameStop</strong>. It also says that CS's dominance of the US equity markets poses a <strong>systemic risk</strong>. The article explicitly says that this systemic risk is limited, and not at all like a <strong>bank failure</strong>, <em>"which would see a huge amount of capital wiped out overnight".</em> </p>
<h1>Special relationships</h1>
<p>GameStop has a special relationship with CS (otherwise why would CS step in?)</p>
<p>CS has a special relationship with the entire US market. It is a relationship of dominance, which means a large amount of <strong>market risk</strong> is concentrated in <strong>CS</strong>. CS is also, according to its website, the largest <strong>Designated Market Maker</strong> on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>As indicated by the crazy beta, GME has a special relationship with the entire US market. Beta is an indication of sensitivity to <strong>market risk</strong>.</p>
<p>Melvin has a special relationship with big banks, who are its <strong>prime brokers</strong> and include <strong>Goldman</strong> and <strong>JP Morgan</strong> (see filing here <a href="https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf">https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> As per the Bloomberg article, CS is the upstream broker-dealer for a lot of smaller retail brokers. So why step in to help Melvin, a hedge fund, when Citadel's equity business is concentrated in retail? <strong><em>Because CS is helping the prime brokers</em></strong>.</p>
<h1>The players</h1>
<p>The players involved are holding hands like a chain, as follows:</p>
<p>Many little retail brokers (not just RobinHood) ü§ù Citadel Securities, the upstream broker-dealer for retail brokers ü§ù Melvin Capital, a hedge fund blown up by its GME short ü§ù prime brokers who financed Melvin's short position (which on its worst day was about -$16 billion).</p>
<p><strong>TLDR if you haven't read my previous posts:</strong> Melvin blowing up was a problem that was going to bankrupt or at least highly damage its <strong>prime brokers</strong>. Since Kenny is known for being friendly (see article, he has lots of friends), they asked Kenny to help by bailing out Melvin and pulling his market-maker strings to engineer a market downturn around GME while they position net short on their equities portfolio and go long on gold (<em>see my last post about making sure your broker is insured and hedge funds buying gold</em>). Hence, the reversal of the betas - negative for long and positive for short. Kenny is so friendly, that he even had the heart to announce "doomsday" in the FT to anyone willing to listen.</p>
<h1>"Doomsday" or not? I need to know</h1>
<p>Is anyone else saying <strong>"doomsday"</strong>? No. The Bloomberg article explicitly says that this is NOT a "bank failure". J-- Cr---r also explicitly said on the C-N-B-C website that this is NOT a bank failure, do NOT pull out of the stock market. <em>Oh, and remember to forget GameStop, OK?</em></p>
<p>I believe that the MSM is trying to distract us, telling us from the beginning since the Senate hearing and until now that this is about payment for order flow, that there is no connection behind the scenes, and that the shorts have covered.</p>
<p>Since the <strong>Archegos</strong> drama, however, they have been emphasising that the banks are fine, with no identifiable connection to GameStop (<em>although I do have a post about why I think there might be a connection - see timeline</em>). </p>
<p>So then why does Bloomberg feel the need to remind us - while telling us about Citadel, GameStop and payment for order flow, that the <strong>banks</strong> are fine. It's like the way they keep reminding you to forget about GameStop. <em>See my post about why I think the banks are not fine at all.</em></p>
<p>This can be a lot to take in if you haven't followed me up until now because each post I have written builds on the next, so here is my timeline up to 4 April. I published this in a post on Sunday night before the mod drama started:</p>
