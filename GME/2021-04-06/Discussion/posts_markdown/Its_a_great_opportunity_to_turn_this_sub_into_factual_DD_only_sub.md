That's it.

No "APE APE!! 2 Gazzilion is the new floor!!!" BS post.  
No sob story about whatever bullshit.  
No all caps rambling for 10 paragraph to end up with a post that just say MACD is good maybe.

How many of these fucking post: "New shill technic is to say that fake number I made up are made up!!! am crying" I had to read in that sub.

And hopefully no personality cult for people who made completely wrong DD but are for some reason revered as they were DFV himself (obviously personality cult for DFV is fine).

edit: And one of my worst pet peeves, posts with :  
"shills are downvoting into oblivion! help by upvoting me!!" while 5k upvotes, 99% upvoted
