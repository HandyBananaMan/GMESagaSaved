    "selftext": "For some perspective, the BBB- rated bond they opened for $600M represents more than the $523M cash assets they declared at the end of the fiscal year for 2020.\n\nDesperate.\n\nThey closed a Florida location to move back to Chicago and New York.\n\nDesperate.\n\nThere have been days where the entire market is bleeding red so they can liquidate some of their $66B dollars worth of securities, a bet I would assume they were hedging against their $57B short positions across multiple securities across the stonk market. Short positions that we are making them pay dearly for.\n\nDesperate.\n\nThey (or by some miraculous coincidence, someone else who saved their ass) shut down trading back in late January and then restricted the purchase of securities.\n\nUltra desperate.\n\nThey have perjured themselves in front of the House Committee for Financial Services. Ken Griffin brought an entire legal team to set up a teleprompter for him. When asked how many people were in the room with him (this is just my guess) he looked to a legal advisor who held up a hand trying to nonverbally communicate \"don't answer that\" and he misunderstood him to mean, \"say there's just 5 of us\" while the rest of the 12 people in the room were like....\"Oh my God, he's such an idiot.\"\n\nDesperate.\n\nThey've created bots to attack us on our home turf, tried to spread a narrative of FUD and distraction. They have used the MSM to carry their lies to the masses. They have coordinated market crashes with corrupt news outlets. (We still see you MarketWatch.)\n\nDesperate.\n\nThey have tried to make us the public enemy in any way possible. They have claimed we are sexist and we use foul language. Wrong. We use our language. We know each other and understand one another. You will never understand nor will you be a part of that.\n\nDesperate.\n\nApes have thrived. We have shown our generosity in the face of even morsels of tendie gains. We have shown compassion and brotherhood (or sisterhood or non-binary-hood(?)) to one another while standing together to say enough is enough. We have adopted apes, we have eaten crayons together, we have drunk our own piss, and we have become a family.\n\nApes stubborn, apes honest, apes together smart(ish), apes together strong.\n\nIn every corner of the globe, from those holding one share to those holding one million shares, I am proud of every single one of you. I'll continue to ride with you to Valhalla or the ninth circle of Hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1:\n\nObligatory disclaimer: These opinions do not represent any form of collective. The \"we\" referred to in this text is a method of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder attributed to the author and this is in no way financial or life advice. My parents are cousins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:\n\nWow, I forgot the most important part. This otherwise will reek of illegitimacy. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 ",
