Hi everyone. I am gonna be honest with you, I am really starting to get pissed about people spreading lies about what I said. I am getting tagged in about 150 - 200 posts a day and about the same amount of comments. Half of which is people trying to slander my name and telling other people lies about what I said is going to happen this week and how I supposedly said, this is "the last chance" (quote by one of the dumbf\*\*\* that slandered me over the last few weeks) for a Gamma Squeeze or Short Squeeze to happen.

&#x200B;

I am calling out this post specifically, because it gained the most traction and called out u/rensole and me:

[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/m5spf5\/reminder\_that\_the\_19th\_is\_not\_the\_last\_possible\/](https://preview.redd.it/qa1ogy259cn61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=b479bb5b30085e2cf5c2ee345105dbb3ccdb9d18)

(Longer TL;DR at point III)

TL;DR: And I just want to clarify, because it actually seems to be a new FUD campaign (what isn't at this point lol), that theyTM want to do, is split people as hard as they can. (nothing new, but it's just really obvious this week) Every few minutes there is a new post about the importance of this week and then there is the same amount of people saying fuck this week. My thoughts? **I stand by my Endgame DD BUT(!!!!!) I really don't care what happens this week**. Of course I want my prediction to become true, but if it doesn't? I'll keep on living and hodl urge you to do the same. There are so many catalysts this week, next week (even more for next week as of now to be honest, but they weren't there when I created the Endgame DD) and the weeks after. I will just wait and see and can only urge people to do the same.

Quoting my own comment:

![https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m5jn1y\/gme\_megathread\_for\_march\_15\_2021\/gr1xnl9?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://preview.redd.it/09o7j3xp3cn61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ca1d4d157fe84af469c3cc5088bb6a3ec3880d9)

So please. Don't follow every bullshit post calling me out and be critical, here is why.

&#x200B;

I. I created my Endgame DD 16 days ago. I stated that this is **MY** predicted date for the **START** of a squeeze. The bullshit post I quoted above stated the following:

So far so legitimate, of course that can be his opinion. But who are persons behind such posts? Now it's just getting stupid and that's the thing that drives me mad the most.

&#x200B;

II. **Persons behind posts like that**: They are almost always (85 - 90 %) either new accounts, revived accounts (dead for years/months and suddenly start posting on GME, etc.) or they are just inexperienced people that have no clue what they are talking about.

&#x200B;

In this case we are looking at point 3 "inexperienced people that have no clue what they are talking about". The guy that called me out jumped on the GME bandwagon just 3 weeks ago. Before that, he didn't have a single post about trading on his whole profile. Doesn't mean anything, could just be a closet trader, right? Look at his comments over the past 1 - 3 weeks.

I am gonna spare you with more, just look at his profile. It literally only consits of such comments.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Someone who has no experience in trading, being an asshole to the community for weeks, asking for selling points, spreading FUD over a month, saying the squeeze is over and he is going to sell is suddenly an expert on all this and wants people to stop putting dates on things, because it's spreading FUD? BRUUUUH. Don't get me wrong, you don't have to be an expert to give your opinion on stuff, but calling me out like that without any substance and telling people lies about what I said is going to happen this week? That's just bullshit. The person that posted this is a paperhanded pussy, dividing the community with FUD and lies and wants people to agree with him, because he doesn't has the nerve to hold through these dips himself. Especially the OP of the post stated above, wants to make himself look like he holds the community together now, telling people to hold, etc.. He literally spread FUD over one whole month and now this? Give me a break you hypocrite. u/qwerksd

&#x200B;

III. **Clarification about my Endgame DD, Dates, this week, what the guy above stated I apparently said, etc.:** I NEVER EVER(!) said this week is going to be the last chance for a squeeze (Gamma/Short). I said, data supports, that it's going to start at AROUND march 19th. Maybe this week, maybe next week, who the fuck knows? People really just need to hold and stop it with the bullshit posts trying to divide people. That's why I stepped down from posting at the moment. I don't want to add fuel to the fire, by giving such people more opportunities to badmouth and lie about what I said. They damn well know, that I can't respond to every comment because of the ammount of comments, messages, tags etc. I receive everyday. So of course it looks like I don't reply to critique. People that know me a bit better by now know, I love doing that.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to clarify all this. Maybe it makes up peoples mind a bit that this is not a "do or die moment" for GME. **This is a "would be nice if this happens" moment.** The amount of catalysts and data just supports, that things COULD happen in the near near future. But as I just said 20 times, be patient and hodl.

**My opinion on all this:** People saying we should stop to put date on things, are just paper handed pussies and want people to agree, so they won't get dissapointed and paperhand out, when nothing happens on dates being talked about. If there are legitimate reasons to talk about dates and there are dates, on which big things could happen? TALK ABOUT THEM. You don't have to say things will become true, you don't even have to put your opinion out there, but no one should ban you from talking about dates, just because they have nerves made out of used toilet paper. If people hate it, they downvote it. If people like it, they upvote it and spread the word, because there really seems to be good reasoning and reasearch behind such a post. Stop telling people what to do and what not to do, there are functions in reddit for that.

&#x200B;

**IN SHORT: I LIKE THE STOCK ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ And no matter what happens this week, next week, next months, this year, I don't give a fuck. I am going to hold and be patient. This is not a do or die moment. This is a "would be nice if this happens" moment.**
