If anyone here has done their research on the housing market crisis (or seen the big short) you'll be aware of the fact that Steve Carell finds out that the housing bubble is over 20 times larger than originally speculated due to "CDOs". At that point, he goes 10x down his investment. 

CDOs were junk bonds... Citadel bonds are JUNK BONDS with barely a "BBB" rating (which is trash either way). What do you think will happen next? All I know is I'm very excited... 💎🙌🖕🌈🐻🦍👩‍🚀🚀
