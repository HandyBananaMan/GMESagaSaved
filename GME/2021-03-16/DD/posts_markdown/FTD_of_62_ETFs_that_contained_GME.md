Hello Apes,

Edit #2: In an effort to explain my post and not get downvoted to oblivion is that I believe there are many different types of apes here.

One type of Ape yoloed their paycheck or whatever they are wiling to lose. So for these apes, when they see posts that could be labeled as in the FUD category and/or worrisome, they just downvote it because **their mind is already made up;** they are willing to lose it all and **their strategy is basically to convince as many people to HOLD regardless of the data because they are all in and don't care if they lose that money or their general ape brain strategy is, more people hodl, more bananas regardless of any data to convince them otherwise.**

The second type of Ape is me. **Someone who Yolo'd half of his retirement into GME ($70,000) and is trying to look at both sides of the argument to protect my investment. Please be kind to this type of ape because we are the ones that are using that fear and doubt to drive the DD in this thread. We look at this from all angles because we absolutely do not want to be wrong as it will impact us heavily.**

I have updated my DD to include the latest FTD reported of all 62-63 ETFs that own GME.

The data is a little disappointing if these numbers are correct, as the total FTD appears to be about .0025% of the ETF's total Market Capitalization. However, this is off because the market capitalization of these companies was measured when their last reported holdings date was made available on [etfdb.com](https://etfdb.com) (early march), and the FTD market capitalization was measured in the second half of February.

In the second half of February, GME's price was anywhere between **$50-$100**. During the recorded date,  **the average price of GME when all of the recorded market capitalizations from etfdb was averaged out from all the shares, it was = $245.10 price per share (taking total estimated # of shares owned by ETFs and dividing by GME's market capitalization for that day).**

If we assume that **all failure to delivers on ETFs were GME (they are not), we would have to multiply the share price of GME at $50-$100 (let's be conservative and hurt our data to go with the highest share price and do $100) by 2.45 (GME's average share price in the first two weeks of March was $245.10) to bring it to March's correct capitalization. This would bring the total market capitalization of the FTD's up to 241,367,233.1, meaning that FTDs would be anywhere between .0025% to 6.3% (with the high end being 100% of the ETF shares shorted because of the sole reason of GME).**

The video on the dark side of the looking glass for financial markets demonstrated good arguments for the DTCC's FTDs to be anywhere from 7.5% to 35%. If GME was being shorted through ETFs, I just don't see it in the data.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtkaMx12otQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtkaMx12otQ)

This is not to say that the squeeze won't happen and that we don't have many catalysts that are going to drive this engine to the moon, but I would like someone to please look through my methodology or at least the FTD data and prove that I am wrong.

To understand my spreadsheet at a deeper level, you may need to read my previous DD on when I calculated the total number of shares all 63 ETFs owned:

Edit: TLDR; my data doesn't show that GME is being shorted through the ETFs of a significant statistical margin unless the DTCC is blatantly reporting false data. We also must take into account that alot of FTDs are settled between brokers outside of the DTCC's scrutiny. This last part may be the key piece of the puzzle to show us why FTDs are so low, but our confirmation bias likes to take us to wherever it makes sense, so I personally try not to think about situations that I have no data to measure against after getting my butt kicked from other apes to be more mindful and careful with my data  u/ScootPigrim.

Edit: This part is just speculation to consider: Additionally, the DTCC and regulators have been protecting these hedgies for years, so why would they stop now?  That could lead us to believe that they are purposely reporting false data while sweeping it under the rug; alternatively, if they are purposely reporting false data and also trying to brush it clean, could there be a different interpretation of  **SR-NSCC-2021-002? Specifically, about the part of the DTCC having the ability to close out positions when if it doesn't cause market volatility? That second part means they are prepared for a squeeze and know a squeeze can/will happen. From my interpretation of the verbiage, it appears they are proactively trying to limit the size of the squeeze.**  Are they trying to work out a backdoor bargain to keep all HFs afloat and ease the process out? Very important questions to consider and think about.

**Edit 3:** The reason why FTDs for ETFs might be low could be this little point. My buddy Zea in the GME discord questioned whether or not these Hedgefunds **already held shares in the ETF**. Failure to Deliver results in **Naked shorting and not being able to find enough available shares**. However, if the HF's already held the ETFs, they could short sell their shares regularly.

**Edit 4: It could be that this data is from the second half of February... If the shorts are using ETFs more heavily recently becuase of the SSR rule, this won't be seen in FTDs until we start getting data for the first half of March Around March 30th.**

I do need to research on how this would drop GME's price though, as I would have thought it would only drop the ETF's price.

Thank you!
