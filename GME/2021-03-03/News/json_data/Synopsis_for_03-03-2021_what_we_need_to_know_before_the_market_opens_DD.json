GTFO with your \"Neo Silver Shekels\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6kxg56knlsk61.jpg?width=666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14c32b9f2100be07686af8603628a1038ba1d84\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FUD\n\nLet's introduce our best little buddy again\n\n(seriously I love this picture so much I printed it and put it on a pillow next to me)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz8uucagisk61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=caa2c93b90099f4f8ba8178e621657f2e89ce147\n\nWe have been seeing an increase in Bots shills and Trolls on this sub.\n\nThat's awesome, that means we are doing something right!\n\nAgain why spend money to hire a small army to spread FUD if they didn't stand to lose a big part of their cash? Just remember Citadel lost billions because of us, this is how WSB would call it \"loss porn I could actually jack it to\"\n\nAnother smart ape made a great thread you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwgbtr/gme_please_read/)\n\nIt's a small explanation of the situation we find ourselves in.\n\n# Backup Discord.\n\njust in case anything happens to Reddit, for example go offline just when the hype kicks up we have made a Discord Server.\n\nThis is in no means meant to be used as a main way of communicating, but it's there just in case.\n\n[https://discord.gg/PwqsYYUR](https://discord.gg/PwqsYYUR)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bane aka Killer Moon](https://preview.redd.it/bipfxy5aksk61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e2413651e1adfffebfcf1f4326d565fb16c8c98)\n\n# Eyes here Noobs!\n\nFor the new guys, Hi!\n\nif these are your first few red days, relax you'll learn to love the red.\n\nNormally if you don't know what's going on and it turns to red you'll most likely think \"shit I need to sell\" well this sub go's the other way. and you may think \"WAIT WTF are you guys retarded?\" yes. yes we are.\n\n**GMES WEEKLY GROWTH IS 300%**\n\nThey told us it was over at $400, and no one here sold, why because it kept dropping to $40, 20 above pre mini squeeze and then it went back up to $120 so that's a total of 300% compared to the week before!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost traders usually see green and red mixed, once we got the mini squeeze in January we have faced actual resistance from multiple fronts. usually you'll get red days and then a big FUD campaign. Meaning you will see a red day with loads of shills posting shit like \"its OvEr SeLl nOw!!!\" because they are worried what we do with our money.... right, ever had anyone say they're worried over your money?\n\nAnyway, chill you'll learn to love the Red, we only had red days since the 28th of January, and we will see some more of those before it's over. just learn to love the dip.\n\nOr as this sub sees it \"discounts\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd just for the Shills trying to get my Shekels away from me, this is the current data compared to the prev mini squeeze, notice anything?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ekf1120nsk61.jpg?width=558&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=219d4c03566e63253755ad934ee1d4b07eeb15f4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Coming full circle.\n\nsmart ape u/dookiebuttholepeepee (I love how the meme has become full circle of melvin getting banged by users named bigdaddydongus and dookiebuttholepeepee)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ig6krzhnsk61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=eded62a3fd358aadd73fedec9ea7d9e7ec048f0b\n\nIt seems that the overal downwards trend is meeting the upwards trend.\n\nnow lets zoom out a bit more... what if there is a second cup being made at the $350/$400 mark? we'd be literally be launching into alpha centauri at some mach speed shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oalpuigjssk61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d00de4fbcd7c926d226ae9b8582636dcddd8c28\n\n# Official News outlets.\n\nJust a thought, go down the rabbit hole and find out who owns most of the mainstream media... do you think those happy few would have something to gain by saying \"it's over\"? and flop like a fish going left to right? they do but check it out yourself I want you to form your own opinion.\n\nOk everyone has seen Jimmy Cramer lose his shit quite publicly in the past week, we get it guys.\n\nLeave the poor guy alone, Either he is under an extreme amount of stress or he actually has some mental problems. Either way please refrain from posting this over and over and over.\n\nSame go's for Uncle Bruce, good guy or not the guy has an angle, he makes money by spamming his paypal/subscription/onlyfans. Not saying his theories are not valid, on the contrary he has made some very good points and offered us some very good theories.\n\nBut don't forget every youtuber/influencer who talks about this is not doing it for altruistic reasons, if I suddenly added a \"go fund me\" \"Only Anchorman Fans\" or my paypal link you'd all be weary and thinking \"wait... wtf?\" so don't take everything at face value and question everyone and everything, including me and my statements.\n\nAnd please for the love of god, stop spamming the same videos of Bruce, Momoney and cramer over and over, make a thread dedicated to each of them and openly discuss them there? just a thought.\n\n(and no posting videos and other stuff related to jimmy bruce or another influencer is not a ban-able offence I just think it doesn't help flooding the board with just these 3 guys).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0s4srl4rsk61.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=544b978badb29db55f806aaad7a05228914ac41c\n\n# The big fish.\n\nOk so we've surmised that Melvin and Shitadel aren't the only ones for some time.\n\nBig brain chimp found some more info  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nit comes down to:\n\n* MELVIN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LP\n* SUSQUEHANNA INTERNATIONAL GROUP, LLP\n* UBS Group AG\n* GROUP ONE TRADING, L.P.\n* CITADEL ADVISORS LLC\n* CITIGROUP INC\n* WOLVERINE TRADING, LLC (got some Adamantium in this bitch)\n* MAPLELANE CAPITAL, LLC\n\nHow these people are involved and in what way, check the thread I've linked to it go's into explaining it a bit better than I could do here.\n\nBut don't forget about the another big fish, namely **US**\n\nWe have seen some speculation and calculations flowing around and we thought we where small fish, and we are, but we are many small fish with all the same goal, 100k tendies.\n\nBut you may think we are like what? 1 to 5 shares each? yes we have many smaller guys with us in our pond, some people own 1 to 5 a lot of people are around the 50 mark and I've seen some dudes who have pumped their entire savings into this for months being at 1000 and up shares (hell some even above the 5k) and remember u/deepfuckingvalue may hold 100.000 shares and is vocal about it but a lot of other guys who have the same or more are silent. you know why? because if I owned 20k shares are even more I'd be very hush hush about it as well.\n\nSmart brain  u/Aydenn7  said it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw15gf/a_few_lines_about_gme_please_read/)\n\n    1    Price doesn't matter until the squeeze has been squoze.\n    2    The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.\n    3    Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.\n    4    Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created         \n     before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post \n     negative comments/posts.\n    5    GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction \n     to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align \n     this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.\n    6    The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something \n     they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually \n     go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world \n     has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.\n    7    Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, \n     that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is \n     lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.\n    8     As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days. Don't be afraid \n     that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't.\n    9     Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by \n     selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce \n     its impact if you day-trade.\n    10   THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED. IT IS A GAME OF TRUST.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wz5ja3pssk61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=afeac182798dfb7bb24463e643d533c820ae9ed7\n\nAgain this is nothing more than the \"prisoners dilemma\", this is a game of trust.\n\nIf you're new this may be scary, but in the past month and a half my fellow apes have earned my trust so much I've yolo'd my entire life savings into this shit. it's not a lot but it's everything I had.\n\nI've also experienced FUD, just like everyone else, but the more research I did, the more DD I checked the more confident I became. the only tip I can give you right now is to not immediately respond to your emotion, Rule your emotions don't let them rule you!\n\nFight Fud with logic, common sense and research.\n\nKnowledge is power!\n\nRemember we know what Melvin and Shitadel are doing, we know our enemy at this point.\n\nThey still don't know us as we are a collection of autistic retarded apes, and we don't even know what we are doing half the time.\n\nSo sit back relax, ask your stewardess to bring you a banana milkshake and just get the dip and hold on. we have no timeframe and we are on no clock, we can outwait them every day, every week every month.Let them try to spread Fud, let them try every dirty trick they know, we are to retarded to get it anyway.\n\nAnd as always\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot2y1ipytsk61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=993bb663409bdb8d5634cc601ad248675f491b0a\n\nAs always none if this is financial advice, this is just my opinion and I'm fucking retarded. I tried making lego crayon pancakes and I'm quite literally shitting bricks and half assembled lego kits.\n\nAlso if you think I've missed something let me know and I'll add it in here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1:\n\nI posted about another company here, after feedback from the community I believe this may have been bad information, that's why I removed it, hope everyone understands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:\n\nDeepfuckingvalue just tweeted.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2dgn4di5ytk61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3a4f8461d3942b159de3a8877fd6a4510d8af05\n\nI know it's from Slumdog millionaire, thats all I know",
