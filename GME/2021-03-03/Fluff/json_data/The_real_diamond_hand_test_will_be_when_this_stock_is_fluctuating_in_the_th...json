I'll be honest, watching it go from 500 to 40 was hard. 200 to 110 was hard. If we are really going to shoot for 100k we need to mentally prepare to diamond hand like never before.\n\nedit: yeah, saying you aren't selling at x thousand is easy because compared to the price now thats already unfathomable gains. but when its at x thousand and drops to x/2 thousand, THATS when we need to diamond hand even harder. THATS when you need to eliminate the thought of it being over because it is not. we determine the price. we can choose to determine that it will be 100k+. but if we all chicken out at 5k, then we chose 5k to be our demand rather than 100k.\n\nedit2: wtf do I do with gold?\n\nedit3: people are PMing me and asking me questions bro idk shit lol GME was my first ever stock and is currently my only stock idk man use Google\n\nEDIT 4: ho lee fuk this blew up. disclaimer I am not a financial advisor. I do not know what I am doing. I am barely even a retail investor. I literally just yolo money for fun to pass time. I do not know how to read and write. I am delusional. I am not capable of forming thoughts and therefore nothing I say should be taken seriously or as advice. I am shitposting to pass the time. Everything I write is satire, meant to be ironic, and is in no way indicative of how I actually think, feel, or what I believe in. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. the only advice in general I have is for you to do what makes the most sense for you.",
