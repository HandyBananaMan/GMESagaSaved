This post is an update to the original post by u/tapakip.\n\n(3/1) Monday someone out of the PHLX exchange (Philadelphia) purchased roughly $45MM worth of deep ITM calls ($12 and $15 strike)   [https://imgur.com/a/8ZCd3b9](https://imgur.com/a/8ZCd3b9)  = 3415 calls\n\n(3/2) Tuesday same exchange another $20 million in deep ITM calls [https://imgur.com/gallery/Qp2phEm](https://imgur.com/gallery/Qp2phEm) = 1800 calls\n\n(3/3) Wednesday another massive purchase of deep ITM calls from PHLX $45 million expiring 4/16/21\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/Z05Vqmg](https://imgur.com/gallery/Z05Vqmg) = 4210 calls\n\nIn total here we are looking at a purchase of roughly 9425 calls from what we believe is the same buyer over the course of the last 3 days. Unfortunately I do not have access to the historical data to see if the same buyer had bought more previously. Regardless this gives the buyer the rights to buy 942,500 shares by April 16 (presuming these options expire ITM). This is just one of the many factors setting up a potential gamma squeeze.",
