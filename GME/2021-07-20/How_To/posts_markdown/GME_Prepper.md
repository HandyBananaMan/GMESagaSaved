If you read this entire thing. Thank you.

I write to you as an older millennial who came from nothing. No help. Had a rough go. Finished school. Worked hard. Still couldn’t climb out of lower class. Had -$200 in my bank account and in 5 years transformed my mind and my business to closing serious six figure deals regularly.

That being said, this post isn’t about me. This post is about YOU. How can YOU prepare yourself NOW before anything happens and you wake up one day with more money than you know what do to with. 

You need to be prepared and the preparation starts NOW. 

Real wealth is quiet and stealth and listens more than it speaks. Drill this into your fucking head right now. Do not chase this lifestyle and be very skeptical of who you follow if they have a huge media and social platform. Buffet and Dalio are the real deals. Find and listen to people with their thinking and TEMPERMENT. I know plenty of very wealthy people who hold a subdued and quiet temperament. You wouldn’t know their net worth by passing them on the street. It’s time to play the long game apes. Prepare yourself now.

The Foundation 

Purpose
Define your purpose. What is the reason, post-squeeze, you will get out of bed? What makes YOU want to make the world a better place?

For me, I want build new systems and innovation. 

Vision
The vision is your long term goal of whatever you do. Do you want to start a business? What does that look like in 10 years? Do you want to impact your community? What does successful impact in your family, community or world look like? Write these down.

Mission
The mission are the things you commit to on a daily basis to fulfill your purpose and achieve your vision. Write these down and connect them back to your bugger vision.

If you can sit and think with your smooth brain and write down your purpose, vision and mission - you’re already many steps ahead. This will be your guiding light for your life. It may not happen the way you want but this will propel you forward into the future. You will be moving towards your path of meaning in life.

Plan

Get your head right
Get your brain wrinkled
Make a plan
Stick to the plan

Write things down. Make notes on your phone or a journal. Keep this around for ideas, business, money, strategy, things you learn when you watch YouTube or read new DD here. Document and make notes. I like to write these down in physical form because it’s always around if shit goes south, electricity goes down or it keeps it separate from being digitally accessible or found on my machine. Journal. Make notes.

Who you will help

We talk a lot about who we are going to help, what we want to change and how this money will impact others. I want to encourage you to stop and think about this and to write some things down. Below are three lists I think you could work on for when the time comes.

Three list types:
1. Will help no matter what
2. Might help
3. Will never help

Make a list of immediate people you plan to help. No matter how much you make post-squeeze - these are the people who will get taken care of one way or another. 

Make a second list - people whom you might help. You’re not sure unless they put in some work and provide you a business plan. 

Last list - a list of people you know who you will NOT help. No matter what. Think about this and stick to the plan. They will blow smoke yo your ass, call you, text you, invite you out, do “favors”. These people whom you already identified you will not help. They likely know it as well. 

Commit to this list and DO NOT stray.

How to sell during MOASS

Make a plan of how you personally plan to sell. Write this plan down. 

Stick to the plan when the squeeze happens. Your mind will be euphoric and you may not be able to make the best decisions when you’re seeing the biggest numbers ever in your account. Think about this. Write it down and stick to your plan. 

Below is what I will be doing and following so I can visually see how many shares I can sell off at certain points and mark them off as I go. 

Make a grid. In the grid, list on the far left column 
1/32, 
1/16, 
1/8, 
1/4, 
1,2, 
1/3. 

Across each row, list the amount of shares you own and how many shares equal each row - for example if you have 50 shares. Write 25 and 25 in two boxes next to 1/2. Or 12.5 in 4 boxes next to 1/4. This way you have a visual map of your shares and amounts. When the squeeze hits your heart is going to be pounding harder than a gorilla in heat.

Get your ape soul right

Mind, body, soul. But if you’re soul is not settled, or moving in the right direction, you’re going to make selfish, greedy, malevolent or ignorant decisions. Not just for yourself but could impact those whom you are also trying to help. You 100% need to get your soul right. Whatever dark shadows live down deep - time to shine some light and have a hard look at those things. Get sober. Get rid of drugs and booze for the time being. Forgive yourself. Forgive others who’ve wrong you. Seek inner peace and freedom. If you want to be the inverse of the HedgeFucks who destroyed the system - you need to be the inverse of them. This requires the inner parts of you to be set right.

Meditation
Prayer
Empathy 
Journal 
Go quiet on social media
Stay away from drama 
Tie up loose ends
Apologize if you’ve wronged anyone
Prepare your loved ones 
Forgive yourself
Forgive others
Consider reading some ancient philosophy, theology, proverbs, ancient texts. Seek this out and do not skip over this. You need to look deeply at yourself

“Clean your room before you try and change the world”. Clean up the soul before you try and help others.

Get your body tuned

Prepare your body now. Start small. The pandemic took the piss out of us, but we gotta be firing on all ape cylinders. You owe it to your future self. Take of yourself each day. 

Sleep
Stress
Diet
Exercise

Plan for future finances

Not financial advice. But if you don’t know about finances - I suggest you start reading up about the topics listed below. Plenty of info out there. Be very SKEPTICAL about signing up for courses or seminars or classes. Information is available if you’re willing to learn. The more you know, the better you are equipped to smell the bullshit and to make the right decisions. Knowledge really is POWER.

Accountant
Banking
Bank accounts (multiple)
Business licenses LLCs
Trademarks 
LegalZoom
Lawyers
Estate and Trust planning
Retirement 
Insurance
Life insurance 
Large auto insurance program
Will / living will

Once you have these things in order. Print them out along with backups of your birth certificate, bank statements, social security, and important family documents. Make copies. Vacuum seal them. Put them in a safe. Then transfer all those copies to USB drives as digital backups. Keep these in a safe place. 

————-

Prepare for making changes

Delete or minimize information you share on social media. 
I’d start pruning your accounts now. 
Remove photos or posts that may be used against you. Lawsuits are real and shitty people exist.
Create privacy settings on accountants or delete them all together. 
Switch email addresses or create a separate. 
ProtonMail FTW
Update and change passwords
Get a VPN
Turn off location settings on your phone
Delete apps you don’t use or rely on
Change call and text settings to only accept numbers in your contacts

———-

Talk with those you trust
Keep your circle tight
Talk with close people you trust
Be careful of financial advisors
Be careful of bankers
Be careful of real estate agents

Keep in mind, people who work in finance, banking or real estate - if they were as smart as they try to make you believe, they wouldn’t be doing the jobs they’re doing. They’d be incredibly wealthy sipping drinks from a yacht while someone else takes your call or meeting. Take their advice with a grain of salt and do nothing make any decisions without doing your own research. Always make decisions by doing your own research. However you stumbled here and have invested in GME either by way of some tip, reading DD or hearing about it - you made a decision from research. Apply this to every part of your life.

Important question to ask:
What is the risk?
If someone can’t answer this, they are either lying or too stupid to go into business with.

A lot of people are going to pitch you ideas. I get pitched new ideas all the time. Hell, I got one this morning via text from a business partner. Point is: if someone can’t be honest about the risks or they haven’t done enough research to find the risk, do not do business with them. Let them sort out themselves or the problem before going into business with them.

————-

Time. Budget. Risk. 

These are the most important things you must consider when starting something new. Of all of these, time is most important to me. When you say “yes” to one thing, you say “no” to everything else. Protect your time like your life depends on it.

Invest in things that will build you capital, income and profit over time

Small businesses
Private placement investments
Equities
Real estate
Property
Raw land 
Art
Crypto 
Physical metals (gold / silver)
- I am very serious about gold and silver as a hedge against our eroding dollar. Sure crypto has value, but it is not physical nor has stood the test of time throughout human history. I highly HIGHLY suggest looking at gold and silver if you come into a lot of money. Experts say 10% of your portfolio is a good approach.
Cash - might as well put some hard cash aside as an emergency fund. 6 months of your living expenses and bills is the way. 

Don’t blow all your money on big boy toys. Go get a few, pay off your debts and have a little fun. But if you’re coming into life changing money, you want to play for a situation where that money continues to grow. So you basically are being paid on interest of investments every year to basically stay alive. The goal is to generate more money you can spend each year. This is how you build wealth. What you do with that wealth is up to you: for me, I’m going to radically innovate on some things at global scale. Money is the fuel to get me there. And investing myself means I am not beholden to any other investor, debtor or bank. That’s the goal.

Assets vs Liabilities 

If you absolutely have to purchase a liability, stay patient and do your research. Buy the best one you can afford or find so you only buy it once. 

If you run a business or startup a business - consider making lots of purchases that become business assets and write offs for your business. Assets vs liabilities is important to understand. When you make purchasing decisions from this framework it puts things into perspective about what you “want” vs what you “need”. When you’re “needs” outweigh your “wants” you have changed you’re thinking and are on a path of independence.

Get your house in order

- Prep for 6 months in case shit hits the fan. In case of a real economic downturn or civil unrest, the last thing you want to be doing is driving around buying a ton of things with a possible target on your back from people you’ve done business with. That real estate agent? The land scalper? The food delivery person? People whom you don’t know will suddenly remember that you’re probably a good target. Get yourself setup with food, water, bug out fear for you and your family, medications, cash and home protection. Now this might be extreme, but I leave this as a point to wrap up. The goal is to start thinking about your life as blocks and systems. Build the blocks and stack the systems. You can do this. Educate yourself. Follow the right people. Listen to wisdom and learn from those who have really done it. Tune out the noise and the snake oil salesman. Protect your money and your future - you’re the start of building a new generational wealth for your family. You are the catalyst of change. You are the next Carnegie or Rockefeller. This is a new day and a new path.
- I wish you all the best. I read the posts here of this can change so many lives. I want that for you. And more so I want you to be able to hold on to it after you get it. 
- Stay safe. Stay smart. Stay diligent. You got this.

Signing off,

To the moon
