It's only a part-time bartending gig, so I don't expect it to pay much, but it'll be a lot easier to put money aside for GME than it is now that I'm just trying to minimize expenses on my already-minimized student loans :') wish me luck apes!

Update: Got the job! Gonna be pulling pints in a hotel bar lads, looking forward to it!
