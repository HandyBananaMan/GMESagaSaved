<p>Yesterday I posted about a single buyer acquiring 4,095 deeply In The Money Calls at the steep premium price of $46.2M combined.  Here is that thread:</p>

<p>Today, thanks to /u/Dan_Bren alerting me in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lvt1hd/3415_deep_itm_call_options_bought_right_before/gpgxbsg/?context=3">his comment in that thread</a>, I found out that another 1,800 Calls worth $19.2M in premiums were purchased near close.  Like the ones purchased yesterday, they were deeply in the money, and also expire April 16th.</p>

<p>This brings us to just under 6,000 Calls in total worth around $65M+ in premiums, just for this one entity.</p>
<p>I also wondered in the post yesterday what the purpose of all these calls might be.   Many of you astutely pointed out that it was likely a HF flipping the script, and going from short to long, foisting the short position onto the Call writers, most likely a MM.  You also linked to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwXLRoAw3Z4&amp;feature=youtu.be">Uncle Bruce's video</a> about the possibility of them doing exactly that, which he posted shortly before this occurred.  If you haven't listened to it yet, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>As was the case yesterday and will be forevermore, I am not a financial analyst, just a GME APE who likes the stock.  Do your own DD and don't act solely on my comments.</p>
<p>Also a shoutout to this community for making me feel loved yesterday.  You guys rock.</p>
