<p><strong>Part 0: GME on Short Sell Restriction List</strong></p>
<p><strong>GME was on SSR List yesterday</strong>, which significantly reduced the ability to use short sales to depress the stock price. Therefore, we would not expect to see much short activity today and what allowed the two rallies today to go unchecked. (If you don‚Äôt know what the SSR list is, here is an explanation <a href="https://www.daytradetheworld.com/trading-blog/short-sale-restriction-ssr/">https://www.daytradetheworld.com/trading-blog/short-sale-restriction-ssr/</a>)</p>

<p>------------</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: FINRA Data</strong></p>
<p>I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! <a href="http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html">http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html</a> or <a href="https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily">https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily</a></p>
<p>(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)</p>
<p>Short volume went down significantly today, but the % of Total volume continues to be high at <strong>57%</strong>. There was an additional <strong>13 million</strong> in short volume today, on top of the <strong>22 m Friday and 33 m Thursday</strong>. <strong>Total volume was expected to decrease since GME was on the SSR list</strong>. When GME was on the SSR list on Feb 3rd, both short volume and total volume dropped by 40% on that day, only to regain all the volume the next day.</p>
<p>The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at <strong>57</strong>% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.</p>
<p><strong>CAVEATS ON DAILY SHORT VOLUME:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/tri_fire_engineer/">u/tri_fire_engineer</a> for bringing this up last time and sending me the data. <strong>It actually</strong> <strong>showed that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke</strong>t</li>
<li><strong>Daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted</strong>**,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other things that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month but that‚Äôs no fun at all!</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions used:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)</li>
<li>GME Total Shares: 69,750,000</li>
</ul>

<p>The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at <strong>60.35%</strong> ( <a href="http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0">http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0</a> ) Unfortunately there is no citation or link to where they are getting this, but it is the FINRA site, so it should be as LEGIT as it can get.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Borrowing Shares - March 2 UPDATE</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: iBROKER'S NOW SHOWING ONLY 55,000 AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT!</strong></p>
<p>Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.</p>
<p>The data available through iborrowdesk.com (<a href="https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME">https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME</a> ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker‚Äôs FTP site (<a href="https://iborrowdesk.com/about">https://iborrowdesk.com/about</a> ).</p>
<p>Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/4xyrhnm4vmk61.png?width=1823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfbc5b4e2c96aa7e4798ef3f215e1cdf3dd9b074</p>
<p>Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from <strong>2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 400,000 at 4.8% borrow rate</strong>! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on <strong>Jan 27</strong> when we saw some huge intraday price swings.</p>
<p>u/rchance1153 also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lvip1y/updated_fidelity_shorted_shares_available/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">posted today about Fidelity shorted shares availability</a> and gave me permission to post it. Fidelity has \~540,000 shares available at 3%, which is also significantly lower than in the past.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/pyisnsz5cmk61.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=779043c1d5337065835baf234f6f8c29a892eff9</p>
<p>These observations would suggest a net increase in the short position. If it was only shorts covering and then rebuying, you would see a net zero in, but we have seen a net drop in availability of over 75% in only 3 sell days.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: ETFs</strong></p>
<p>This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'XRT' is currently 105% shorted (10.6m shares on 10m) and GME as 6.75% of its portfolio @ 523,000 shares. This is actually a SIGNFICANT DECREASE in shorting by almost half, as it had nearly 176% shares shorted as of Friday. NOTE: The number of shares and % shorted can not be found at the same source as the SSGA website (company offering the ETF) does not publish the short position ‚Äì its almost like they think it would negatively effect peoples view of it üòâ</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt">https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/0qqsfyo6cmk61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4152bacf5f67dc23ff5b989868f75e6ba32df583</p>
<p><a href="https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/">https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/pnbrlid7cmk61.png?width=257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33d59d0e0a057d718ca10989f9b2ad9eb81ec763</p>
<p>This would equate to approximately <strong>550,000 GME shares (1% of Float) shorted through XRT</strong>. u/cstooby brought up a great question about how often is an EFT shorted and is XRT an outlier to others.</p>
<p>This site actually has page dedicated to the most shorted ETFs and even includes the stat on their homepage, so that should answer the question about how standard of a practice it is. <a href="https://www.etfchannel.com/type/most-shorted-etfs/">https://www.etfchannel.com/type/most-shorted-etfs/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/pc7qhxy7cmk61.png?width=430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c864c0ecf310a6aa5269f9d50356cebfad8d8bc2</p>
<p>And as for how out of line is 100+% shorting, well XRT is the only one and is only 1 of 3 EFTs shorted more than 50%, so I think this is could be considered an outlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/">https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/</a></p>
<p>They have also published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).</p>
<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).‚Äù</p>
<p>NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. This is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><strong>*BONUS* Part 4: The Big Price Jumps Today</strong></p>
<p>At approx. 11:51 am, there was a significant purchase of shares in GME (1.5m+), BB (4.3m+) at the exact same time, bringing up both share prices. This was also seen again at approx. 3:15 pm.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/1kbpzlp8cmk61.png?width=386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0a48e0b09e768f3d15f73bf26b1d045326c284a</p>
<p>The first jump corresponded EXACTLY to when u/TheRoaringKitty, aka DFV himself posted a GIF to twitter!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/lv40b1l9cmk61.png?width=457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d09fb2462a55fb20d8485290b6b36cebe54ae27c</p>

<p>This is could probably be one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A fund decided that it was time to cover for their shares because they thought this GIF would bring along the MOASS</li>
<li>There are still large investment firms being bullish on the stocks and thought this GIF would increase trading on ‚ÄòMeme Stocks‚Äô</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, I hope DFV keeps posting on twitter!</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>
<p>THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT <strong>üíéüôå</strong> üíé will prevail!!! (and Tweets from DFV can‚Äôt hurt either üòâ)</p>
