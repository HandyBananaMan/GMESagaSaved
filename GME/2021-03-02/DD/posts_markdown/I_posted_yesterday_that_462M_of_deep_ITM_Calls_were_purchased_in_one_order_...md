Yesterday I posted about a single buyer acquiring 4,095 deeply In The Money Calls at the steep premium price of $46.2M combined.  Here is that thread:

Today, thanks to /u/Dan_Bren alerting me in [his comment in that thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lvt1hd/3415_deep_itm_call_options_bought_right_before/gpgxbsg/?context=3), I found out that another 1,800 Calls worth $19.2M in premiums were purchased near close.  Like the ones purchased yesterday, they were deeply in the money, and also expire April 16th.

This brings us to just under 6,000 Calls in total worth around $65M+ in premiums, just for this one entity.

I also wondered in the post yesterday what the purpose of all these calls might be.   Many of you astutely pointed out that it was likely a HF flipping the script, and going from short to long, foisting the short position onto the Call writers, most likely a MM.  You also linked to [Uncle Bruce's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwXLRoAw3Z4&feature=youtu.be) about the possibility of them doing exactly that, which he posted shortly before this occurred.  If you haven't listened to it yet, I highly recommend it.

As was the case yesterday and will be forevermore, I am not a financial analyst, just a GME APE who likes the stock.  Do your own DD and don't act solely on my comments.

Also a shoutout to this community for making me feel loved yesterday.  You guys rock.
