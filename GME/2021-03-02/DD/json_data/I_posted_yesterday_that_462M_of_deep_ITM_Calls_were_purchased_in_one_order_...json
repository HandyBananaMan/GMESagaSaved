    "selftext": "Yesterday I posted about a single buyer acquiring 4,095 deeply In The Money Calls at the steep premium price of $46.2M combined.  Here is that thread:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lvt1hd/3415\\_deep\\_itm\\_call\\_options\\_bought\\_right\\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lvt1hd/3415_deep_itm_call_options_bought_right_before/)\n\nToday, thanks to /u/Dan_Bren alerting me in [his comment in that thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lvt1hd/3415_deep_itm_call_options_bought_right_before/gpgxbsg/?context=3), I found out that another 1,800 Calls worth $19.2M in premiums were purchased near close.  Like the ones purchased yesterday, they were deeply in the money, and also expire April 16th.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/BwXw5HO](https://imgur.com/a/BwXw5HO)\n\nThis brings us to just under 6,000 Calls in total worth around $65M+ in premiums, just for this one entity.\n\nI also wondered in the post yesterday what the purpose of all these calls might be.   Many of you astutely pointed out that it was likely a HF flipping the script, and going from short to long, foisting the short position onto the Call writers, most likely a MM.  You also linked to [Uncle Bruce's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwXLRoAw3Z4&feature=youtu.be) about the possibility of them doing exactly that, which he posted shortly before this occurred.  If you haven't listened to it yet, I highly recommend it.\n\nAs was the case yesterday and will be forevermore, I am not a financial analyst, just a GME APE who likes the stock.  Do your own DD and don't act solely on my comments.\n\nAlso a shoutout to this community for making me feel loved yesterday.  You guys rock.",
