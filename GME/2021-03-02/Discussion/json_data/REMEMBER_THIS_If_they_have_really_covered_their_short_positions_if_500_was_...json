    "selftext": "This is not a bubble to crash , this is a RABBIT HOLE. They need to buy much more shares than the amount issued by the company. Because they have T+2 settlement they can hide everything.  Imagine what if we have INSTANT SETTLEMENT? They will tell you they are not ready because instant settlement will reveal all their market manipulation.  \n\nIf there are 69 million shares outstanding and if they need to cover 100 million shares because of naked shorting,  It is simply impossible in a world with instant settlement,  However they can hide this and buy more time in a world with T+2 settlement.  \n\nIn my view this is a DIAMOND mine.\n\nUse your common sense,  it's much more powerful than college degree. \n\nThis is not a financial advice,  just an opinion and knowledge sharing.",
    "title": "REMEMBER THIS: If they have really covered their short positions, if $500 was the peak, if this stock was crashing then they wouldn't do so much FUD media propaganda, they wouldn't have blocked the buying, the stock wouldn't bounced back to $200 again, they wouldn't lie under the oath. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1b",
