<p>This is not a bubble to crash , this is a RABBIT HOLE. They need to buy much more shares than the amount issued by the company. Because they have T+2 settlement they can hide everything.  Imagine what if we have INSTANT SETTLEMENT? They will tell you they are not ready because instant settlement will reveal all their market manipulation.  </p>
<p>If there are 69 million shares outstanding and if they need to cover 100 million shares because of naked shorting,  It is simply impossible in a world with instant settlement,  However they can hide this and buy more time in a world with T+2 settlement.  </p>
<p>In my view this is a DIAMOND mine.</p>
<p>Use your common sense,  it's much more powerful than college degree. </p>
