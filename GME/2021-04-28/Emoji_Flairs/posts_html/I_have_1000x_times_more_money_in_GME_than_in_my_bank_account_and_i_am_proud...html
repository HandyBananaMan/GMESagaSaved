<p>Europoor here, i got kicked out of my shitty job in November because of the pandemic and since then i am living of the welfare system feeling like a leech, but i literally felt too bad and depressed to take a new shitty job, where people tell you that you should be happy since you earn a couple cents more than minimum wage.</p>
<p>I had enough of being in bad jobs where you only get into via temporary employment agencies which cancel your working contract right before they are legally obligated to pay you more.</p>
<p>You guys gave me strength and confidence to BUY and HOLD 💎🙌🏻, without this community i might would have cashed out, since I am in desperate need of money especially after moving with the little money i have per month.</p>
<p>Thank you so much apes, let's get the rocket started 🚀🚀🦍🦍❤🐜🐜💎🙌🏻</p>
<p>I'M JACKED TO THE TITS!!</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Don't worry, my money spending is calculated and i make ends need every month, i know how much I can spend on what. I recently even got dept free and i am ready for the rocket 💎🙌🏻🚀</p>
