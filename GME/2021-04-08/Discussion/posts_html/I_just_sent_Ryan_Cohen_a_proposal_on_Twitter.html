<p>TLDR: Democratize the used game trade.</p>
<p>A lot of people complain that GameStop pays too little for used games, and that the collection of used games takes up space and man power. I just proposed to Ryan Cohen on Twitter to have GameStop stop the used or older game trade ins at the stores and online etc... I propose that GameStop.com also have a section like eBay or Amazon where you can sell your own used items at whatever price you want and GameStop gets a cut for use of the platform. They would make a ton of money probably more than they make now from selling used games with almost no overhead. The wallet you use online for this to both buy and receive the money can be used on GameStop.com or in the store to buy new games and accessories etc...</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> Apparently this came up before:</p>
