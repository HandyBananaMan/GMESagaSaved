Here\u2019s the statement:\n\nBEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, THE COMPANY\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT(S) IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THE PROXY STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING AND THE PARTIES RELATED THERETO.\n\nWhy would the proxy statements demand such a big notice? My guess is because we all need, among other things, TO TAKE THE TIME AND MAKE SURE OUR SHARES AREN\u2019T LENT OUT!!! It\u2019s time we all get our ape smooth brains in shape and get studying so we do this right and send this rocket into the sun!\n\nEdit:  adding links and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nShareholders meeting announcement\n\nhttps://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-2021-annual-meeting\n\n8-k\n\nhttps://gamestop.gcs-web.com/static-files/8764231a-51d6-474d-a1b4-390e263e602a\n\nEdit 2: u/calamariace did a great write up on turning everything off:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2n5wv/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nEdit 3: not financial advice yada yada.
