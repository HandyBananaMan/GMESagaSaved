Apes. RC and friends want us to get knee deep in info before the meeting. Hereâ€™s the statement:

BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, THE COMPANYâ€™S SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT(S) IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYâ€™S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THE PROXY STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANYâ€™S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING AND THE PARTIES RELATED THERETO.

Why would the proxy statements demand such a big notice? My guess is because we all need, among other things, TO TAKE THE TIME AND MAKE SURE OUR SHARES ARENâ€™T LENT OUT!!! Itâ€™s time we all get our ape smooth brains in shape and get studying so we do this right and send this rocket into the sun!
