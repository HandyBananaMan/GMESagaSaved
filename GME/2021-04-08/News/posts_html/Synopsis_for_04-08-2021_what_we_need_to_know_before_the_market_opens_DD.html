<p>Good morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole,</p>
<p>Has anyone seen Brick?</p>
<p>*insert flashy intro card*</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>None of this is financial advice</p>
<h1>801</h1>
<p>Ok so yesterday there was some confusion on what rule came into play so let's do a quick rundown.</p>
<p>The OCC-801 changes how much they can pass on and how they do it, Basically the OCC can pass on costs of a member default to the other members. like "spreading the load"</p>
<p>The NSCC-801 Notice of Filing of Advance Notice to Amend the Supplemental Liquidity Deposit Requirements.</p>
<p>This one allows for daily and intra day risk assessments, collection of Secondary Liquidity Deposits (SLD), and forced closing of positions of the member can’t pay the SLD. see this as for example what happened to RH at the end of January, you need X amount to keep playing pay up or you're out, but instead of just being out it's a margin call.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell the NSCC-801 is getting a chance to get filed on the 9th, and then take 10 business days to pass.</p>
<p>Also some good reading that goes along with this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mlv6io/dtc_letter_of_securities_possession_not_what_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a>, &lt;this reads like a "proof or ban" SEC edition to me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/t6i1fi1s3xr61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5269b0c4b1759ccedc53e6bd8aa7b763119d8a6">One community, multiple trees \&lt;3</a></p>
<h1>SEC meeting</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/9vcvmajjzwr61.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5595574675ce8ef583398acdb14bf697770b65a</p>
<p>So another closed door meeting, but the minutes should be available shortly after, at least that was the case last time, I believe we got it the day after.</p>
<p>the bulletin points raised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Institution and settlement of injuctive actions;</li>
<li>Institution and settlement of administrative proceedings;</li>
<li>Resolution of litigation claims; and</li>
<li>Other matter relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings</li>
</ul>

<p>So is this good or bad ? I personally believe good because it looks like the SEC has been quiet so long in order to prepare for 1 hit TKO. it's not unlikely that these are all normal meetings by frequency but if we look at what they are going over... yeah I think it may be related to the current situation of gme.</p>

<h1>Third Bridge interview</h1>
<p>the interview is now publicly available <a href="https://thirdbridge.com/transcripts/gamestop-e-commerce-transformation-structural-business-overview-30-march-2021/">here</a></p>
<p>the only thing that bugs me is "Former divisional leader at GameStop Corp" why couldn't they just say this is Mr. Sherman/aimee/Cohen or whatever, this may be normal but I'm used to seeing names with interviews.</p>
<p>Lovely ape  u/itslooigi  did a writeup <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mmbbo2/gamestop_ecommerce_transformation_structural/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a> of the transcript, so it's easier to read for our fellow apes.</p>

<h1>Rock God</h1>
<p>Unfortunately u/houstman got his twitter account suspended yesterday.</p>

<p>Great thread, won't TLDR it but it's something you should read imo</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/k630w4rx3xr61.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=706de5a059e1e28b722086a42f8790bd2e33b8a3">Fanmade :\&lt; hoped this was real</a></p>
<p>Now before I go I want to touch on one simple thing, it's about one specific tweet DFV made.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1379818752015880207">https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1379818752015880207</a></p>
<p>No drama!</p>
<p>We are one big family of apes, and we are focused on one thing, the Stonk. we don't do drama, politics or ideology for a very simple reason, we can find thousands of minute things to divide us but we all have one thing in common, the stonks.</p>
<p>So lets focus on the good things, and lets forget about the things that don't matter right now, and if you disagree with someone, don't call them names, ask questions.Why do you think X, or how did you come to your conclusion because I believe Y.</p>
<p>The more civil we can keep it the better primed we are to help each other, and the more helpful opposing viewpoints become, because disagreeing with someone can be a very good thing, if done right both parties learn and grow.</p>
<p>So please be kind to one and other, this is how we where able to create a great community in these past months and flourish.</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
<p>If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.</p>
