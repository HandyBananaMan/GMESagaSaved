<p>Apes. RC and friends want us to get knee deep in info before the meeting. Here’s the statement:</p>
<p>BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, THE COMPANY’S SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT(S) IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY’S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THE PROXY STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY’S 2021 ANNUAL MEETING AND THE PARTIES RELATED THERETO.</p>
<p>Why would the proxy statements demand such a big notice? My guess is because we all need, among other things, TO TAKE THE TIME AND MAKE SURE OUR SHARES AREN’T LENT OUT!!! It’s time we all get our ape smooth brains in shape and get studying so we do this right and send this rocket into the sun!</p>
