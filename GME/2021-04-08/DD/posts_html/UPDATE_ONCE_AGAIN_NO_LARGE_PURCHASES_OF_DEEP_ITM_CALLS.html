<p>Good afternoon my fellow autists,</p>
<p>Wanted to put out a quick update to you all with today's largest options trades for GME. Shown in the image below.</p>

<p>As you can see, not a single large trade came out of the PHLX exchange meaning that its very likely these DEEP ITM calls were left totally untouched today. We will continue to monitor the situation to fully understand the impacts of the implementation of DTC 005 and its impact on our beloved GME.</p>
<p>Keeping this one brief today but feel free to fire away any questions you have in the comments and I will try to get to as many as I can.</p>
<p>Since a lot of people have been asking: New DTCC rule basically enables a tracking system so they can only use this method once more and then the shares will be tracked and they wont be able to use the same method on the already tagged shares. </p>
