    "selftext": "I need to throw my ELIA TLDR right at the top. \n  \nI have STRONG reason to believe that Cohen will be not just the chairman but ALSO the CEO. Follow my logic below and tell me if I'm reading too deeply into it please!!\n\n  \n  \n  \nWe've all seen the posts this morning.\n  \nHere's the link, in case anyone missed it.\n   \nhttps://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-slate-director-candidates-2021-annual-meeting\n  \nAn important takeaway here is this:\n  \n>GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 08, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (\u201cGameStop\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced that it is nominating the following six individuals to stand for election to its Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) at the Company\u2019s Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \u201cAnnual Meeting\u201d) on June 9, 2021: Alan Attal, Larry Cheng, Ryan Cohen, Jim Grube, George Sherman and Yang Xu.\n\n   \nAlan Attal, Larry Cheng, Ryan Cohen, Jim Grube, George Sherman, and Yang Xu.\n  \nThose are the six individuals being nominated for election to the board of directors.\n   \nIf we read deeper into the article we see that:\n   \nEffective immediately, the Board has appointed Mr. Grube to serve on the Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee.\n\n>New Director Candidate Biographies\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLarry Cheng\u00a0is Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Volition Capital, a leading growth equity investment firm based in Boston, Massachusetts and the first investor in Chewy. He has more than two decades of venture capital and growth equity investing experience based on time at Volition Capital, Fidelity Ventures, Battery Ventures, and Bessemer Venture Partners. He presently leads the Internet and Consumer team at Volition, focusing on disruptive companies in e-commerce, internet services, consumer brands, and digital media and gaming. He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard College where he concentrated in Psychology.\nYang Xu\u00a0is Senior Vice President of Global Finance and Treasury at The Kraft Heinz Company. She has more than 20 years of broad experience across the capital markets, finance, strategic planning, transactions and business operations in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Prior to The Kraft Heinz Company, she held roles with Whirlpool Corporation and General Electric Healthcare. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in Finance from Wuhan University, a master\u2019s degree in management from the HEC School of Management and a master\u2019s in business administration from the London Business School.\n   \nWe now know who Larry Cheng and Yang Xu are. Great. We ALSO know who Ryan Cohen is (obviously\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udda7\ud83d\ude80)\n  \nNow, who are the other 3?\n  \nOh right.\n    https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574\n   \n>Joining GameStop\u2019s board along with Mr. Cohen are Alan Attal, Chewy\u2019s former top operations executive, and Jim Grube, who once served as Chewy\u2019s chief financial officer. The online retailer was sold to PetSmart Inc. by Mr. Cohen for $3.35 billion. in 2017, and went public in 2019.\n  \nAlan Attal and Jim Grube came on board with Cohen last year. They're just now getting their positions officially.\n  \nThat just leaves George Sherman. Why does that name sound so familiar? \n  \nOh right!\n  \nhttps://news.gamestop.com/leaders/george-sherman\n  \nHe's the mother fucking CEO. Of Gamestop.\n  \nBut if he's already the CEO, which is considered a Director position, then why he he on the list of individuals being nominated for election to the board? He's already ON the board. \n  \nI went ahead and did some investopedia research for definitions and explanation and I can't help but be really excited by what I found.\n  \nHere is the link if you want to read yourself:\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0912/3-reasons-to-separate-ceo-and-chairman-positions.aspx#:~:text=In%20many%20companies%2C%20the%20chief,initial%20founder%20in%20those%20roles.\n  \nImportant take-away though, is this:\n>\u00a0In many companies, the\u00a0chief executive officer (CEO), who holds the top management position in the company, also serves as chairman of the board.\n  \nSo a Chairman can ALSO be a CEO. Sounds like the nomination for Cohen as Chairman doesn't preclude him ALSO being CEO. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nBUT... If the current CEO is standing for nomination to the board, he MUST be receiving a new position, right?? None of the other standing member of the board are on that list, so it must be a new position, right? Why would the CURRENT CEO step down but not leave the company? \n  \nIf Cohen pushed him out, why wouldn't he just take his equity and leave? He could cash out his shares and retire on his own private island today. He stands to get more in a few weeks. Why wouldn't he just take all those shares that are worth 50x what they were worth when he stepped into his position, sell them for huge profits, and move on? \n  \nBecause even George Sherman sees Ryan's vision. Even George believes in it strongly enough to step down to a lesser position on the board to ride on Cohens coattails. \n\nThis is hugely bullish my dudes and dudettes.",
