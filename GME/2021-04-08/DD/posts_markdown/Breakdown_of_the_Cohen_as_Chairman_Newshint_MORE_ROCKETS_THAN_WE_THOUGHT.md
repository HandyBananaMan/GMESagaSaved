I need to throw my ELIA TLDR right at the top. 
  
I have STRONG reason to believe that Cohen will be not just the chairman but ALSO the CEO. Follow my logic below and tell me if I'm reading too deeply into it please!!

  
  
  
We've all seen the posts this morning.
  
Here's the link, in case anyone missed it.

An important takeaway here is this:
  
>GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 08, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (“GameStop” or the “Company”) today announced that it is nominating the following six individuals to stand for election to its Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) on June 9, 2021: Alan Attal, Larry Cheng, Ryan Cohen, Jim Grube, George Sherman and Yang Xu.

   
Alan Attal, Larry Cheng, Ryan Cohen, Jim Grube, George Sherman, and Yang Xu.
  
Those are the six individuals being nominated for election to the board of directors.
   
If we read deeper into the article we see that:
   
Effective immediately, the Board has appointed Mr. Grube to serve on the Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee.

>New Director Candidate Biographies   
Larry Cheng is Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Volition Capital, a leading growth equity investment firm based in Boston, Massachusetts and the first investor in Chewy. He has more than two decades of venture capital and growth equity investing experience based on time at Volition Capital, Fidelity Ventures, Battery Ventures, and Bessemer Venture Partners. He presently leads the Internet and Consumer team at Volition, focusing on disruptive companies in e-commerce, internet services, consumer brands, and digital media and gaming. He received his bachelor's degree from Harvard College where he concentrated in Psychology.
Yang Xu is Senior Vice President of Global Finance and Treasury at The Kraft Heinz Company. She has more than 20 years of broad experience across the capital markets, finance, strategic planning, transactions and business operations in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Prior to The Kraft Heinz Company, she held roles with Whirlpool Corporation and General Electric Healthcare. She has a bachelor’s degree in Finance from Wuhan University, a master’s degree in management from the HEC School of Management and a master’s in business administration from the London Business School.
   
We now know who Larry Cheng and Yang Xu are. Great. We ALSO know who Ryan Cohen is (obviously🚀🚀🚀🦧🚀)
  
Now, who are the other 3?
  
Oh right.

>Joining GameStop’s board along with Mr. Cohen are Alan Attal, Chewy’s former top operations executive, and Jim Grube, who once served as Chewy’s chief financial officer. The online retailer was sold to PetSmart Inc. by Mr. Cohen for $3.35 billion. in 2017, and went public in 2019.
  
Alan Attal and Jim Grube came on board with Cohen last year. They're just now getting their positions officially.
  
That just leaves George Sherman. Why does that name sound so familiar? 
  
Oh right!
  
https://news.gamestop.com/leaders/george-sherman
  
He's the mother fucking CEO. Of Gamestop.
  
But if he's already the CEO, which is considered a Director position, then why he he on the list of individuals being nominated for election to the board? He's already ON the board. 
  
I went ahead and did some investopedia research for definitions and explanation and I can't help but be really excited by what I found.
  
Here is the link if you want to read yourself:
https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0912/3-reasons-to-separate-ceo-and-chairman-positions.aspx#:~:text=In%20many%20companies%2C%20the%20chief,initial%20founder%20in%20those%20roles.
  
Important take-away though, is this:
> In many companies, the chief executive officer (CEO), who holds the top management position in the company, also serves as chairman of the board.
  
So a Chairman can ALSO be a CEO. Sounds like the nomination for Cohen as Chairman doesn't preclude him ALSO being CEO. 🚀🚀🚀
BUT... If the current CEO is standing for nomination to the board, he MUST be receiving a new position, right?? None of the other standing member of the board are on that list, so it must be a new position, right? Why would the CURRENT CEO step down but not leave the company? 
  
If Cohen pushed him out, why wouldn't he just take his equity and leave? He could cash out his shares and retire on his own private island today. He stands to get more in a few weeks. Why wouldn't he just take all those shares that are worth 50x what they were worth when he stepped into his position, sell them for huge profits, and move on? 
  
Because even George Sherman sees Ryan's vision. Even George believes in it strongly enough to step down to a lesser position on the board to ride on Cohens coattails. 

This is hugely bullish my dudes and dudettes.
