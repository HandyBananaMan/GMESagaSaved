The weekends feel like an eternity when you're waiting for the market to open. What a weird world we live in where on the weekend I look forward to Monday. What is wrong with me? Besides the fact that I eat crayons and sleep in my wife's boyfriends Honda Civic. Enough chit-chat let's get into the data.\n\n[GME Biggest Trades 4-19-2021](https://preview.redd.it/3m4ixcq758u61.jpg?width=1222&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc4cffcb273fe29903cf64b0fff98736a96380f2)\n\nAs you can see from the image above there were no large block purchases of DEEP ITM calls. Nothing really important to note in the options activity (on the Biggest Trades list) as the largest transaction looked to be some $190 calls that traded for less than $1 million. Pocket change compared to the tens of millions we saw in purchases previously. As always I will continue to monitor this on-going situation and keep you posted.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if FTD's begin to pile up as we have seen a fairly low amount of these DEEP ITM calls in the recent days. Unfortunately our access to this data is delayed (I believe 2 weeks) and so we will be in the dark on this to some extent. I don't know about you guys but I've reached this Zen phase of \"inevitably we will be rich, I don't really care when it happens.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7a69pgp458u61.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d795e03dc44e2bd40c25444f9bed7686c7095a",
