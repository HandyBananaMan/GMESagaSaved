No matter what happens love everyone and pay it forward.  \n\nA corrupt system was exposed and is collapsing and it is our responsibility as apes to help follow apes who did not know what was going on or could not comprehend it.  Yes, get your house and pay your taxes but dont do what they did.  Donate your time, donate some money to those in need.  \n\nKarma is a bitch and your friend.  Its time to start thinking about how we as apes will change the world and create a better planet for the apes not of the apes.  \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96\nTo the moon my friends.\n\nNot financial advice, just some wholesome advice.",
