<h1>Title: PSA:. Remember HFs are watching us. Don't give them any data to work with and don't be a douche. Claim that victory with grace and munch some Tendies after.</h1>

<p>If this weekend proves anything (other than HFs r Fuk), it shows just how closely HFs are watching us.</p>
<p>They took active measures to change their behavior and data available to the public very soon after their actions were made public in this sub.</p>
<p>IF you must post positions, I would maybe try to at least obfuscate the data they are able to mine in some way.... Maybe change your total invested number to  show $69420 and hide your cost basis.  These are both amazing data points for them to work with and they can extrapolate a battle plan to continue into super advanced fuckery with enough information.  Also applied to when you decide to sell a few shares during the MOASS, just think even if Melvin was finally margin called there could be others that haven't been and can sti use your information against you.</p>
<p>If ü¶ç think he want to share his üçå positions with other ü¶ç, just try to do it in a way that doesn't benefit HFs continuing this fuckery.</p>
<p>Also, try not to be a douche even though these asshats really deserve it.  Take the high road and help prevent any opportunity for them to initiate a smear campaign on retail because they will if given the opportunity.  </p>
<p>You have already won the war, you are just now waiting for them to admit defeat and kick off the aftermath.  Depending on how this all ends up going down , there might be a LOT of angry people out there so keep riding that high üê¥ all the way to the üåö</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like u/rensole added this to his morning DD (thanks for watching ren! Much ‚ù§Ô∏è ü¶ç).  Not sure if it's apes downvoting or more shillbots, but w/e... IDGAF about karma or upvotes or awards.  Just remember to be excellent to each other.</p>
