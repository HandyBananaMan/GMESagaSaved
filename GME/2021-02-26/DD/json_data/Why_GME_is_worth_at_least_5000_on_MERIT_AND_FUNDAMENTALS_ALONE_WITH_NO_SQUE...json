    "selftext": "For those of you who are holding for the sole purpose of the short squeeze, read on. Those who did proper DD might already know this.\n\nGME shares are considered discounted considering where the company is heading.\n\nThe reason this whole thing started was because of Ryan Cohen. This guy recently came on board to Gamestop. Before, Gamestop was run by a bunch of boomer old fucks who was just milking Gamestop for dividends and slowly driving it to the ground.\n\n**This COHEN dude is super smart.** Seriously, if you don't know how this guy is, you shouldn't even be holding GME stocks right now.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan\\_Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=7319fe925840](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=7319fe925840)\n\nThis guy basically founded a e-commerce petfood company, called MrChewy (to be later called Chewy), in 2011, got $15 million in VC funding in 2013, got more money from Blackrock and T Rowe Price Group in 2016, was raking in $900 mil, and became the biggest online pet retailer. Then his company got bought out by Petsmart for $3.3 bil next year in 2017. ***So this fucking guy in 6 years created a company that was valued at $3.35 billion dollars.***\n\nAll this while PetCo, Petsmart, and Amazon were a thing!!! He literally did the impossible and out played 3 giant ass companies and came out number one!!!\n\nKICKER IS THIS GUY WAS YOUNG AS FUCK AND STARTED THIS WHOLE THING **WHEN HE WAS 25 YEARS OLD**!!!!! He ain't no old boomer that's out of touch (exceptions of course for our boomer crowd, like Uncle Bruce, he's cool).\n\nNow, you take this guy who worked his Cohen blackmagic on a petfood company, and apply that to Gamestop. Do you SEE why it's so fucking exciting?!\n\nIt's not only Ryan who's onboard, joining this guy are 2 other OGs in the CHWY business,  Alan Attal, Chewy\u2019s former top operations executive, and Jim Grube, who once served as Chewy\u2019s chief financial officer. You basically have the dream team. These guys are the '95-'96 Chicago Bulls triple threat Rodney/Jordan/ Pippen of the e-commerce world.\n\nALREADY they are making drastic changes to how Gamestop is operating. They are cutting back on costs by getting rid of auxiliary storefronts, while also getting cash for the sales. IMHO they're going to do an AMAZON and just have some central warehouses across the states, with some flagship experience stores like those of Apple or Microsoft or Samsung, which also serves are further distribution centres for their same day delivery service. 1 picker in a warehouse now replaces 4-5 people working in a retail store, and they save expenses on wage, rent, and store maintenance. They are AMAZONING the fuck out of Gamestop. Already we have people getting [insane delivery times for their merchandise.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lt5yaj/my_gamestop_order_arrived_90_mins_after_ordering/)\n\nNot only that, Gamestop isn't just your average video game retailer. They're also pivoting into PC GAMING HARDWARE! Everyday more and more PC components and hardware are being added to the site, and there are [thousands of items now.](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/pc-gaming) Even GPUs!\n\nSo we're beginning to see where GME is headed. Now, all this is useless without numbers and math, so as the last gift to you, you fucking smooth brained ape who bought GME without knowing all this shit, **HERE IS WHY YOU SHOULD SLEEP EASY IF YOU BOUGHT IN UNDER $200!!!**\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~ BASIC APE MATH AHEAD\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nLet's take a look at $CHWY. The petfood market in the US is approx [$40 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/253983/pet-market-sales-in-the-us-by-category/) in 2020. In a market worth $40 billion, CHWY's valuation is $41 billion and share price is $101 USD. This is despite of having competition from Petsmart, Petco, and Amazon.\n\nNow let's look at $GME. The video game market in the US is approx [$65 billion.](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/video-games-united-states/) Are there any other competitors to Gamestop like Petsmart, Petco, and Amazon is to Chewy? Not really. But wait, there's more! Since GME is expanding into PC hardware space, the PC gaming hardware market is [$4.5 billion](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-16-pc-hardware-and-accessories-spending-grew-62-percent-in-the-us-in-2020), and Computer Hardware in general is worth approx. [$300 billion.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-computer-hardware-market-2020-154400978.html) Therefore, the Total Addressable Market for Gamestop in the near future is approx. $370 billion dollars, and that's just in the US.\n\nBut Gamestop is a global company, and is the world's largest video game retailer, with over [4,800 retail store in 16 countries world wide](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-opens-1000th-international-location). Now obviously with this new e-commerce strategy the stores will of course go down, but the global reach of Gamestop will not be changed at all.\n\nThat's why if you count global sales, an estimated $370 billion TAM for Gamestop is actually super super conservative.\n\nNow just think, Ryan's baby $CHWY, playing around in a sandpbox  worth $40 billion, has a market cap of $41 bil and a share price of $101 USD. What happens if Papa Cohen's 2nd baby, Gamestop, gets dropped of in a sandbox worth $370 billion, or 9x the sandbox of $CHWY? Shouldn't the market cap by 9x as much as $CHWY, or $360 bil? But right now, Gamestop's marketcap is ONLY $7.1 billion!!!! YES! WHAT THE FUCK! That means each of the 70 million shares of GME is worth $5000!!! And again, I took a conservative low ball of many numbers to calculate this result. So that's 50x what GME shares are worth today.\n\nLast question, you can ask, hey magical shiba inu, I can't wait 10 years for my share to get to $5,000! Well, that's where I tell you to shut the fuck up and get some mother fucking EDUCATION! Did you NOT remember what you read up at the top, you smooth brained ape! How many years did Ryan take to go from scratch with CHWY to being #1? Only 5 years! That's FROM SCRATCH!\n\nWhat is Ryan working with for Gamestop? ALREADY established rapport and brand name recognition, ALREADY presence in 16 countries, ALREADY an existing customer base and functional online storefront! HE DOESN'T NEED 5 YEARS to turn Gamestop around into a powerhouse! Your magic rocket ticket pretty much is guaranteed a minimum of 5x (if you only take 10% of my estimated $5000 valuation ). 5x in less than 5 years, all with no fucking squeeze at all.\n\nNo TL;DR. READ TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE AND GAIN THE DIAMOND HANDS!\n\nI LOVE THIS STOCK AND PAPA COHEN AND GAMESTOP! And just to be clear, I love Papa Cohen first. Gamestop just happens to be ran by Cohen, which means it also receives love. Without Cohen, Gamestop would probably just keep on stagnating away, ran by boomers who don't give a shit about games, and just want to leech off gamestop, continuing getting their bonuses and dividends, until gamestop dies. \n\nNot financial advice btw, I'm just a magical shiba inu who types with my tail.\n\n\nEdit: math fixed.",
