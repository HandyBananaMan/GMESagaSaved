#Title: I noticed lately that some shills are making fun of people that are holding 2 or 3 shares! if you are not able to say something nice! just shut the fuck up! you know that just 1 share can be very significant if we have millions of people holding! so please mods keep an eye out for those morons!

I noticed also that some shills are trying to break our unity by posting that they sold high and buy low to shake and disrupt the purpose of holding. so please everyone stand your ground you have standards those morons doesn't.
