<p><strong>Update to Update</strong>, because I see so many people still have a lot of questions.  This is everything I can think to tell you:</p>
<p>I got through after being on hold for approx. 40 minutes.  Did not record phone call but had my husband listening while it was on speaker.  Rep. was advised my husband was listening to call.  During the call with TD Ameritrade, the rep (Ben) manually forced the execution of the Option Contract and said that anyone else having the same problem should call in for "broker assist".  (Note:  Ben described it as "manually forcing", that is not my wording.  After the call, I thought it was odd, since it implied that he knew the normally available feature was actually blocked, but I have no proof of that).  I mentioned that this is a contract that TDA has no legal authority to interfere with or alter.  He said he believed it was a mix up because of the other restrictions placed on GME due to volatility.  He said that the Call Option would have exercised after EOD, if it was still ITM, but conceded that the delay prevented me from trading any of those shares during the day, should I want to do so.  He apologized for the hassle, and that ended the call.  Honestly, I can't think of anything else to tell you.  Make of it what you will.</p>
