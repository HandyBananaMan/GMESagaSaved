<p>Good morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole,</p>
<p>And welcome to my rollercoaster of emotion!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>WTF IT WENT FROM $170 to 100?!?üêí!!!</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Lets start with something basic as this will be applicable throughout everything you guys will see through this.</p>
<h1>‚ÄúThrow your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight." -Tendieman Sun Tzu</h1>
<p>for the people thinking WTF is he talking about, relax I often ask myself that as well. But this is a quote from "the art of war" and it's something that has been used for business, war and everything else they can use it for.</p>
<p>We are hurting the hedge funds a lot, and you may think to yourself.... "are we?"</p>
<p>YES! I've seen a post yesterday from Orthex stating that on Wednesday alone we where costing them 800+ million a day.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/q8j89k5yysj61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b256e0a02268488cc3470d6553492d4890c0ef9">https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/gamestop-short-sellers-billions-losses-reddit-traders-wallstreetbets-rally-gme-2021-2-1030125873</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>with losses so big would you not try everything to stop this? that's what we've seen yesterday. they bought a fuckload of Short options, this affects the underlying stock and artificially drops the price. Then they can sell all those borrowed shorts and the price drops even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME">https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME</a> You can see they borrowed 1 million more shares in a span of hours.</p>
<p>users have also made full threads explaining this and doing amazingly well</p>
<p>check hem out here:</p>

<p>(can't seem to find the image of Orthex stating it so if someone could perhaps give me a link I'll upload the image here)</p>
<p>Ok makes sense right?</p>
<p>Ok then let's go onto a little bit more technical aspects. By conventional calculations WE the retailers hold somewhere between 20% and 30% of GME's total stock.</p>
<p>Gme total available stocks are  <strong>69.747M</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/4fkwqzm0tsj61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be2fc0e71ae44b8c318ba57243c38ce9b252f57</p>
<p>in the past weeks the volume has been dying down slowly, and we can see that in the charts that have been posted before, ending with 24 Feb, with the volume at about 6/7 million.Then yesterday we suddenly had  150,308,703 of volume, that's 2312,44% more volume in one day.</p>
<p>This is fuckery and it's to be expected.</p>
<p>Again read the quote, we are bankrupting these assholes by simply buying the dips and holding.</p>
<p>so expect them to try everything to get out of the hole they dug for themselves!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And if you see people posting "<strong>OH NO ITS OVER NOW!@!#$"</strong></p>
<p>They're either new to this and don't know how this works, Idiots, trolls or shills.</p>
<p>We have been in the RED for WEEKS! let that sink in, WEEKS some of us maybe even longer than that! Remember we where only at $40 2 days ago, and then we shot up to 190 and back to 108 and at the time of writing in premarket we are at $123.THAT IS A 300% of the original price.</p>
<p>Think about it, this stock is a rollercoaster, but no matter what happens we are up over a 100% in less than a day! and that's rare with normal stocks, but this motherfucker will go up even more.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Call me maybe?</h1>
<p>Ok so to a lot of people have trouble with ITM OTM Calls Puts etcI'd advise to check this guy out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta9FfikSl9M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=StockMarketsWithBruce">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta9FfikSl9M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=StockMarketsWithBruce</a></p>
<p>around the 20 minute mark he gives a great explanation on how stuff works.</p>
<p>we have a fuck ton of calls on the table right now, and they're from 120 to 150 all the way up to 800, if these get triggered we could see a domino effect today and see this thing spiral out of control to top !</p>
<p>Edit Caveat: I am in no way saying we should all buy the stock together, or coordinate a "pump" this is illegal and I do not endorse this in any way shape or form, just like DFV I believe in the stock and I believe in the underlying business. it is my personal belief that this company can turn around and be the next amazon, the squeeze is just an extra incentive for me personally</p>
<p>But there are a FUCKLOAD and I mean HOLY FUCK 150,674 ITM CALLS RIGHT NOW</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>As always expect the 10AM drop, this is like clockwork with these guys.</p>
<p>and just a reminder, look at the end of January the numbers line up very nicely with whats happening in the past days.</p>
<p>- January 25th: <strong>Open: 96.73, high:159.18,</strong> low: 61.13, <strong>close: 76.79</strong></p>
<p>- January 26th: <strong>Open: 88.56</strong>, high:150.00, low: 80.20, <strong>close: 147.98</strong></p>
<p>- January 27th: Open: 354.83, high: 380.00, low: 249.00, close: 347.51</p>
<p>For me this is very familiar.</p>

<h1>SEC, 3 words middle is Elon</h1>
<p>Also  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ren3666/">u/Ren3666</a>  has earned an extra wrinkle in his noggin.</p>
<p>On the 25th of Feb the SEC has reduces the fees for Security transactions from $22.10 to $5.10 effective immediately.</p>
<p>how this affects everything is simple, this is a good hint that there will be a huge sell off of securities so that HF's can sell them to recoup losses from what they will lose and have lost with GameStonk right now.</p>
<p>go read his entire writeup right <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lshpuj/25th_feb_breaking_news_sec_reduces_fee_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a></p>

<p>Nice lambo.</p>
<p>As u/maddao1 has posted</p>
<p>we need to relax a little bit.</p>
<p>All we need to do is relax, get greedy and remember to NOT PAPERHAND THIS BITCH. There have been calculations flouting around saying we are going to land between 100k and 130k EACH. You motherfucking crayon eaters know what that means? That means 1 Lambo for every 2 shares, and you'll have extra money to spend on spraying huge ass fucking bananas on this sweet ride and still have cash left to get you a nice lambo.</p>
<p>What do I base this on?on this: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls78g7/why_the_130k_ai_is_wrong_and_why_thats_a_good/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls78g7/why_the_130k_ai_is_wrong_and_why_thats_a_good/</a></p>
<p>Anyone who has ever gotten statistics knows how this works.</p>
<p>Anyone who hasn't leme give you a rundown, there is a 99.7 to a 100% chance we will be between 120k and 140k, there is a 95% chance that we will land between 110k and 150k and there is a 2.5% chance it will be bigger.</p>

<p>Remember the HF morons think we will let this go for pennies on the dollar, but they underestimated our retard strength diamond grip we have.</p>
<p>We aren't going anywhere because we all know this mother fucker will get so high its amazing.</p>
<p>The thing is, these idiots are trying to get out of this situation the same way they got in, by keep shorting going.</p>
<p>but let me tell you something they don't understand.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2ufjdfxa1tj61.jpg?width=1078&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b053a258011bd0cec3396cafd00250a84672865">4 wongs don't make a wright</a></p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>let me tell you a little tale of how normal trading works.HF shorts stock, people sell off and they can buy the stock for pennies on the dollar, because due to normal thinking a person would sell so they can recoup some of their losses.</p>
<p>Reddit trading:HF shorts stock, price drops and we get some nacho'sWhy nacho's? BECAUSE WE LOVE THE DIPWe don't have the normal thinking that the stock will drop to the bottom, because we have the mathematics on our side showing this is going to be a gamma squeeze at some point.So we don't panic, <strong>AND WE HOLD!</strong></p>
<p>This is where the Diamond hands comes from, if the stock falls back down to 4 usd we wont sell because we know it will go back up, so we see this as nothing more than a sale.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This fucks with the boomers minds so much, as they have never seen this happen before, normally people sell when it drops. but there is one fucking boomer that always bought when others sold.and you know who that guy is ?Warren FUCKING Buffet.</p>
<p>The best investor to have ever exploited the market.This guy is so god damn wrinkly brained its amazing</p>
<p>"Be fearful when <strong>others</strong> are greedy. Be greedy when <strong>others</strong> are fearful"</p>
<p>And the hedgies are fearful</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>So what's next?</h1>
<p>these idiots have shorted more, so expect some price drop around the 10am. And as none of us are selling, expect it to rise again throughout the day.</p>
<p>For he people who are fearful of "will the guy next to me hold?" don't be, we have been in this for close to 2 months, it was scary in the first week as we didn't know what the community would do.But guess what, everyone held and the day after and the day after that.</p>
<p>Trust the person next to you to be just as greedy for tendies as you are.</p>
<p>The "prisoners dilemma" is non existent here anymore because we know our fellow apes here hold the god damn line as if they where trained by king Leonidas himself.</p>
<p>If you see volume spiking throughout the day, don't worry it's friday and as we have learned, there are 3 things to expect</p>
<p>1- the 10 am drop</p>
<p>2- the power hour, this is the last hour of the day, usually a lot happens here in the price (it swings up and down etc)</p>
<p>3- fridays can be wild.</p>

<h1>So Rensole what to do?</h1>
<p>same thing we have been doing every day Pinky</p>
<p>Buy the dip, hold the line, and give nothing back.</p>
<p>These fuckers did the same thing in 2008, we all lose everything while they had parties celebrating their new found bailout money. remember the people who lost everything, their houses, their jobs, family members and friends we may have lost because they took their own lives due to the financial ruin THEY caused.</p>
<p>This time the tables are turned they thought they where gods, untouchable and unbreakable.</p>
<p>But we made them bleed and you know what that means?</p>

<p>Edit 2: removed the Yellen post, seems this info was not correct, sorry for the confusion!</p>
<p>Edit 3: Big brain u/Fenrir324 has made a great synopsis of how the statistics calculation works.</p>
<p>this is his work:</p>
<pre><code>Basically what I was saying is that limit based calculus tells us that "Though infinite, it can be defined in relation to a single point." 
Meaning that there will be a peak eventually, it'll happen, ü¶ç want their üçå.

If I were to throw a dart at a wall and record the event, I could go back and review it. 
I could review the distance it travelled in half the time it took to hit the board, then half the remaining time, then half of the remaining time after that, etc ad infinitum. 
But I know that the dart hits the board eventually, so I can define the occurrence as a banded infinity.
Sigma is a denotation to the probability bands of something happening within a banded infinity (which means we never see 100%), 1-Sigma is encompassing of about 37% of the total spread from the median, so roughly 74% of all points (iirc, I don't use 1 sigma very often).

The AI that ran the test simulated a 2-Sigma clipping, so it accounts for around 47.5% of the total data banded from the median, so 95% of all the probabilities.

That leaves us with a top end 2.5% margin of error that it didn't even bother calculating, on an equation that is parabolic in nature. 
We can continue to explore that region by increasing our Sigma clipping and we'll never reach the end.
Enter the limit based calculus, we know it has to end somewhere, so where do we define that location? 
3-Sigma? 5? 20? The answer is that the peak is defined by huma- erm, ü¶ç factors.
We only hit the peak when apes decide enough üçå is enough üçå and start diddling themselves with the üçå that they made. 
So the stronger the ü¶ç greed, the higher the maximum uncapped value of the üçå.
Tl;dr: Hodl you beautiful ü¶ç you. ü¶çü§ùüí™üíéü§≤üöÄüåïüçåüçåüçå
Edit: 1-Sigma is a 34.1% spread of median

<h1>Who wants some Ice-Cream?</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/a9dkm2uzpvj61.jpg?width=595&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2132a9a677c4bfeec1b1ef8841f0634c9b13cf5e</p>
<p>So by this point we have all seen this tweet right?</p>
<p>while we have tried deciphering this as best we could with multiple theories I believe u/tiptoeintotown May have just cracked it.</p>
<p>To provide full transparency, we are both in a chatgroup and we sometimes bounce ideas off of each other in there and that's how this theory came to be.</p>
<p>Now the frog is considered as a figure of change, due to it's nature it starts as a tadpole and  changes from fully aquatic to being an amphibian frog.OR it can be reference to FROGGER.Going up and down, it's a game after all.</p>
<p>Now the letter M is usually seen as a sort of bounce or whatever, or the ice-cream resembles a rocket, but we think it's none of that.</p>
<p>Actually we think the story behind it is very simple, how many of you know the backstory of how Mcdonalds came to be?</p>
<p>The two brothers Mcdonald started the company but they wanted to keep it small but there was this one guy called Ray Kroc, he saw a lot of potential in it, he saw then what McDonalds could be right now. Something the brothers Mcdonald could not.</p>
<p>One of the main things was the ice cream machine, this thing was super expensive, but Ray found something around that. Powdered shakes. and I hear you thinking WTF does that have to do with Gamestop? hold on it will be clear in a sec.</p>
<p>He actually stole it from the real McDonald‚Äôs brothers by using the leverage he gained off on switching over to the ice cream tasty freeze product that the brothers refused to use because it brought the integrity of the product down. Lowering the cost of the electricity to keep the burner ice cream cold by switching to Tastee Freez gave Roy the access capital he needed to signal through the brothers that he had the leverage now to buy the land that the restaurant sat on and then release the land out to the McDonald‚Äôs Corporation. That‚Äôs how he was able to spread across the United States and make the foothold that he did as quickly as he did. He completely cut the brothers out.</p>
<p>We think, that this Ice-cream may be a reference to that.</p>
<p>Cohen is moving up as CEO, just like Mr. Kroc did.</p>
<p>They both have a vision of the company that the previous owners did not.</p>
<p>and the funny thing, this is also a reference to Cohens former company Chewy, where one of two slides was his team, enjoying some Mcdonalds soft serve Ice-cream.</p>
