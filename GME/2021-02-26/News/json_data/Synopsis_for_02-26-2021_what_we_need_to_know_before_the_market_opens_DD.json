But this is a quote from \"the art of war\" and it's something that has been used for business, war and everything else they can use it for.\n\nWe are hurting the hedge funds a lot, and you may think to yourself.... \"are we?\"\n\nYES! I've seen a post yesterday from Orthex stating that on Wednesday alone we where costing them 800+ million a day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/markets.businessinsider.com\\/news\\/stocks\\/gamestop-short-sellers-billions-losses-reddit-traders-wallstreetbets-rally-gme-2021-2-1030125873](https://preview.redd.it/q8j89k5yysj61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b256e0a02268488cc3470d6553492d4890c0ef9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwith losses so big would you not try everything to stop this? that's what we've seen yesterday. they bought a fuckload of Short options, this affects the underlying stock and artificially drops the price. Then they can sell all those borrowed shorts and the price drops even more.\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) You can see they borrowed 1 million more shares in a span of hours.\n\nusers have also made full threads explaining this and doing amazingly well\n\ncheck hem out here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lseast/2pm\\_drop\\_was\\_them\\_shorting\\_the\\_hell\\_out\\_of\\_xrt/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lseast/2pm_drop_was_them_shorting_the_hell_out_of_xrt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nand here\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lr33yp/etfs\\_containing\\_gme\\_average\\_daily\\_short\\_volume/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lr33yp/etfs_containing_gme_average_daily_short_volume/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Finra showing 33 million shorts lended yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/ou9516xjwsj61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=8637c376889bedf03fa46ccd24292e428c720ee9)\n\n(can't seem to find the image of Orthex stating it so if someone could perhaps give me a link I'll upload the image here)\n\nOk makes sense right?\n\nOk then let's go onto a little bit more technical aspects.

Remember we where only at $40 2 days ago, and then we shot up to 190 and back to 108 and at the time of writing in premarket we are at $123.THAT IS A 300% of the original price.\n\nThink about it, this stock is a rollercoaster, but no matter what happens we are up over a 100% in less than a day! and that's rare with normal stocks, but this motherfucker will go up even more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqerrk4vtsj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d0194896978fdd852efad0525ce4229a0e6412c\n\n# Call me maybe?\n\nOk so to a lot of people have trouble with ITM OTM Calls Puts etcI'd advise to check this guy out: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta9FfikSl9M&feature=youtu.be&ab\\_channel=StockMarketsWithBruce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta9FfikSl9M&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=StockMarketsWithBruce)\n\naround the 20 minute mark he gives a great explanation on how stuff works.\n\nwe have a fuck ton of calls on the table right now, and they're from 120 to 150 all the way up to 800, if these get triggered we could see a domino effect today and see this thing spiral out of control to top !\n\nEdit Caveat: I am in no way saying we should all buy the stock together, or coordinate a \"pump\" this is illegal and I do not endorse this in any way shape or form, just like DFV I believe in the stock and I believe in the underlying business. it is my personal belief that this company can turn around and be the next amazon, the squeeze is just an extra incentive for me personally\n\nBut there are a FUCKLOAD and I mean HOLY FUCK 150,674 ITM CALLS RIGHT NOW\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4o0bf95ysj61.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d230aec91c299946f5ef4a014d9df4206b748e3\n\nGo see u/Glowyhoein tread here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsta5r/a\\_total\\_of\\_150674\\_call\\_options\\_are\\_itm\\_currently/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsta5r/a_total_of_150674_call_options_are_itm_currently/)\n\nand this thread as well\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsmv1w/what\\_to\\_expect\\_for\\_friday\\_226\\_why\\_todays\\_price/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsmv1w/what_to_expect_for_friday_226_why_todays_price/)\n\n[the number of calls and when they are triggered, thanks to whoever posted this.](https://preview.redd.it/1fiocf6evsj61.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df8661ad7d01a30c09a53bdbe721db616d5ee0b)\n\nAs always expect the 10AM drop, this is like clockwork with these guys.\n\nand just a reminder, look at the end of January the numbers line up very nicely with whats happening in the past days.\n\n\\- January 25th: **Open: 96.73, high:159.18,** low: 61.13, **close: 76.79**\n\n\\- January 26th: **Open: 88.56**, high:150.00, low: 80.20, **close: 147.98**\n\n\\- January 27th: Open: 354.83, high: 380.00, low: 249.00, close: 347.51\n\nFor me this is very familiar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ngxf5ruxsj61.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dde80319550d551bc9f31fcb29c04a4b96a2276\n\n# SEC, 3 words middle is Elon\n\nAlso  [u/Ren3666](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ren3666/)  has earned an extra wrinkle in his noggin.\n\nOn the 25th of Feb the SEC has reduces the fees for Security transactions from $22.10 to $5.10 effective immediately.\n\nhow this affects everything is simple, this is a good hint that there will be a huge sell off of securities so that HF's can sell them to recoup losses from what they will lose and have lost with GameStonk right now.\n\ngo read his entire writeup right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lshpuj/25th_feb_breaking_news_sec_reduces_fee_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nHe explains it very well\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/elzeyvw1zsj61.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed0fa171c253f4af821e7ab9f57b9206d4957ae3\n\nNice lambo.\n\nAs u/maddao1 has posted\n\nwe need to relax a little bit.\n\nAll we need to do is relax, get greedy and remember to NOT PAPERHAND THIS BITCH.

That means 1 Lambo for every 2 shares, and you'll have extra money to spend on spraying huge ass fucking bananas on this sweet ride and still have cash left to get you a nice lambo.\n\nWhat do I base this on?on this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls78g7/why\\_the\\_130k\\_ai\\_is\\_wrong\\_and\\_why\\_thats\\_a\\_good/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls78g7/why_the_130k_ai_is_wrong_and_why_thats_a_good/)\n\nAnyone who has ever gotten statistics knows how this works.\n\nAnyone who hasn't leme give you a rundown, there is a 99.7 to a 100% chance we will be between 120k and 140k, there is a 95% chance that we will land between 110k and 150k and there is a 2.5% chance it will be bigger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So now it's time for my best little buddy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eku40uys0tj61.jpg?width=461&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=813de3a9752acb9f8e1aba140f070767d4060fc1\n\nRemember the HF morons think we will let this go for pennies on the dollar, but they underestimated our retard strength diamond grip we have.\n\nWe aren't going anywhere because we all know this mother fucker will get so high its amazing.\n\nThe thing is, these idiots are trying to get out of this situation the same way they got in, by keep shorting going.\n\nbut let me tell you something they don't understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[4 wongs don't make a wright](https://preview.redd.it/2ufjdfxa1tj61.jpg?width=1078&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b053a258011bd0cec3396cafd00250a84672865)\n\nwhy?\n\nlet me tell you a little tale of how normal trading works.HF shorts stock, people sell off and they can buy the stock for pennies on the dollar, because due to normal thinking a person would sell so they can recoup some of their losses.\n\nReddit trading:HF shorts stock, price drops and we get some nacho'sWhy nacho's? BECAUSE WE LOVE THE DIPWe don't have the normal thinking that the stock will drop to the bottom, because we have the mathematics on our side showing this is going to be a gamma squeeze at some point.So we don't panic, **AND WE HOLD!**\n\nThis is where the Diamond hands comes from, if the stock falls back down to 4 usd we wont sell because we know it will go back up, so we see this as nothing more than a sale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis fucks with the boomers minds so much, as they have never seen this happen before, normally people sell when it drops. but there is one fucking boomer that always bought when others sold.and you know who that guy is ?Warren FUCKING Buffet.\n\nThe best investor to have ever exploited the market.This guy is so god damn wrinkly brained its amazing\n\n\"Be fearful when **others** are greedy.

The answer is that the peak is defined by huma- erm, \ud83e\udd8d factors.\n    We only hit the peak when apes decide enough \ud83c\udf4c is enough \ud83c\udf4c and start diddling themselves with the \ud83c\udf4c that they made. \n    So the stronger the \ud83e\udd8d greed, the higher the maximum uncapped value of the \ud83c\udf4c.\n    Tl;dr: Hodl you beautiful \ud83e\udd8d you. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\n    Edit: 1-Sigma is a 34.1% spread of median\n\nEdit 4:\n\n# WHO IS UP FOR SOME GOOD NEWS?\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\n\nThe fee for borrowing shares just shot up from 1% to 12.5%Meaning what we did in 2 days (costing them 1.6 billion) now takes an hour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill not financial advice!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 5:\n\nu/heyitspixel did some great work.I couldn't even begin to summarize this one but I think everyone should read this.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsve5j/really\\_long\\_dd\\_and\\_analysis\\_what\\_happened/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lsve5j/really_long_dd_and_analysis_what_happened/)\n\nEdit 6:\n\nHas the Squeeze been Squoze? Nohttps://isthesqueezesquoze.com/\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 7:\n\n# Who wants some Ice-Cream?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9dkm2uzpvj61.jpg?width=595&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2132a9a677c4bfeec1b1ef8841f0634c9b13cf5e\n\nSo by this point we have all seen this tweet right?\n\nwhile we have tried deciphering this as best we could with multiple theories I believe u/tiptoeintotown May have just cracked it.\n\nTo provide full transparency, we are both in a chatgroup and we sometimes bounce ideas off of each other in there and that's how this theory came to be.\n\nNow the frog is considered as a figure of change, due to it's nature it starts as a tadpole and  changes from fully aquatic to being an amphibian frog.OR it can be reference to FROGGER.Going up and down, it's a game after all.\n\nNow the letter M is usually seen as a sort of bounce or whatever, or the ice-cream resembles a rocket, but we think it's none of that.\n\nActually we think the story behind it is very simple, how many of you know the backstory of how Mcdonalds came to be?\n\nThe two brothers Mcdonald started the company but they wanted to keep it small but there was this one guy called Ray Kroc, he saw a lot of potential in it, he saw then what McDonalds could be right now. Something the brothers Mcdonald could not.\n\nOne of the main things was the ice cream machine, this thing was super expensive, but Ray found something around that. Powdered shakes. and I hear you thinking WTF does that have to do with Gamestop? hold on it will be clear in a sec.\n\nHe actually stole it from the real McDonald\u2019s brothers by using the leverage he gained off on switching over to the ice cream tasty freeze product that the brothers refused to use because it brought the integrity of the product down. Lowering the cost of the electricity to keep the burner ice cream cold by switching to Tastee Freez gave Roy the access capital he needed to signal through the brothers that he had the leverage now to buy the land that the restaurant sat on and then release the land out to the McDonald\u2019s Corporation. That\u2019s how he was able to spread across the United States and make the foothold that he did as quickly as he did. He completely cut the brothers out.\n\nWe think, that this Ice-cream may be a reference to that.\n\nCohen is moving up as CEO, just like Mr. Kroc did.\n\nThey both have a vision of the company that the previous owners did not.\n\nand the funny thing, this is also a reference to Cohens former company Chewy, where one of two slides was his team, enjoying some Mcdonalds soft serve Ice-cream.\n\nEdit 8:\n\n# THE KING LIVES!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efxsjapk1wj61.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1a423580072861b7caada465c9bcd979a09bf5b\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt7v4w/gme\\_yolo\\_monthend\\_update\\_feb\\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt7v4w/gme_yolo_monthend_update_feb_2021/)\n\nhe is still in!",
