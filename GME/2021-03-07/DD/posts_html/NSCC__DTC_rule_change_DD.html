<p>CORRECTION: THIS RULE WILL NOT GO LIVE UNTIL 10 BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING THE SEC'S APPROVAL!!</p>
<p>Please note this is my first attempt at DD and it may be full of errors. Where I mess up, please let me know and I will amend as necessary.</p>
<p>Below I will attempt to make the content of the filing clear and understandable for a layperson and any assumptions you draw from it are your own. I am not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be financial advice. Do your own research before making any financial decisions.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, from what I understand the rule change this document provides is in relation to the handling of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits ("SLD").</p>
<p>What is SLD? Well from what I can work out, it's the fourth part to a rule the NSCC has to ensure they can settle the securities of it's members should they default. </p>
<p>This is a rule for all members and that list is very long and features the fan favourite, Citadel. It also includes those affiliated with it's members, charmingly dubbed 'families'. </p>
<p>Put simply, it's the NSCC and friends' way of ensuring they can complete settlements on behalf of it's members should their member default on their obligation for a security. It's kind of a way of ensuring the member can't just scream bankruptcy and pass the book to them for free, like a bank deposit on a mortgage for a house, except it's on their trading portfolio.</p>
<p>It's important to note this is not the only way the NSCC ensures settlement of securities. They have four ways they manage liquidity risk, namely the NSCC will:</p>
<p>I. Put in a cash deposit to their settlement fund to ensure no default;</p>
<p>II. Use what are essentially, short term I.O.Us in their other paper program as an alternative for payment;</p>
<p>III. Draw credit from a line of banks; and</p>
<p>IV. Use SLD. </p>
<p>All to ensure a trade settles. The SLD sum is usually equal to an estimate of what the NSCC couldn't cover using I.-III. above.</p>
<p>It's quite telling the beginning of this document sets out a comprehensive overview of liquidity risk management. Although it's relevant to the rule change, given the current context we find ourselves in, it's obviously possible this will be needed to protect them, or else why update the rule?</p>
<p>I digress - so what is the change? To understand the change it's best to know what the rules are currently. </p>
<p>At present, those members and affiliated parties of the members (Melvin anyone?) who grossed the largest debits would be required to pay SLD. I mention Melvin as they lost billions, and are certainly on the 'watchlist' of the NSCC at this point, or at least via Citadel are on the hook given Citadel's investment.</p>
<p>The NSCC previously calculated the requirements for SLD from members no later than 5 days prior to the options expiry activity periods - i.e on the whole the third Friday of each month, somewhere between 15th and 21st day of each month or every Friday. The next nearest and biggest, as we all know, is the quadruple witching day on 19 March.</p>
<p>To do this, they would review the trades of it's members over 24 months, calculate the 30 or fewer member's whose trades presented the largest liquidity risk over this time, and make them pay SLD proportionate to their calculated risk by no later than 2 days prior to the expiry of the options - i.e. the 17th March in this case. </p>
<p>Provided all goes well, the SLD sum would be returned 7 days later. If it doesn't, the SLD sum is used to ensure that member's obligation is fulfilled by the NSCC. They reserve the right to increase this sum at any point if that member's risky behaviour requires it and they can hold it for 90 days. Further, the member is also allowed to make a special deposit into the cash fund (i.e. rule I. above) if they expect their exposure to be greater than what the NSCC has determined (as if they would).</p>
<p>Instead, the NSCC now wants to calculate the requirements for SLD from members EVERY DAY and to make this calculation much simpler. Rather than attempting to guesstimate the sum they would require in excess of the NSCC's capital, based on 24 months history around only the options date, they will instead just take the sum of their risk each day, minus their available capital and what's left over the member has to pay as a deposit. Whilst it sounds simple, this could account for billions of dollars being unavailable to those members who say, I don't know, are billions in the hole on a short position.</p>
<p>This is made in direct response to an acknowledgement that their member's day trades can cause just as much fuckery to them as options expiring. Again, how many billions have been lost outside the options dates? I can't be bothered to look, but it's a lot.</p>
<p>The change therefore would put those same 30 or less members on the watchlist, except this time the NSCC would calculate their members (and thereafter the NSCC's) exposure to the risk of their trades on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The proposed change would also allow them to send the SLD back the next day, instead of holding it for 90 days, which may assist liquidity in the market. But we don't care about that.</p>
<p>As a theoretical example, the NSCC would be able to turn to someone like Melvin and say hey buddy, you're on the hook for what we calculate is a price spike up to $100 today whilst you're short at $4 x 500k shares. Please therefore pay us $96 x 500k as insurance, thx. Oh and you have to make this payment within 1 hour of notice too, but don't worry we'll notify you an hour before the market opens (this part is actually in the document).</p>
<p>If this exposure to liquidity was in the region of $2 billion for 2 or more members, the sum required would increase proportionate to the risk and could be sought collectively from those members who are determined to be fucked. This seems to be deliberate in that it definitely could leave those identified as fucked with literally no free cash for that day. Whilst it's never happened before, I wonder why they have decided to create a special provision for such a risk?</p>
<p>Further, if a member decides to retire the NSCC reserves the right to hold the demanded SLD of the day for 30 days. No easy outs here.</p>
<p>The above changes, provided there are no rebuttals, will be effective in 10 business days, or, you guessed it, the 19 March 2021.</p>
<p>AMENDMENT: credit to u/thilianii who spotted at page 58 this rule may come into effect as late as 60 days post expiration or even a further 60 days following that, should a request for further information raise novel or complex issues. This change may yet be a while off, but it relies on the SEC kicking up a stink. If they don't, this could happen before the quadruple witching date.</p>
<p>What this seems to me is the NSCC wants an immediate heads up in advance of a member shitting the bed and going bankrupt (or almost, hi Melvin); so they can take a fair slice of their money to protect themselves, rather than only finding out on a random Friday once a month.</p>
<p>The NSCC is essentially checking it's garden for dog shit every day instead of guessing when to based on a history of 24 months shitting. To continue the metaphor, the statistical amount of checks may be right most of the time, but doesn't account for diarrhea, does it?</p>
<p>But how does this affect GME? This change feels like a reaction. Hedges got caught with their pants down and the NSCC knows damn well it's next in line if they go bust and this change serves to protect them. The very fact this change has been proposed tells me some shit is about to go down and the NSCC doesn't want to give those responsible a way out without taking a chunk from them first.</p>
<p>The other impact is that 1 hour before open a member who has designs on short attacking the stock for that day whilst they eat their caviar may suddenly have a majority of their liquid funds stripped from them and held by the NSCC. Less money to play games with may tip the scales on the supply and demand, and could well provide a catalyst for a price surge.</p>
<p>Oh sorry I forgot you can't read ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>Edit 1: Unfortunately because I lurk I don't have sufficient karma to comment so I'll put some responses here.</p>
<p>To the person who said Melvin can't have SLD drawn from it, check page 7 of the filing which states anyone associated with a member are considered an affiliate family and are therefore liable for potential SLD. This is very open for interpretation legally and I'd say a company investing $2bn in your company for a stake is affiliated. If I'm wrong I will change.</p>
<p>To the person who asked why 19 March, page 19 of the filing specifically states that without rebuttal it'll go ahead  in 10 Business Days which is legal jargon for 14 days not counting weekends. I'm interested you state 60 days for approval, US law is outside my jurisdiction - is there a minimum approval period of this amount? The document states the later of these two days so if this is in place I'll amend the post, please direct me.</p>
<p>Finally to the person asking who would make the objection, the filing is made to the SEC. As this is outside my expertise I'm unsure who could rebut the change but it's likely those who would be affected - i.e. the members such as Citadel Securities so this has a high chance of being delayed.</p>
<p>Edit 2: credit to u/Rellicus who sums my post up nicely and provides a TLDR as follows: </p>
<p>TLDR: Market is regulating itself because the big fish know the gov isn't going to be able to bail them out if GME goes light speed.</p>
<p>Shorter TLDR: Market is butt clenched</p>
