<p>Disclaimer: This is not financial advise. Do your own DD before making any decisions. I am not a financial advisor. I'm just a guy and this is my analysis of the data. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR: The Deep ITM Calls are actually Melvin, Shitadel and friends using them to conceal FTDs</strong></p>
<p>I think I've finally put the pieces together. I've been looking at the option data for weeks now, and it's finally starting to make sense. The SEC has literally given us their playbook also. </p>
<p><strong>The first transaction : "Reversal"</strong></p>
<p>If you already understand synthetic longs and how it can be used to conceal short interest, you can skip to part two. For everyone else: Let's rewind all the way back to Jan during the first gamma  squeeze. HFs got shook that everyone noticed the 140% short interest on GME and needed a way to make it appear as though they covered without actually covering. Enter the reversal transaction. This is described in the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf">SEC memo</a> on page 7. For those that don't want to read it goes like this: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Melvin:</strong> <em>Hey Shitadel, I need to make it look like I covered but I'm not trying to buy shares. Got any ideas?</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Shitadel:</strong> <em>Hmm we can give you a synthetic long position, they aren't actual shares, but you can use it to report a net even position since you're short the real shares and long these synthetic options.</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Melvin:</strong>  <em>How does that work?</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Shitadel:</strong> <em>Write me a $1 Put for 100 shares. That means you're obligated to buy 100 shares when the price goes &lt;$1. I'll give you the premium $1 and you give me $100 collateral.</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Melvin:</strong> <em>Gotchu!!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't go exactly like that, but hopefully you get the point. </p>
<p>Where's the evidence for this? There's an obscene number of puts  with strike &lt;$5 that only started showing up after Jan 22 and I go thru all the evidence for this in my post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li7tfi/were_gme_shorts_covering_between_jan_22_and_jan_27/">HERE</a>. Other users have done some great DD to estimate the number of synthetic long positions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lil1c7/a_very_simple_but_very_convincing_reason_that/">HERE.</a></p>
<p><strong>The second transaction: "Reset"</strong> </p>
<p>Time passes while apes and retail continue to buy more and more shares. This leads to FTDs that need to get closed out, otherwise shorters won't be allowed to short any more. Enter the reset transaction. Basically this allows them to close the FTD, without actually buying shares. This is literally outlined in the same <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf">SEC memo</a> on page 8. For those that don't want to read it goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*FTDs hit their close out date*   </p>
<p><strong>Shitadel:</strong> <em>Yo Melvin, we gotta close out those FTDs if we want to keep shorting this shit.</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Melvin:</strong> <em>Yo I'm really not trying to buy shares right now. Is there anything else we can do?</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Shitadel:</strong> <em>Give me that lame printer you got, since I'm an MM, I'm allowed to use it to print out some synthetic shares.</em>   </p>
<p><strong>Melvin:</strong> <em>And then what?</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Shitadel:</strong> <em>After that, you buy these new prints and write me a deep ITM call (so I know it's you). I'll buy it and exercise it right away, which means you gotta give me those prints back. Once I get the prints back I'll just trash them and we're net even.</em>   </p>
<p><strong>SEC:</strong> <em>Oh say word, it looks like Melvin bought some shares, I don't know if it's legit but I guess we'll just clear those FTDs from our checklist now since that's the easiest thing to do *shrugs*</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence for this: All the Deep ITM calls that are being purchased consistently from floor trades at the PHLX exchange over the last week <strong>without any change in Open Interest</strong>. With the small trade count on these options, this is only possible if the options are being purchased and executed at the same time. I go over the data for this in detail in my post <img alt="HERE" src="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lyxixi/evidence_of_naked_calls/" /> when I originally thought it was a sign of naked calls.</p>
<p>The "whale" being praised for these deep ITM calls is likely none other than the HFs/MMs themselves and they're not even actually buying them, they're just kicking the can down the road.  </p>
<p><strong>What does this all mean?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short Interest data is incomplete and maybe way higher than what we understand. There's no way to accurately estimate without knowing how much retail holds, which is too hard to estimate and might actually be significant considering the amount of time that's passed since January,</li>
<li>FTD data is incomplete. With the reset transaction, they can make it appear as the FTD is cleared without actually clearing it at all. This doesn't even get into all the ETF shorting schemes that other's have DD on. </li>
<li>If we want to see whether shorts are covering, one reliable way might be to observe the puts with strike &lt;5$. As soon as we see OI on those beginning to decrease, we <em>may</em> be able to say that shorts are covering i.e. bears turning into bulls. </li>
<li>The squeeze is almost certainly not squoze in my opinion. The can has simply been kicked down the road again. It's highly improbable that shorts were covering on the first gamma squeeze with the observable activity I've described in my first post. It's also highly improbable that they covered on or after the second gamma squeeze because there would be no need for the reset transactions if that were the case. </li>
</ul>
