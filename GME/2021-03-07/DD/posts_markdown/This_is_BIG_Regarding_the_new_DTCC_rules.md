At least I hope it is, as I understand it. Basically, when a notice is sent by the NSCC under this revision, the funds must be deposited within **1 HOUR!**

From page 37:

>Each Supplemental Liquidity Provider that has a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation on a Business Day would receive a notice from NSCC of the amount of its Supplemental Liquidity Obligation and would be required to make a deposit in that amount to the Clearing Fund within one hour of such notice. The proposed timing of funding a Supplemental Liquidity Obligation would mirror the current requirement that is applied to Members’ Required Fund Deposits, which is also calculated and collected daily, and **must be funded within one hour of demand.** Specifically, NSCC expects to deliver notification of Supplemental Liquidity Obligations to Supplemental Liquidity Providers by around 8:30 AM ET each Business Day, with deposits required by no later than 9:30 AM ET.

So basically.. When they give notice, they want their money and they want it NOW! Everything I've read about these changes so far indicate that they're gonna make sure the Hedge Funds will be the first to pay our tendies. 

They made their bed, and now these new rules are going to ensure they lay in it. This is looking to me like it may well be the catalyst that launches this rocket. If these new rules get approved this week, especially on Monday or Tuesday... Y'all better strap the fuck in! We going on a trip in our favorite rocket ship!

**Keep in mind that I'm just a retarded ape. This is just my opinion and I could very well be wrong.**

But please, if I'm wrong about anything, correct me. The last thing I want to do is spread misinformation. And as always, remain patient!

Nobody can put a definitive timeline or price on this. If nothing comes from this, we just do what we always do: Buy and hold! The tendies will come eventually, and stimmys will soon be on their way. 🌈🐻 are fuk!

TL;DR for the apes who can't read: 💎🙌🚀🌚🦍💪👫🖍🍌

And as always: $100k+ is NOT a meme! We CAN get that and even more if everyone just HOLDS. Trust in your fellow apes. The squeeze should last long enough to give everyone plenty of time to make their own decisions without being rushed, so don't panic when the time comes! Patience is key, just as it has always been.

See you all on the moon! 😁
