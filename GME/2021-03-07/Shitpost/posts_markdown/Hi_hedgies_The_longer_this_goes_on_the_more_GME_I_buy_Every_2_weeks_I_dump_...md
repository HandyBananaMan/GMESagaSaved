68 shares now (yah I know, 1 off). I originally got in @ $90. My high was $240 for 5 shares. I didn't sell at $480 because I believed in the 10k meme. In Feb, that meme became 100k. On the way down from $480, I bought the dips. I bought another 20 shares when it hit the $40 dip. When it started rising, I bought some more last week just shy of $100. I still got plenty of cash in my checking as well as my rainy day fund. Come Monday, I'm converting into bum mode - ramen and water diet - and I plan on buying 20 more shares Monday. I don't give a single shit anymore. Every single penny I have available goes into GME. The longer you drag this out, the harder it will get on you.
