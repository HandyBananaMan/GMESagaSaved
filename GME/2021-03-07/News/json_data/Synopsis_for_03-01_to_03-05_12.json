Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and viewed as likely to take aggressive steps to regulate big business.\n    \n    Background:\n    -Chopra \n    worked as a consultant at McKinsey before helping Warren set up the CFPB in 2011. \n    He went on to serve as the agency's assistant director \n    \"student loan pointman,\" before his nomination to the FTC in 2018.\n    \n    -Gensler \n    was a partner at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for 18 years before joining the Treasury Department in 1997. \n    He was nominated by President Obama in 2008 to serve as chairman of the \n    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where he earned as a reputation \n    as an aggressive regulator and Wall Street foe.\n    \n    The big picture: \n    Biden is going to attempt to chart an economic policy that's visibly to \n    the left of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \n    If he succeeds, it's going to show up not only in taxes and spending, \n    but also in regulation.\n\n Ok so my take away from this is very simple, we have all been wondering why the hell the SEC is has not been doing anything, I think that if the above is indeed correct it may be the reason that we have not seen them do anything yet.\n\nThe transition may be one of the reasons this has taken more time.\n\nthe guys there don't have full autonomy to go after whatever they want, they have to run everything up the chain to the guys up top to say it's ok and then it can be done but if the guy at the top no longer gives a fuck because he has known (apparently this has been known since January) that he wont be there for another month, or because it's he's not doing enough that got them replaced in the first place.\n\nNow Caveat time; I have noticed people speak of politics of which side they align with and saying this is bad just because it's being done by someone who is not in your political alignment.\n\nsee it as a national sports team, sure it's not your personal home team, but the national team is your national team representing your country. so root for your national team in the tournament.  \nForget for a sec that there are 10 players from 10 different local teams, because that's not what it's about right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  March 19th and $130k?\n\nSo we have seen enough about march 19th being a likely date when the Tendieship will be launching near then.\n\nBUT these aren't facts, these are opinions based on data saying it will most likely be around that day, this means that it may not be right then and there, but it's more likely to be around mid to end march.\n\nAlso I've been inundated with DM's of what the date and ceiling of price will be.\n\nLet me be clear, WE DONT KNOW!\n\nThis is some serious Nostradamus level questions but it's all conjecture, we don't know when the moment is here until it's actually here and the peak is here.\n\nBut the fact that a lot of people themselves have found prices from 100k to 140k per share is telling me that these may be numbers we need to keep in mind.\n\nWe can guess by using math's, or by looking at all the things on the calendar (with puts calls etc), and that will give us some sort of an idea but Wen Moon but it won't give us an exact date or price. If we could do this. So lets go over some simple stuff that may give us some idea why I personally think it will be around that date  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xgvbdmybll61.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=343bb4c7d89cc28c4f86864baffb35052be1b209\n\n \n\nMarch 20th; World frog day \n\nMarch 20th; 25-cent ice cream cones at McDonald's during International Day of Happiness\n\nthe ice-cream cone can also be a reference to Ray Kroc how he took over as CEO in a very tricky way. (go watch the movie the founder). Mr. Kroc had a vision for McDonalds to become bigger than the current owners ever imagined, much like Cohen has a great vision for what GME can become. Less brick and mortar but a healthy mix between normal stores and a Amazon for games.\n\nI've seen posts here on that people ordered stuff from GameStop online and have it delivered in an hour or 2, because GME is using the local stores as a delivery hub and having Doordash deliver them to local customers. this is only one thing of course but its just a very imaginative way to fix a fast delivery system.\n\nIt can also be a reference to this part of the big short:\n\n[https://youtu.be/YoEbj5KkWG0?t=88](https://youtu.be/YoEbj5KkWG0?t=88)\n\nYou get the sundae Vinnie (the soft serves are called Sundae's in Europe)\n\nAlso if what I've read so far is correct most CEO's will step down or new ones step in with the release of the quarterly profit reports. And GME's earnings report is expected before the 25th of march.\n\nso this leads me to personally believe that it can be happening around the 19th and the 25th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BDE from Deepfucking value](https://preview.redd.it/2daa6v04cll61.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bd83810080c956dc4fd6bce0085af91fb4fbfc)\n\nHe is still in and if you don't see an update from him don't worry, there is no need to give an update if NOTHING has changed for him.\n\n \n\nRemember, we have seen bots, shills trolls and everything in between in the past month, don't for a second think we are in the clear at all.\n\nWe will see them double down, we will see red days, we will see people spread FUD and fake or bad DD. So do yourself and me a favor, don't take anything at face value, always double check everything. 2 people can look at the same data and come to different conclusions, so always check their work!\n\neven everything I post, double check it, and make your own opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Official Hearing date\n\n**March 17 at 12:00 PM ET:** The full Committee will convene for a virtual hearing entitled, \u201cGame Stopped?

She helped establish the world-class customer service operation that positioned Chewy to achieve a Net Promoter Score of 86 in 2018. In her new role, Ms. Durkin will oversee all customer service and engagement initiatives at GameStop.\n* **Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment** \u2013 Mr. Krueger, who previously held senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC, has a start date of March 1, 2021. In his new role, Mr. Krueger will oversee the management of e-commerce fulfillment centers.\n\nWell with little news worthy going on lets focus on GameStop itself today, a more fundamental look at who's who and why I personally believe, the current price may still be very low for what GameStop will be in less than a year.\n\nThis is partially also because we have been called idiots and morons and have a cultish sentiment when it comes to $GME. so lets get back to some of the basics, on why I believe in the company regardless of a squeeze or not.\n\n# What was gamestop?\n\nGameStop used to be your run of the mill company.\n\nThey bought videogames and sold them, also gaming memorabilia like mugs, shirts, books etc.\n\nAs far as I can tell, it was mostly in shopping malls in the usa, shopping malls are kind of a dying breed in and of themselves at this point (even pre covid these things where half empty from what I can remember).\n\nWhy GameStop was good then;\n\n* Most of us grew up as gamers so we have some sort of sentiment to GameStop\n* GameStop was one of (if not THE) first one to do the buy back of used games.\n* World wide reach, most companies are only in one country but GME is all over the world, something only a few stores can say\n* most people without even some form of sentiment to GME will at least go to GameStop once a month, to either go with friends or because of the preorder bonusses\n* GameStop Powerup Rewards memberships, you collect points per item bought which gives you a coupon, this incentivizes the customers to become more frequent shoppers and return to the store. Because why buy somewhere else? if you buy it at GME you'll get a discount if you buy enough. This is also something that a lot of other companies (video game retail) has since picked up (even C list companies in Europe now have some sort of thing like this just to compete)  \nIn one of his original videos on the subject, DFV mentioned the GameStop rewards being a great thing for the company because of just the sheer number of people who were signed up for it. I think its worth looking back at that video from so long ago if we\u2019re talking about fundamentals. DFV mentions doing research into general magazine readership and how Game Informer (which is bundled with the rewards membership) had a reader base in the top 5 of all magazines in the US. Specifically he points out being surprised that more people supposedly read Game Informer than Time Magazine as well as a lot of other notable publications. This points to a large customer base that has incentives to return to GameStop for those points and discounts.\n* started Decentralizing the stores, so it's not just mall only anymore.\n* started transitioning to become a hub (readable in their 2019 annual report)\n\n# Why GameStop wasn't good then;\n\n* CEO Sherman is a great guy, but he does not understand the digital playing field, this man is known for his other businesses like autoparts store, target, best buy etc not companies known for having a digital footprint.\n* It had to many stores that where not profitable and these cost money. the overhead was costing more than what they where bringing in\n* Even though the market had changed, GameStop failed to do so. it did not adapt.\n* It wasn't selling a lot of games, why? no clue maybe a smarter someone can tell me.\n\n[Annual shareholder letter 2019](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/9d2139e1-31c7-498f-ad95-63db1e6d085a)\n\n# So what has changed since 2019?\n\nWell lets take a look at all the things they have changed since then to get a better idea of what we are currently dealing with, and why I think that these changes have changed the company for good.\n\n1. They added Reggy \"My body is ready!\" Fils-Aim\u00e9 the Nintendo guy He likes to turn companies around is added to the board in 2019 . This man is invaluable, not only is he great at marketing he has enough connections to help the company move forward\n2. GameStop announces multiyear strategic partnership with Microsoft, [Details here.](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/)\n3. Replaced the CFO, regardless of how you look at it Jim Bell (end) was not good at his job, he has run multiple companies into the ground (like Pf changs and Coldwater creek) so having him replaced is a very good thing in my book, as he does not seem well equipped to handle the transition GME is going to go through.\n4. The new additions to the board, Cohen, Kreuger, Attal, Grube and Durkin. I'll do a quick TLDR on all of them here:- **Ryan Cohen** is the manager of RC Ventures and a sizable stockholder of GameStop Corp. Mr. Cohen previously founded and served as the Chief Executive Officer of Chewy Inc. (NYSE: CHWY), where he oversaw the company\u2019s growth and ascension to market leadership in the pet industry. Mr. Cohen led the company through its successful sale to PetSmart Inc. for more than $3.3 billion prior to stepping down in 2018. The company is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange with an equity market capitalization of approximately $40 billion. Mr. Cohen has extensive experience in retail, technology and e-commerce.- **Alan Attal** is a successful e-commerce executive and entrepreneur with more than two decades of experience building and managing businesses. From 2017 through 2018, Mr. Attal served as the Chief Marketing Officer of Chewy Inc. and oversaw an annual acquisition budget of more than $300 million, which was allocated to broadcast, direct mail and digital advertising and engagement initiatives. From 2011 through early 2017, he served as the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer and oversaw its expansion from three people to more than 10,000 employees and $3 billion in revenues.- **Jim Grube** is a successful business and finance executive with more than two decades of corporate experience. He was most recently the Chief Financial Officer of Vacasa, North America's leading vacation rental management company. He previously served as the Chief Financial Officer of Chewy, Inc. from 2015 through 2018. He was formerly the Senior Vice President of Finance at Hilton from 2009 through 2015 and a Director of Finance at Amazon from 2007 through 2009. He began his career working at other leading companies across the technology and transportation sectors.\u00a0**Matt Francis** brings more than two decades of experience in e-commerce and consumer technology to GameStop. Most recently, he was an Engineering Leader at Amazon Web Services. He previously held senior-level technology roles at companies such as QVC and Zulily. At GameStop, Mr. Francis will be responsible for overseeing e-commerce and technology functions. For **Durkin** and **Krueger** see above.\n5. \\*\\*Cohen's vision of the company.\\*\\* In November 2020 RC Ventures (Cohens company) sent GameStop a letter which outlines his ideology on a \"technology first\" company. you can read it here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf)\n6. They have cut the fat from the stores, meaning they sold off, or did not continue leases of non profitable stores around the globe, meaning they saved around $ 100 million in overhead costs already.\n\n# So taking all these new things into account let's look at a few things we may have overlooked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yp0cghwidll61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d3aa6b37e7cd3e8cb763d4a413a5b5e712fb43a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0onf1dpjdll61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=1afc2b0d5df4c91fcbf7af5a975194d21280d127\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pon68qjldll61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b526694a6dd37832f98a3aaf20ecda5589cdc5\n\n \n\nwell this sounds cool right? these guys had a talk with our boy Cohen, which is awesome but... \"there may be some material non-public information in regards to Cohens strategy to GME \n\n\"Ok ok cool... so what do these guys think about GME?\n\nI mean Domo is not a bad company and they seem to be doing well, also they seem to be in contact with Ryan Cohen, meaning Ryan is smart enough to know he doesn't know everything and is asking for feedback in some way shape or form with these guys.\n\nOk so they have been in contact once right? no they have been multiple times, and they have given their thoughts on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccmfug0pdll61.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=a29d345ad136bf6ecd7e74ea94c64c441895b981\n\n \n\nNow one thing to take into account, they had a conversation about the fundamentals of the company, they wouldn't care about a squeeze as these people go for long. so lets learn something from them.\n\nAt this point it seems that GME is undervalued, even at a 100 bucks a share.  \nBy conservative measurements the company should be between 200/300 now (if the shorts were not on it it would be a very different price again just my opinion).\n\nCohen and Domo believe that the shares can go to $1000 each.\n\nSeeing the big steps Ryan is taking this may be something that may even be realized, they have now added PC components (an entirely new group as it only sold pc games before), Same day delivery, the deal with Microsoft, the moves they're making to include Esports as a core part of their business.\n\nThese are all things that will affect the stock, as GameStop around next summer, will no longer be the GameStop we have known for so long. We are going to see a whole new GME, a bigger and better one.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter if you believe in a squeeze or not, the things I have pointed out above are based on Fundamental changes in the company, and given those points I personally believe that the current Stonk is heavily undervalued.  \nMoving it from a brick and mortar store, to a \"Amazon\" like company WITH brick and mortar stores. The evolution Amazon never had the balls to do, but I would love to see. \n\n**edit: some users have pointed out that amazon does have a few retail stores, and is expanding on doing food related things.**\n\nWe are ever more growing into a society where our digital lives and regular lives come closer and closer. 10 years ago streamers where a laughing matter, now they're part of a lot of daily routines, E-sports was nothing more than Korean kids doing some hardcore Starcraft, now it's a lot of games (streetfighter tournaments, dota, LOL, Starcraft, csgo, fortnite etc etc) it was a niche, and it now is a multi billion dollar industry. an industry GME is planning on becoming a part of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# New FTD data is out.\n\nyou can download it here:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)\n\nI took the liberty of going fishing for you guys\n\n    20210201|36467W109|GME|10975|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|325.00 20210202|36467W109|GME|159298|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|225.00 20210203|36467W109|GME|47564|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|90.00 20210204|36467W109|GME|88767|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|92.41 20210205|36467W109|GME|27307|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|53.50 20210208|36467W109|GME|304|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|63.77 20210209|36467W109|GME|22796|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|60.00 20210210|36467W109|GME|99|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|50.31 20210211|36467W109|GME|1534|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|51.20 20210212|36467W109|GME|15102|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|51.10 \n    \n    20210201|78464A714|XRT|1135221|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|88.01 20210202|78464A714|XRT|1555661|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|82.95 20210203|78464A714|XRT|485989|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|76.14 20210204|78464A714|XRT|79564|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|77.42 20210205|78464A714|XRT|9352|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|77.16 20210208|78464A714|XRT|216633|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|78.86 20210209|78464A714|XRT|108238|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|80.07 20210210|78464A714|XRT|44834|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|79.64 20210211|78464A714|XRT|1712|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|79.58 20210212|78464A714|XRT|44278|SPDR SERIES TR SPDR S&P RETAIL|80.01 \n\nOk now for the smooth brain explanation.\n\nFTD is cumulative, meaning the total at the latest date means how many are outstanding, they don't add up like the mistakes in my life.\n\nMeaning for GME as of 2021-02-12 there are 15.102 shares outstanding with a price of $51.10\n\nfor XRT at 2021-02-12 there are 44.278 shares outstanding at a price of $80.01\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r39e6389ell61.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=addaca0fb16566b715dac981e8ce67fd7805ba27\n\n# FUD\n\nLet's introduce our best little buddy again\n\n(seriously I love this picture so much I printed it and put it on a pillow next to me)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzzdba0dell61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=be79c454cd523520f34e3daf1db6259dd12f506e\n\n \n\nWe have been seeing an increase in Bots shills and Trolls on this sub.\n\nThat's awesome, that means we are doing something right!\n\nAgain why spend money to hire a small army to spread FUD if they didn't stand to lose a big part of their cash?

Meaning you will see a red day with loads of shills posting shit like \"its OvEr SeLl nOw!!!\" because they are worried what we do with our money.... right, ever had anyone say they're worried over your money? if so you have some weird ass friends.\n\nAnyway, chill you'll learn to love the Red, we only had red days since the 28th of January, and we will see some more of those before it's over. just learn to love the dip.\n\nOr as this sub sees it \"discounts\"\n\nAnd just for the Shills trying to get my Shekels away from me, this is the current data compared to the prev mini squeeze, notice anything?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nh7l53gsell61.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=d514ffd5994e21be294cc3ca1c1520ca2ae808d6\n\n Coming full circle.\n\nsmart ape [u/dookiebuttholepeepee](https://www.reddit.com/u/dookiebuttholepeepee/) (I love how the meme has become full circle of melvin getting banged by users named bigdaddydongus and dookiebuttholepeepee)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbqr3kztell61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e78c6b44c864395ed81a2841dbcadaf50e2761\n\n \n\nIt seems that the overal downwards trend is meeting the upwards trend.\n\nnow lets zoom out a bit more... what if there is a second cup being made at the $350/$400 mark? we'd be literally be launching into alpha centauri at some mach speed shit.\n\nFor the people not sure what I mean, this is what I'm referring to:\n\n[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart\\_analysis:chart\\_patterns:cup\\_with\\_handle\\_continuation](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart_analysis:chart_patterns:cup_with_handle_continuation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look from far enough you'll see that GME is actually hitting that cup/ handle shape on point.\n\nit has been said \" **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks.\"\n\nGiven this we can see the handle form within the next few weeks. could be in the next week or at the end of march.
