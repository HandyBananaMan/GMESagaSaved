Does anyone else find it incredibly irritating and insulting that this boomer is sitting in the Bahamas telling us not to invest our stimmy in GME? The audacity of this bitch.

EDIT: GME to the fucking moon. Not gonna listen to this trash tell me how to spend my stimmy. Tesla or nothing for me. 

Not financial advice as I am not currently in the Bahamas.
