PERIOD.\n\nDOWNVOTE all these kind of posts and REPORT them. Don\u2019t give them fuel with comments and upvotes. There\u2019s no \u201cWE\u201d in investment. \n\nEvery day they try new strategies, including gathering your personal info, positions, etc. Downvote and report these shill posts.\n\nEDIT:\n[The agenda is real. This is what I mean](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzzi1m/we_need_to_stop_worrying_about_collaboration/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nEdit 2:\nAbove post links to a[forbes article from Feb 4 ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebrumberg/2021/02/04/reddit-and-gamestop-lessons-former-sec-enforcement-chief-explains-stock-manipulation-and-how-to-avoid-trouble/?sh=3bbdfce28590)  telling people it\u2019s perfectly safe to manipulate markets together at specific times. How convenient.\n\nEdit 3:\nThis isn\u2019t about anyone getting convicted, it\u2019s about them having a scapegoat. Especially at the congress hearings, where they would blame retailers for grouping up to move and manipulate the stock, which isn\u2019t and never been the case!! This is about not giving them ANYTHING to blame for their greedy retarded ass betting more money in a casino than they can afford.",
