After their new regulations go into effect another short squeeze of ANY MAGNITUDE will be nearly IMPOSSIBLE!!

What does this mean? 

It means MILK THIS FOR EVERYTHING POSSIBLE! $1MIL MINIMUM!! The DTCC is already beginning to cover their asses by trying to make sure they are absolutely the last ones that are affected by this. But that isn’t possible. Everyone WILL be affected by this! 

So what needs to happen to make the most of the squeeze? 

HOLD DAMMIT!!!!
Have a price point in mind but have that be your STOP LIMIT NOT YOUR LANDING ZONE! Ride this rocket for as long as possible! 

When this is all in the history books and all the data previously hidden becomes available to the public, no one should say “Damn I should have held for longer.” Instead it should be “I WAS THERE AT THE TOP!!”

(Obviously not financial advice. My skull is 4x thicker than everyone else’s)
