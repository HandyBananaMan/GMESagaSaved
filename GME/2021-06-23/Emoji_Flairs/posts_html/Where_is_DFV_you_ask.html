<p>DFV was very active on Twitter up until last week dropping easter eggs from famous movies, paintings and sometime just gold class memes with no hidden meaning. His last tweet was this: <img alt="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1406054126555967495" src="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1406054126555967495" /> possibly indicating that he is going to rest and take some time off of Twitter. This has been very similar to how he went quite after the congressional inquiry with the strong message that he still believes in the stock and will buy more.</p>
<p>It can be understood that the man has engaged top notch lawyers who are helping him navigate the media scrutiny alleging he has been the reason behind the MOASS. I believe DFV's reappearance and disappearance from Twitter is a carefully planned move authorized by his lawyers to publicly display and prove that the price moves regardless of his tweeting. This strategy should prove effective as saw we both, the high and low in the time period he was tweeting.</p>
<p>I am now eagerly awaiting his return for some Deep Fucking Memes and kitty cat videos!</p>
