<p>Wrinkle brains and reddit detectives, I need your help. Shifting all the blame onto Kenny (don't get me wrong, the memes are great) is a shill tactic to get us to ignore the culpability of MANY in the finance world and government. It is not just retail vs. Kenny. It is retail vs. an entirely fraudulent system propped up by many. So who else should we be looking into? Here are some non-HF organizations that seem to be complicit:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>DTCC Board of Directors: <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board">https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board</a>. Just noticed on their website their tax country is Switzerland?!! WTF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FINRA Board of Governors: <a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors">https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors</a>. From website: "FINRA is authorized by Congress to protect Americaâ€™s investors by making sure the broker-dealer industry operates fairly and honestly." LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEC Commissioners: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Article/about-commissioners.html">https://www.sec.gov/Article/about-commissioners.html</a>. Need to stop watching porn and get to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury Secretary: Janet Yellen (paid $810,000 to give speeches to Citadel)- <a href="https://twitter.com/SecYellen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">https://twitter.com/SecYellen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a>. Nobody really comments on her Twitter. This needs to change. We need more public exposure and pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal Reserve ("the Fed") Board of Governors: <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm</a>. Our founding fathers were strongly against a central bank, but to my understanding, Woodrow Wilson pushed for it as a way to print ourselves back to prosperity after WWI and to establish the dollar as the world reserve currency. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Board of Governors: <img alt="https://ir.theice.com/governance/board-of-directors-and-committee-composition/default.aspx" src="https://ir.theice.com/governance/board-of-directors-and-committee-composition/default.aspx" />. They operate exchanges and clearing houses, including the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are more out there. These links are just to the Boards, but the management teams of each of these organizations should be looked into as well. Don't let them pin all this on Kenny. Let's start digging deeper.</p>
