<p>Hello,</p>
<p>To anyone thinking of selling, you must know this was not the squeeze. In fact, the shorts took out an additional 1,000,000 shares short around 2 pm to keep the price down. Thatâ€™s right: the hedge funds are doubling down!</p>
<p>The cause of the price action was a margin call. When the value of your portfolio drops below your requirements, your broker will force you to liquidate at any price. This is because any debt left over is paid by the broker, who will not be left holding the bag bc you cannot calculate risk.</p>
<p>Why now? Probably the continued fees were eating away at the equity in the portfolio. Shorting is very expensive. Also, look at the price action across the market today and yesterday! A very common trade has been to short retail and long tech. With Tesla down so much and the rest of the sector lagging, that was probably enough to tip the scales into insolvency.</p>
<p>What to expect: 1) all of the shares that were covered could still be shorted by a larger institution, so price may drop to cause FUD. </p>
<p>2) the shorts capitulate and we continue on to the moon. In this case, prepare for trading to get halted again. </p>
