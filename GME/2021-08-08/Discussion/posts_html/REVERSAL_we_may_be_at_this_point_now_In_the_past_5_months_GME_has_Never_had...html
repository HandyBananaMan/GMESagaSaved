<h1>Title: REVERSAL, we may be at this point now. In the past 5 months, GME has Never had a WEEKLY Close below $150. March 5th was the last time that Friday close was 137.74. After that Rip, the price has stayed above $150 on every Friday even with hard dips to 116. To me that says 150 is the lowest we go. B&amp;H</h1>
