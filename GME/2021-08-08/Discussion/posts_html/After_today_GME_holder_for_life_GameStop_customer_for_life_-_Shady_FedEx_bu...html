<p>I ordered a Simulator cockpit (like a racecar chair for a racing sim setup)</p>
<p>It was shipped and FedEx shows delivered, however, it was not. </p>
<p>I reviewed camera feed for the time it shows FedEx delivered it and I see the truck but he drives right on by without stopping, 3 mins after the "delivery time."  My wife was home as well... The FedEx driver either stole it or delivered it to the wrong house (checked with neighbors, no one said they received it)  Mind you, this package was like 3 feet x 3 feet x 2 feet... large package. </p>
<p>I called GameStop's customer service and explained. They asked if I wanted a refund or replacement. I wanted a replacement and he responded, great, it will be there tomorrow before 8pm...  I was really confused as I was expecting to have to fight for a replacement or be told I had to deal with FedEx.... Nope, they took care of me!  Its easy to tell the customer to f'off. Its harder to do what's right and lose money...... They lost money today because of FedEx but their actions today will gain them 100x more business from me because of it. Good ROI for them if you ask me!</p>
<p>I asked if they wanted me to provide them with the video of the driver driving by without stopping and they said not to worry... </p>
<p>This is what I am talking about.... This is customer service. THIS "is the way"</p>
<p>XXX holder, not just for the squeeze, but because I LOVE the stock.... </p>
<p>GME holder for life. GameStop customer for life.</p>
