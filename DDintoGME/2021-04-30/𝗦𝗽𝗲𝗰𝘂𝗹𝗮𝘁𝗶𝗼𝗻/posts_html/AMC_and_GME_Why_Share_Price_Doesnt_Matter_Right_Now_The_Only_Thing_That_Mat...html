<p>Repost with numerous revisions from the more wrinkle brained of our bretheren. Thank you commentors on my post in r/DDintoGME who helped me edit this post.</p>
<p>This is my very first DD, so please give some leniency on the formatting/flow. I decided to post this to make sure people understand where we are and why the only thing that matters at this point are the OTCC, NSCC, and DTCC rules. What do we know from them? How do they better inform when we could possibly see the beginning of the squeeze?</p>
<p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER: I am not suggesting in any way that the dates I am about to discuss are definitive dates for the start of the squeeze. Nor am I saying that these are make or break dates. Nothing changes for each individual ape, we buy and hold. The squeeze can happen sooner, the squeeze could happen later. There are a bunch of extenuating factors that affect when we squeeze. Even with all of these rulings in place, the NSCC, OTCC, DTCC, and SEC need to enforce them to make a difference. You know, the same corrupt regulatory agencies that allow blatant naked shorting daily? Yeah, the thesis below rests on them actually doing their job. Imagine that. Not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. You make your own decisions with your money. I just like these stocks and will buy and hold until I can't anymore.</em></strong></p>

<p>BEFORE YOU READ THE FOLLOWING, READ THE DD ABOVE. THESE FOUR POSTS ARE THE SINGLE MOST CRITICAL READS IF YOU ARE HOLDING OR THINKING OF BUYING. A LOT OF WHAT I REFERENCE BELOW COMES FROM THE GREAT DD ABOVE, AND I AM NOT GOING TO REPEAT OR QUOTE IT. THE USERS THAT POSTED THESE DESERVE THE VIEWERSHIP.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Based on the effectiveness dates laid out in the rulings to be discussed, the latest dates we can safely assume the rulings can all be in effect (with the exception of DTC-2021-005, which is still AWOL for now) is June 14, 2021. Once all of the rulings are in place, it would be a lot less complicated for the regulatory agencies to allow it to squeeze. Without the rulings, I am sure regulators would face legal action, and perhaps jail time. These rulings save their skin, and for that reason, I don't believe they want to let AMC and GME squeeze before June 14th.</p>
<p>the Setup:</p>
<p>In order for this squeeze to happen, the entities (Regulators, HFs, and MMs) need to allow it to happen. Right now, the sideways trading of these stocks is being controlled by these three players. Make no mistake, everything that is happening is coordinated and in place to minimize the damage this causes to the global market and it's primary players. That is the only way these stocks can be so heavily controlled and stable, how interest rates on short shares can be so low, and why we see huge volume in the dark pools,</p>
<p>Here are the mechanics behind how this is working right now:</p>
<p>1.) HFs shorting- Hedge Funds are shorting to keep the price from increasing. Aided by the MMs favorable short borrow free rate, the regulator's leniency (turning a blind eye), and also the lack of margin calls from MMs</p>
<p>2.) Market Makers Controlling Order Flow- MMs are currently working to keep the price in stasis while the regulations settle in place. They can do this by controlling where orders they receive are executed. The mechanism they use for that is dark pool trading. If an MM wants to keep the price down, they route buy orders through the dark pool. If they want to keep price up or let it run briefly, they move sell orders to the dark pool. All is meant to keep stasis.</p>
<p>3.) Regulators- The NSCC and DTCC regulators want to make sure that all of their members don't suffer huge losses to cover one member's large mistake. OTCC wants to be able to control how the liquidation of the over-leveraged HFs to ensure their holdings can be re-apportioned in a way that doesn't crash the economy. The SEC wants all of this to go away without federal investigations, litigation, and, quite frankly, jail time.</p>
<p>Regulators are the puppet-masters. They are directing the MMs and HFs on how to keep the SP stable. They are ensuring that they get the time they need to enact rules and regulations before this squeeze can shatter global markets. MMs are the Regulators muscle and deep pockets. They are providing the liquidity, order flow, and manipulation that keeps the price stable while the regulators get their ducks in a row. HFs are the court jesters and servants. The hole they've dug is so deep, they have zero power in how or when this squeeze happens. In order to even survive this, they must follow direction of the Regulators and MMs to avoid going out of business, facing litigation, and serving jail time. They are serving as court jesters by keeping the public distracted from the king standing behind them. We all vilify the HFS (rightfully so), and completely ignore what is going on behind the scenes (at least until atobitt brought this all together).</p>
<p>ALL THAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW IS FOR THE RULINGS AND REGULATIONS TO BE PUT IN EFFECT. WHEN THEY ARE, THE REGULATORY AGENCIES CAN ALLOW ANY HEAVILY SHORTED STOCK TO SQUEEZE. IF THESE WERE TO SQUEEZE WITHOUT THE REGULATIONS IN PLACE, THE HFS GO DOWN, THE MMS FOLLOW, AND THE REGULATORS DROP LAST. NOT SAYING THIS CAN'T SQUEEZE BEFORE THE RULES HIT THE BOOKS, BUT I GUARANTEE NONE OF THE ACTING PARTIES HERE, EXCEPT MAYBE THE HFS, WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.</p>
<p>So, what are the regulations that need to be in place before they open the flood gates? How do they all go hand-in-hand to provide regulatory control over the squeeze?</p>
<p>DTC-2021-002- Enhances the methodology for setting bank deposit investment limits based on the size of bank counterparties. Previously, the DTC limited maximum bank deposit investments based solely on external credit rating. DTC-2021-002 proposes to limit bank deposit investments not only on credit rating but also on size of the bank counterparty (as measured by equity capital). APE SPEAK: The DTC wants to protect its banking members, so it will now force them to reduce lending caps when lending to smaller counterparties.</p>
<p>DTC-2021-003- Increases frequency of position reporting to the DTCC. Adds fines for inaccurate or delayed reporting. APE SPEAK: DTCC can open the books of any market member at any time to examine just how deep into the sh*t they are.</p>
<p>DTC-2021-004- Increases oversight and liquidation capabilities of the DTC to protect all of it's members. Sets margin call limts for any member in a heavily over-leveraged position. Essentially, it is an insulator to an uncontrolled squeeze by allowing the DTC advise a liquidation of assets of an overleveraged member to minimize the over-leveraged positions' impact on the rest of the DTC's members. It also states that it will not "bail-out" a member who is in an over-leveraged position, which is HUGE. APE SPEAK: If hedgie shorts the f*ck out of a stock and finds itself trapped as share price rises, the DTCC can liquidate them to cover their positions and prevent it's other members from taking losses. In addition, hedgie that is f*cked is on their own. No safety nets.</p>
<p>DTC-2021-005- This is the biggie. This ruling prevents using synthetic shares created by deep ITM calls and married puts from being used to cover REAL short positions. It links any of these synthetic shares to the call or put that created them. APE SPEAK: No more synthetic shares to cover FTD obligations.</p>
<p>NSCC-2021-002(advance notice for which was NSCC-2021-801)- Maintains the Daily Liquidity Requirements of Hedge funds if the DTCC deems necessary (ties closely to DTC-2021-004 and 002). DTCC rules set the expectation, the NSCC rule declares the limit and enforcement of it. APE SPEAK: HEY HEDGIE, GET MARGIN CALLED.</p>
<p>OCC-2021-001: This ruling increases the maximum aggregate operational loss fee that the OCC would charge all of its clearing members in the even that equity of its members falls below certain thresholds defined in its Capital Management policy. The threshold is $250 million. In the event that the OCC's equity fell below $225 million, or stayed below $250 million for over 90 calendar days, the trigger event would occur. Under this ruling, each clearing member would then need to cough up a MAXIMUM of $1,337,072 per clearing member (assuming the amount of clearing members remains 1,007). If they could not remain above their minimum capital requirement after charging the max operational loss fees, the OCC would enact its recovery and wind down plan. Once complete, it would be obsolete. Seem like a coincidence that they decide to propose this ruling at the foot of what might be the greatest and final short squeeze the stock market might ever see? I think not. Ape speak: OCC sees a storm on the horizon. In order to stay afloat, they need to increase the amount of equity they have by taking some from their members. This gives them some buckets to scoop the water out. If the buckets don't get enough water out of the boat, the OCC sinks.</p>
<p>OCC-2021-002: This one was hard for me to crack, if I am being honest, but I think I have it figured out and will do my best to make it simple to understand. There are three main parts. Part 1: This ruling alters the way Derivative Clearing Organizations ("DCO) determine the minimum margin requirement for customers with higher risk accounts. In addition, it gives DCO's additional discretion to increase the minimum margin requirement for customers that have accounts with "heightened risk". In addition, this section removes language that allows distinct margin requirements for customer hedge and speculative positions. Part 2: This one hurts my head. Ready? So, in 2011, the CFTC adopted a regulation that required each DCO to prohibit DCOs from allowing customers to remove funds from their account unless the clearing member held enough assets to cover its margin requirement. In 2012, they revised this rule to allow the CFTC to treat separate accounts of a futures commission merchant (FCM) as separate entities. Part 2 of OCC-2021-002 creates an exception to the 2012 revision. From what I understand, and I would like some feedback here, this second part eliminates the ability of DCOs to treat FCM accounts as separate entities. If you are an FCM and you make a bad bet, you don't just lose the ability to withdraw from your account that has the bad bet, you lose the ability to withdraw from your entire FCM portfolio until you meet the margin requirement. Part 3: This one is mostly fun for us. It requires the OCC to publish a public notice when it decides to suspend a defaulting clearing member. However, it includes some nice legal jargon. It states that it must publish a public notice "as soon as reasonably practical." Coming from a law background, "reasonably practical" could mean 1 day or 1 year. All depends on who is determining practicality. APE SPEAK(How can I Ape speak this?): Part 1 increases minimum margin requirements for all DCO customers. Part 2 forbids DCOs from treating different accounts from the same FCM as different companies. If you make a bad bet in one section of your portfolio, they lock you out of the whole thing until you pay your margin requirement. Part 3 lets us know when a Clearing member is a bad boy.</p>
<p>OCC-2021-003- This is the ruling often abbreviated as "skin in the game". It's quite simple really. The OCC proposes, with this ruling, to make it obligatory upon itself to provide for the use of "in excess of 110% of it's Target Capital Requirement" in the event of a clearing member default. Previously, it was at the OCC board's discretion as to whether or not the OCC's funds would be used to cover the loss of a defaulted member. Taken straight from the ruling "In the event of a Clearing Member default, OCC would contribute excess capital to cover losses remaining after applying the margin assets and Clearing Fund contribution of the defaulting Clearing Member and before charging the Clearing Fund contributions of non-defaulting Clearing Members." Ape Speak: We are the OCC, and we stand by our non-defaulting members. We will liquidate the funds of a bad egg, and even our own funds before forcing our members to step up to the plate to cover the losses of one bad egg. (Gee, I wonder why Susquehanna would want to delay this one? I think we found our rotten egg)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>OCC-2021-004- This one fascinates me, and is perhaps the smoking gun of how everything here comes together. This ruling augments the procedures for an asset auction, and allows more parties to be involved in an asset auction. When the squeeze happens, it will almost definitely put some HFs out of business. They will default on countless short positions, loans, etc. When they go out of business, you can't just take their long positions off the market because that will crash the markets. So, what do you do? You auction them off to competitors. Competitors get shares at a discount, the regulatory agencies increase their liquidity to pay off the defaulted members debts, and the market doesn't crash. This ruling allows not only current members to bid at auction, but allows new members to be brought in with the referral of an existing party, or at the discretion of the OTCC. It increases the pool of liquidity that can buy off the shares and options of the defaulted member by bringing more players to the table. APE SPEAK: Hedgie dies out at sea, sharks smell blood and feast on remains. OCC-2021-004 brings more sharks to the feeding frenzy. Regulatory agency has less carcass to clean up.</p>
<p>SEQUENCING THE MOST CRITICAL REGULATIONS FOR THE SQUEEZE. THEIR EFFECTIVE DATES ARE CRITICAL. HERE'S THE SEQUENCE:</p>
<p>DTC-2021-003- In order to know just how f*cked up this squeeze is going to be, the DTCC needed to be able to see the books of the overleveraged parties.</p>
<p>DTC-2021-004- Once the DTC knows just how f*cked up the situation is, they need to be able to remedy it with as minimal damage to themselves and their signatories.</p>
<p>OCC-2021-004- Once the squeeze happens, regulatory agencies need to be able to settle the bankrupted HFs positions as quickly as possible to minimize damage to the markets. Hence adding more sharks to the feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>DTC-2021-002- Sets the expectations for collateral the HFs need to continue shorting. IMPORTANT: this rule can be in effect at passage but cannot be exercised until NSCC-2021-002 takes effect. This is critical to understand. Without the NSCC rule, the DTCC rule has no enforcement capabilities.</p>
<p>NSCC-2021-002(advance notice for which was NSCC-2021-801)- This is the big boy margin call. This needs to happen after the (4) above because without those (4), there could be a margin call, and then the pieces aren't in place to control the squeeze. I doubt the DTC would advise a margin call to the NSCC before everything was in place, so this might be able to shift around in the sequencing, but it would be better for it to come after to guarantee the pieces are in place. I would bet that the SEC wants this only after the previous (4)</p>
<p>DTC-2021-005- Once FTDs can't be covered with the long positions created by deep ITM calls and married puts, the hedge funds take their last breath. This is the catalyst that puts the squeeze into motion. This absolutely has to be the last one to go into effect. without question. It fundamentally changes how shorts can cover, and by doing so it forces the squeeze to start. Regulators can't stop it once this goes into effect, which is why the need the previous rulings to control it before it hits the ledger.</p>
<p>THE MEAT AND POTATOES: WHAT IS THE LATEST DATE THAT WE CAN GUARANTEE THE SQUEEZE WILL HAPPEN BY?</p>
<p>DTC-2021-003- Became effective March 16, 2021 (they know just how f*cked the situation is right now)</p>
<p>DTC-2021-004- Became Effective March 29. 2021 (They can limit damage right now, but have not had to, see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/c-digs/">u/c-digs</a> "why are we trading sideways?" DD)</p>
<p>DTC-2021-002- was submitted to federal register on March 10, 2021. Will become effective 45 days after submission to register if no comments or changes are made, and up to 90 days if revisions are required. DTC-2021-002 became effective 4/16/2021</p>
<p>NSCC-2021-002 (advance filing notice of which was NSCC-2021-801)- was submitted to federal register on March 18, 2021. There is a 45 day review period followed by another potential 45 day review period if comments made require further discussion. Latest possible effective date: June 14, 2021</p>
<p>Edit #2: nscc-2021-801 was passed through the sec with no objections as of may 4th.</p>
<p>Edit #4: Bad news fellow apes and apettes. NSCC-2021-002, which I thought was assured by acceptance of NSCC-2021-801, has been delayed. As of today, May 7, the SEC posted that it is electing to extend the review period to June 21, 2021. This will allow for more deliberation and more comments to be submitted and considered.</p>
<p>OCC-2021-003- Originally, this was posted on February 24, 2021. On April 6th, the SEC posted a notice that this ruling would need further revision and the latest possible filing date would be May 31, 2021. That doesn't mean it will necessarily be passed. it could be passed, rejected, or require further revision. We won't know until May 31st.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #lostcount: OCC-2021-003 was passed today! We now have NSCC-2021-801 and DTC-2021-005 to wait for. This is good news, but the other two are what we really need. This one just adds some liquidity to the OCC to pay us back when a member defaults. It is important, but not nearly as critical as the other two.</strong></p>
<p>DTC-2021-005- This one has been contentious. Currently, we are waiting on the revised version which is being edited for "formatting issues" to be reposted to the DTC's website. It was originally posted April 1st and had an effectiveness date of 45-90 days after publication to the federal register. I have seen people saying it was posted as effective immediately. That is not true. Look at the link below, and scroll to page 38 (lines 1156-1165). It clearly states an effectiveness date of 45-90 days after submission to FedReg.</p>
<p><a href="https://pastebin.com/adT3ZUZ0">https://pastebin.com/adT3ZUZ0</a></p>
<p>Tin-foil hat time: I firmly believe this was pulled for editing, but not pulled for "formatting issues." I think the DTC realized 45-90 days would be too late to have this in effect. Instead of allowing for a waiting period and potential delays (see NSCC-2021-002 above), they decided they would change it to an "effective immediately" ruling. I firmly believe we won't see ruling again until every other ruling is in place. When we see this ruling, the timer starts for the hedges. Since we are only waiting on OCC-2021-003 and NSCC-2021-002, I believe we will see DTC-2021-005 posted shortly after those two rulings go into place.</p>
<p>So, drumroll please . . . The latest possible date all of these rulings could go into effect and allow for regulators to feel comfortable enough to let us squeeze is, in my estimation, the week of June 14, 2021. This is assuming DTC-2021-005 gets publsihed and approved soon after, and the regulators do their job. The day DTC-2021-005 goes into effect will set a timer on the FTDs, one that the hedges cannot escape. This is the breeze that knocks down the house of cards.</p>
<p>Edit #3: with passage of nscc-2021-801 (and in turn nscc-2021-002), the latest possible date the regulators might feel comfortable enough to let us squeeze is now hopefully may 31st.</p>
<p>Edit #5: NSCC-2021-002 has been delayed until at latest June 21, 2021. The latest possible date I believe that regulators might feel comfortable enough to let us squeeze is not June 21, 2021. Hang in there everybody.</p>
<p>I know we hate dates, I do too. If these dates come and go, don't fret. Just buy and hold. These dates change nothing except you can enjoy knowing the regulators could reign hell down on the hedgies whenever they want to after they pass.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Edit #1: NSCC-2021-005 (increase member patronage to supplemental liquidty fund)</strong></p>
<p><strong>This ruling is very telling. It's sole purpose is to increase the amount of capital in the NSCC's deposit fund. All members, depending on and scaling with size, will have to deposit up to $250,000 into the DF upon the rule's effectiveness date. The DF is essentially the NSCC's first line of defense in the event of a member's default. They use the funding in the DF to pay off the defaulted member's debt. According to the member list published by the NSCC in April, 2021, there are 3,440 members. This goes into effect no later than 20 business days after the SEC accepts the rule. Spoiler alert: the SEC still hasn't posted the rule on their website. Ape Speak: The NSCC thinks it doesn't have enough money in the bank right now to pay off a defaulted member's debts, so they are scrambling to get more money.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The minimum deposit amount hasn't changed, ever. I find it extremely telling and blatantly obvious that this is being done now to prepare for what is ahead. Between the massive shorting of 2020, and the banks that have been in a lot of trouble recently, the NSCC is preparing for the worst.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit #6: Confirmation Bias Confirmed!!!!!! I have never been this excited. It looks like my theory here is coming true. See post below. According to OP, with email chains backing, the DTC will release DTC-2021-005 soon, as it has been reviewed by the DTC. It will be EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON FILING TO FEDERAL REGISTER. I think my tin-foil hat time might come true. post link:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngwhzu/where_is_srdtc2021005_the_update/"><strong>https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngwhzu/where_is_srdtc2021005_the_update/</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>If the Thursday closed door stays on this week, I would expect we see this ruling filed Friday. Just a guess, but it aligns with my theory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer- I can't guarantee the email chain contained in the post is legitimate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>EDIT #7- OCC-2021-004 passed May 19th!! This is the one that adds sharks to feed on the carcass. They are getting ready to auction off when they liquidate someone. This might actually be the real key. Skin in the game being delayed is just going to hurt the OCC. NSC-2021-002 does allow margin calls to be placed, but DTC-2021-005 will force margin calls regardless.</strong></p>
