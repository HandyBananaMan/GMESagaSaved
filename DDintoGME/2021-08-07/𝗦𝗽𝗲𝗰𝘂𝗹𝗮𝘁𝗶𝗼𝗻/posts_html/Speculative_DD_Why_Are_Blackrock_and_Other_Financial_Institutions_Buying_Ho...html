<p>TL:DR; Blackrock and crew are buying houses for government kick backs and Rental-Backed Securities </p>
<p>I have a working theory on this but it is still a work in progress. Fortunately for me Stuart Kasdin wrote a fantastic article. Unfortunately it's all really important and even with me cutting out some things, the important pieces are still long. </p>
<p>So there's a <a href="https://www.independent.com/2021/08/01/bidens-infrastructure-bill-includes-affordable-housing/">5 billion dollar for affordable housing</a> in the infrastructure bill. </p>
<p>Current state housing law requires that cities preemptively re-zone locations to accommodate potential new developments. Consequently, landowners may be motivated to build new residential housing units because their properties are now able to generate more income than under the prior zoning. When they can build multifamily housing on a lot, rather than just a single-family home, or shift from growing crops to producing condos, the landowner can make more money from the development. Often, the response of an affected neighborhoods is to then rally in opposition. Sometimes the new housing would then get built, and sometimes it does not.</p>
<p>However, what if the cities did not take the first step of rezoning, but instead, asked landowners/developers where the best areas would be to rezone for potential new residential development projects? Developers, more than city staff, can better identify ideal sites and conditions for future housing development. Thus, cities would ask the landowners/developers to propose potential sites for rezonings, whether changing the permitted use of the land, such as from a commercial use to residential, or increasing the housing density levels in existing residential neighborhoods.
Why is this better? Because the basis for the city‚Äôs approval process would be tied to the reaction from the neighborhood. A city would judge which submissions to accept based on its neighborhood impacts, including evaluating which proposed developments had the greatest public support from the neighborhood and community groups. Because the developer proposals include potential rezonings ‚Äî deviations from the General Plan ‚Äî a city is not required to accept any proposal. The goal of this process is to encourage landowner/developers to submit proposals and for cities to select project proposals that produce the greatest benefits for the community, not simply the developer, and to help build public buy-in. Therefore, part of a developers‚Äô goal would be to propose community benefits, such as creating the vibrant public spaces, walkable settings, and other urban amenities that communities increasingly value.</p>
<p>Therefore, developers would have to negotiate and create a buy-in from residents ahead of time, so their proposals are selected by the city. A city can promote negotiations between homeowners, neighborhood groups, and developers through modified¬†community benefit agreements (CBA). The agreements are deals between developers and coalitions of community groups to ensure that affected residents share in the benefits of major developments. CBAs have covered a wide range of different urban infill development projects, including combinations of retail, residential, office, entertainment, professional sports, and hotel uses. Part of the responsibility for the state would be to design a streamlined, simplified Community Benefit Agreement template, which might serve as the vehicle for a negotiated ‚Äúquid pro quo.‚Äù </p>
<p>The Biden administration‚Äôs infrastructure bill can help to facilitate the negotiated process by providing additional funding to selected projects. Communities can even propose the sorts of sweeteners they are seeking in return for not opposing a project, such as funding to acquire parks and open space, help build a recreation/community center, fund museums, libraries, and performing arts, or create community gardens and dog parks. Additionally, state funds might also support new (safer) mass transit overcoming the traffic burdens that would otherwise impact neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The objective of this approach is to promote negotiations among landowners/developers, neighborhood associations, and community interest groups to produce mutually beneficial outcomes, with the result of: </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Creating a culture of engagement in which the developers and cities reach out to the local stakeholders, ahead of time to gain a broad consensus on the direction of future community development. </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Reducing the costs from delay and litigation. A CBA is a legally enforceable contract, signed by the community groups and by a developer, laying out the community benefits that the developer agrees to provide. In exchange for these community benefits, the community groups promise to support the proposed project.</p>
<p>Now imagine you own a majority of the land or the land it's self. Now you have to negotiate for benefits. What if you also owned the construction company? So you "negotiate" for additional benefits; library, park, etc. So keep all the costs in house and reap big profit as you "negotiated" this new affordable housing. The infrastructure bill gives some added funds as a cherry on top of your negotiating and you now continue or have lucrative real estate. But what if it gets better? What if your new "affordable" housing includes rental properties such as condos, apartments, or houses? Wouldn't it be great to provide rental housing for those that just defaulted on their previous mortgage loans or defaulted on renting? I bet you'd get a nice government kick back for being so understanding after covid. Imagine if there was a new investment vehicle created around oh I don't know 2012, that bundled rentals with mortgages? A little riskier but potential AA or BBB. I believe Blackrock is setting up to make tons of money by buying up land and I will get into residential in a moment but they are stting themselves up to be huge winners after infrastructure bill is in place. Why not buy after crash? Risk. Everyone is gonna be buying land and residential homes after a bubble pop. That could interfere with your plans so may as well pay extra and get in early. It also helps to drive the price up making the bubble bigger so other financial institutions over extend themselves with also buying land and houses so their "assets" look more valuable and try to sell mortgages to new homeowners. </p>
<p>Now for the residential housing play. There is a section for affordable housing renovations in the infrastructure bill. You could buy a lot of houses right away for cash and over market. Let's say a 250k house get bought by BR for 325k. Now you add some simple renovations maybe solar panels you get the idea. Then you put it up for rent for 2k. Well the affordable housing could help knock the price down and you get a nice government payment or tax write off for doing so. So the price drops. Best part you own the construction company so the profits it makes from renovations go to you. And you still own the house so the constant revenue stream is yours to keep or sell in a <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/02/blackstone-rental-homes-bundled-derivatives/">rental- backed securities</a>. Now I know your thinking oh silly op this is Blackstone not Blackrock. Yeah Blackstone created these. But that doesn't mean others aren't going to push them as well. In fact other financial institutions have stated they will in the future. That was 9 years ago! </p>
<p>How does this correlate with GME? Well to be honest it doesn't directly but my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/F1F2F3F4F5F6F7F8/comments/ot3seb/mortgage_forbearance_eviction_moratorium/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">previous dd on eviction moratorium and forbearance</a> could help as sort of bridging. With houses crashing and individuals defaulting and being inelligible for standard mortgages or renting. New affordable housing rentals could surface to "save" The day.</p>
<p>Edit: You wanna know the fucked thing? These rental backed securities can't go belly up. Renter defaults? Fine fuck you get out of my house, next person in. People start buying houses instead of renting? Cool I'll just sell the house for a profit. Added benefit constant revenue flow allows you to buy/ build more houses and continue renting out houses. </p>
<p>NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE</p>
<p>Edit: the edits are coming! üîî the edits are coming! üîî So I wanted to add some benefits of buying houses for institutions outside of Blackrock as they are important and the more listed reasons the better we can all brainstorm and connect the dots. </p>
<p>1: inflating asset valuation for collateral. Any short hedgefunds, banks, financial institutions, etc. can drive the price up by buying in cash over value to make their assets look better. It's like "hey I bought this house for 320k but in this market it's worth 400k let me borrow 600k against it." The house was originally worth 250k.</p>
<p>2: hedging against inflation. If inflation is here to stay at least for a while (suck my transitory ass JPow), then hedging into physical assets will be worth it. The price of the house may drop at first but it will sort its self out if you sell that house you bought at 320k for 400k due to inflation. Once inflation calms down you've made nice profit as the dollar comes back (assuming it does). </p>
<p>3: Buying the dip. If the plan is to turn homeowners into home renters then owning as many homes as possible in advance makes the most sense. The price doesn't matter if the ends make up the current losses. This could be seen as buying the dip now for better profits 2-10 years from now.</p>
<p>4: Bankrupt individual landlords. Eviction Moratorium has been hell for individual landlords that have invested in several houses for rental income. Bankrupting these people and then buying their houses for lesser is one of the worst things to come out of covid. This has also happened with commercial real estate.</p>
