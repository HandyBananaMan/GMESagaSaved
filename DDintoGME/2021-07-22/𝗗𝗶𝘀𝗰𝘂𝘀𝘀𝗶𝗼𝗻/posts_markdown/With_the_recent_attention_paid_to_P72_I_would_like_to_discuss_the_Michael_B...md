I would like to point out these tweets by Burry proceeding the thermostat tweet

Tweet 1: Riddle about part of Crypt0 BEE TEE CEE and a head and shoulder ad [tweet 1](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1406614384714125315/photo/1)

Suggesting the beginning of a [head and shoulders pattern](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp)

Tweet 2: [Talking about bailout and how he doesn't support them](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1406774811049791490)

He will get back to that topic shortly

Tweet 3: Posts a story about [Kenny intentionally damaging a boat so as to get rescued](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1406990492961759233)(bailed out)

Tweet 4: Only 43 minutes later Posts about how there is no such thing as [untraceable bitc0in](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1407001350844698626)

Tweet 5: Posts about [inflation](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1407001692739190787)

Tweet 6: [The Point 72 thermostat post](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1407005118734667777)

Tweet 7: Post about a [literal bull trap](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1407851014166822915)

In investment lingo [A bull trap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bulltrap.asp)

Tweet 8: Proving he was [correct about the bull trap](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1407864449034330118)

My theory is he saw a bull trap in the Bee Tee Cee coin. Attributes it to KG intentionally going overboard with the shorting because he knows it is "too big to fail". Signals that Point 72 is somehow related. And that the huge drop in the Bee Tee Cee price is related to a rug pull. Possibly orchestrated by Point 72 and KG. I also find it interesting that he point to an article about how BTC is possibly traceable meaning we could theoretically prove that it was them..idk what do you think?
