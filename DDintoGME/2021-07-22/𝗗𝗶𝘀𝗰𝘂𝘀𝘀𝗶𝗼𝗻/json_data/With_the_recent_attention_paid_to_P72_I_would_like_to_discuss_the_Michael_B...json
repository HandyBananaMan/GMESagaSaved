Attributes it to KG intentionally going overboard with the shorting because he knows it is \"too big to fail\". Signals that Point 72 is somehow related. And that the huge drop in the Bee Tee Cee price is related to a rug pull. Possibly orchestrated by Point 72 and KG. I also find it interesting that he point to an article about how BTC is possibly traceable meaning we could theoretically prove that it was them..idk what do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Added links. Thanks for the input everyone. ",
