    "selftext": "Hey all, I did some digging into Point72 today. I've been meaning to take a peek, since whenever Point72 is remotely discussed, strange things start happening (major forum sliding on Superstonk. Remember the lego thing?)\n\nThat said, I found this gem in the SEC archive. It's a Form D filing (a sale of stock without the hassle of an IPO), dated January 29th, 2021 (great timing Steve). \n\n[Jan. 29, 2021 Form D Filing, Point72 Capital](https://preview.redd.it/zem4reiwu7g71.png?width=1339&format=png&auto=webp&s=30011dbf71b21bdaee940e4816842a47ccde800b)\n\nNow that begs the question - who's the one buying stock? And for how much? Look no further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[We have a buyer - hello Shorebridge](https://preview.redd.it/7nv90ywov7g71.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee040004cbc2fab219c9cf0d4fb351281533dc37)\n\nHow much you ask?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5.3 billion in this one filing alone](https://preview.redd.it/bex3lszew7g71.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=87912d597a726d9809df33f717f415b19da5c54f)\n\nOkay, so we have a buyer, and we have an amount. Now, I've searched all 3 of the major subs for Shorebridge, and I haven't seen it mentioned. I took this opportunity to dig a little bit. Oh look - \n\n[The Homeland of White Collar Crime \u00ae ](https://preview.redd.it/zrsapk5yw7g71.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=25f438ee4923bf0af219299a80309a46fad73da3)\n\nSo.... what does this mean? I'm not entirely sure. Kinda hoping you guys can provide insight as you always do. Biggest takeaways for me - the \\*timing\\* (January 29th), the \\*amount\\* (5.3 billion ain't no chump change), and the \\*location\\* (Cayman Islands?? Could you be any less discrete). My novice opinion is that this may be a shell company, but I encourage people to poke holes in this.\n\nTL;DR- Point72 sold 5.3 billion worth of stock to Shorebridge Capital Advisors, LLC on January 29th, who are incorporated in the Cayman Islands.",
