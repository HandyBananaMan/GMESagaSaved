<p>Hey all, I did some digging into Point72 today. I've been meaning to take a peek, since whenever Point72 is remotely discussed, strange things start happening (major forum sliding on Superstonk. Remember the lego thing?)</p>
<p>That said, I found this gem in the SEC archive. It's a Form D filing (a sale of stock without the hassle of an IPO), dated January 29th, 2021 (great timing Steve). </p>

<p>Now that begs the question - who's the one buying stock? And for how much? Look no further.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="We have a buyer - hello Shorebridge" src="https://preview.redd.it/7nv90ywov7g71.png?width=1329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee040004cbc2fab219c9cf0d4fb351281533dc37" /></p>
<p>How much you ask?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="5.3 billion in this one filing alone" src="https://preview.redd.it/bex3lszew7g71.png?width=1355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87912d597a726d9809df33f717f415b19da5c54f" /></p>
<p>Okay, so we have a buyer, and we have an amount. Now, I've searched all 3 of the major subs for Shorebridge, and I haven't seen it mentioned. I took this opportunity to dig a little bit. Oh look - </p>

<p>So.... what does this mean? I'm not entirely sure. Kinda hoping you guys can provide insight as you always do. Biggest takeaways for me - the *timing* (January 29th), the *amount* (5.3 billion ain't no chump change), and the *location* (Cayman Islands?? Could you be any less discrete). My novice opinion is that this may be a shell company, but I encourage people to poke holes in this.</p>
<p>TL;DR- Point72 sold 5.3 billion worth of stock to Shorebridge Capital Advisors, LLC on January 29th, who are incorporated in the Cayman Islands.</p>
