In the last couple days the mod drama and subsequent DD into past and current behaviour has caused a lot of individuals to lose trust in the r/Superstonk mod team. As a result, the apes have started to disperse to other GME subs. **I think this is a very healthy development.** While Superstonk has been a great source of information and entertainment, it is also a vulnerability. We all know that there is a targeted effort to infiltrate and confuse / discredit. With the amount of money likely being spent to do so, it is probably just a matter of time until a sub is compromised.

Instead of having a single trusted community, several are now emerging or being returned to. Better yet, each will have their own sets of mods with their own approaches and rules for maintaining integrity. While the defences of one or two may be breached, there is no way all of them will be. No more single point of failure.

I encourage everyone to join other GME subs, but I also encourage you to stay in Superstonk as that sub does have some innovative and rigorous defences (e.g. Satori). So far the list of good GME subs that I'm aware of is as follows:
