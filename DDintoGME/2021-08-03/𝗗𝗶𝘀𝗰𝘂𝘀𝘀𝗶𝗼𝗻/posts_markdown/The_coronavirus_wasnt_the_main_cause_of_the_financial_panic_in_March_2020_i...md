# Title: "The coronavirus wasn't the main cause of the financial panic in March 2020, it was how overleverage some shadow banks are before an exogenous shock happened in the economy and they hadn't cleaned up their act yet when it happens." -PBS Documentary about the Fed is a great watch.

So a few days ago, I read on Reddit about a junk bond ETF and how a large amount of put contracts were opened against it for the next few months. Then it dawned on me that this documentary from PBS explained it perfectly. Ever since of last year, the Fed is experimenting on a new branch of Quantitative Easing (QE3.0) and started not only buying up Mortgage Backed Securities but also corporate bonds, even the B rated or "junk" kinds to calm the shadow bank panic. Now with signs of inflation spiking, these puts contracts were a hedge against the Fed tapering these measures. With this, it means that the demand level for these financial securities will drop, and so does its price.
