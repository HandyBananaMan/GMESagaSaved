(not enough karma to post in other subs)

I know it's been mostly covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nf22qz/theory_on_the_ftd_loop_missing_link_a_t35_surge/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfad03/theory_because_of_the_t21t35_cycle_dd_post_linked/) and many other posts & comments but it wasn't until I charted it that I was blown away by how close the correlation is.

I'm a smooth brain and hardly understand options, but it looks to me like the Jan 15 dates (Feb 24, Mar 25, Apr 26, May 25) are a burden on the hedge funds, and they have to pull money out of crypto prior to meet some kind of capital requirements on those days. Conversely, the Feb 5 dates (Mar 15, Apr 14, May 13) are the opposite, on those days they're able to put the largest amount of their reserves into crypto.

Overall it's trending down though, which means despite them riding the pump'n'dump waves, they're still needing to pull more and more out.

Huge credit to everyone who figured it out before me... I just really like this chart and wanted to share it!

Edit: Ignore the label on the chart that says "(35 US trading days)" T+35 should be Calendar days. Dates are still correct. TY u/iLikeMangosteens
