    "selftext": "I simply put in the last 3 weeks and fit the best curve. There's a 3rd order polynomial function that maps with 0.89 R-squared, looks almost exponential but not quite. It predicts that the Fed will hit $500B by Friday, and if they were not limited to that, $1T by June 6.\n\n[Up and to the right! That's good, right?!?](https://preview.redd.it/iv37n1nc05171.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=b19c9dc0e7bdd1a5fea2c251cd5d2f9df8ba5dc7)\n\nAccording to the Fed's own explanation ([https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details)) they are limited to $500B maximum (and no more than $80B from one participant). Not sure what happens when that limit is reached, but it probably involves bankers freaking out and financial systems going Boink and seizing up. Reduction in leverage, margin calls, maybe forces some short sellers to cover...\n\n[Not a bad metaphor for Treasury rehypothecation](https://preview.redd.it/h3t37x4h15171.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f12120aa6ea11a92a234639d3e2d5559e42173)\n\nEdit:\n\nAnother ape posted some useful commentary on what it might mean when it hits $500B: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkgqje/heres\\_what\\_will\\_happen\\_after\\_the\\_reverse\\_repo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkgqje/heres_what_will_happen_after_the_reverse_repo/)\n\nEdit2:\n\nu/BlindAsBalls did some DD on the true limit of reverse repo and it may be as high as $4.5T but is still $80B per participant: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response\\_to\\_the\\_post\\_about\\_the\\_reverse\\_repo\\_limit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response_to_the_post_about_the_reverse_repo_limit/)",
