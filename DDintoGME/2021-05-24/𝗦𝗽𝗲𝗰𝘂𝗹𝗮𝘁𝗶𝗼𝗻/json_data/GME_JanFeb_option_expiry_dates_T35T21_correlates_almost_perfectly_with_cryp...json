Conversely, the Feb 5 dates (Mar 15, Apr 14, May 13) are the opposite, on those days they're able to put the largest amount of their reserves into crypto.\n\nOverall it's trending down though, which means despite them riding the pump'n'dump waves, they're still needing to pull more and more out.\n\nHuge credit to everyone who figured it out before me... I just really like this chart and wanted to share it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/i.imgur.com\\/R2KTYmW.jpg](https://preview.redd.it/y045iz58o1171.jpg?width=2383&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9266f2a0819d61a9e65c1c24381f998b57ae4628)\n\nEdit: Ignore the label on the chart that says \"(35 US trading days)\" T+35 should be Calendar days. Dates are still correct. TY u/iLikeMangosteens",
