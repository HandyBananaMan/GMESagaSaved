<p>(not enough karma to post in other subs)</p>
<p>I know it's been mostly covered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nf22qz/theory_on_the_ftd_loop_missing_link_a_t35_surge/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfad03/theory_because_of_the_t21t35_cycle_dd_post_linked/">here</a> and many other posts &amp; comments but it wasn't until I charted it that I was blown away by how close the correlation is.</p>
<p>I'm a smooth brain and hardly understand options, but it looks to me like the Jan 15 dates (Feb 24, Mar 25, Apr 26, May 25) are a burden on the hedge funds, and they have to pull money out of crypto prior to meet some kind of capital requirements on those days. Conversely, the Feb 5 dates (Mar 15, Apr 14, May 13) are the opposite, on those days they're able to put the largest amount of their reserves into crypto.</p>
<p>Overall it's trending down though, which means despite them riding the pump'n'dump waves, they're still needing to pull more and more out.</p>
<p>Huge credit to everyone who figured it out before me... I just really like this chart and wanted to share it!</p>

<p>Edit: Ignore the label on the chart that says "(35 US trading days)" T+35 should be Calendar days. Dates are still correct. TY u/iLikeMangosteens</p>
