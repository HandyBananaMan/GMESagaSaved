    "selftext": "Citadels Lifeline - Pump N Dumps?! \n\nDoes anyone else look at the daily movers on RH? Everyday there is some obscure stock that goes up ~150% before crashing down. These stocks usually have low volume except for these movements. \n\nFor example SGOCO is up 115% today, and 700% on the week. Volume 27M, average 13M \n\nEvery time I google these companies it seems like they have some kinda connection to Citadel  - this article was from June 2021 and it looks like smooth Kenny G caught a nice gain on this penny stock\u2026.\n\n\u201cCitadel Investment Group was also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Renaissance Technologies allocated the biggest weight to SGOCO Group Ltd (NASDAQ:SGOC), around 0.0002% of its 13F portfolio.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/is-sgoco-group-ltd-sgoc-a-good-stock-to-buy-950564/\n\nDisclaimer - before I get hammered, I only use RH to look at stocks, transferred forever ago to Fidelity",
