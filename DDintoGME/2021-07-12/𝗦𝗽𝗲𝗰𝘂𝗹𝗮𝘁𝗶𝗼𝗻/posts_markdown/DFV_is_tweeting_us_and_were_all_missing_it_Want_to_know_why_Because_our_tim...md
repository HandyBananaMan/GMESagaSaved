Some of you might remember me from my DD posted over the weekend, [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/ohm7uq/t21\_the\_game\_of\_hide\_seek\_is\_finally\_over\_and/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/ohm7uq/t21_the_game_of_hide_seek_is_finally_over_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Today, I have something else that's going to make you smile and hopefully very happy. But first, a request. Cover them titties before reading any further or shit is about to get reallllly awkward in here reallllly fast. Ugh, I know some of you didn't but whatever, time is ticking, let's begin.

After releasing my DD, I started looking for more connections. Then last night it dawned on me. If our dates are all connected then everything is connected. That includes social media. 

I started looking back at DFV's old tweets and immediately went to check 2 dates specifically. April 14th and April 16th. April 16th was a quarterly options expiry just like January 15th was. Just like July 16th will be. And as for my prediction for July 14th being the new January 13th, well let's say I just got the biggest confirmation bias possible based off of going over the April 14th tweets again. Yes, those should be read as being posted this Wednesday.

Sorry, I had to adjust my pants.

The 14th and 16th correlate exactly with what is expected to come this Wednesday and Friday. Gather around friends and take a look into the future of the next 5 days and get ready for your mind to be blown.

So, I can either post a shitload of pictures every day or you can kindly direct yourself over to theroaringkitty's twitter and take a peek for yourself. The tweets that apply to today are of course April 12th.

I don't know about you all but I would love to see the old tweet threads from DFV that are on SS be pinned 1 by 1 from exactly 3 months after he posted them on Twitter, replacing each every time there's a new tweet. I'd also like Satori to hurry the hell up and approve me but I'm pretty sure Ken's paid shills hopped the line in front of me so I'll continue to be patient.

Keep in mind, the 14th is not the moon, that's our spike. Watch the volume. Watch the price. Want to know when we moon? Watch the chart. Today, we are January 11th. Will the pattern change? Maybe. Time will tell.

Seriously, pack your shit. You hear me? We're headed for the outer atmosphere in 2 days and there's a chance we'll be chilling there for up to a week and one day before liftoff. We're going to be in deep space in less than 2 weeks from now.

Tick. Fucking. Tock.

DFV, I've got a question for you. How freaking amazing were those 2 share offerings? Sorry they messed up your tweets. Got you back on track, buddy.

TLDR: DFV's tweets from April represent what's going on today, to the day. April 12th tweets are today's tweets, April 14th is Wednesday, April 16th is Friday. DFV wasn't wrong. He was early. And because of that, you have yourself a crystal ball for the next 5 days.
