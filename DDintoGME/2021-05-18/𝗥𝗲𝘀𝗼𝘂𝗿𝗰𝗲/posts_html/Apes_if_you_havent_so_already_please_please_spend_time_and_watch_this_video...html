<p>I highly recommend people watch this AMA. I’m glad it exists now because if any shill or paper handed bitch comes at me in the future from now on and whines....”oh but the SI is sooo low, data shows that FTDs are sooo low or you cucks are in an echo chamber or you apes are just a cult”......I’ll just send them the link to this video and tell them to realize the game we are playing.</p>
