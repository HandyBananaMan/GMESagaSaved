<p><strong>Didn't really get any looking in to on /r/Superstonk - wondering if you guys had any ideas</strong></p>
<p>Before we get going, please read this post which is where I first saw this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndz9l8/citadel_advshitadels_negative_boner/</p>
<p>TL;DR ADV is a form not too dissimilar to a 13f - However a big difference is the assets included in calcualting the AUM on an ADV form - see https://preview.redd.it/akglo4g40kz61.png?width=1852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e1a4fefd1c9bf46036ff2d71eb81d7358c541cb
Which means it includes open short positions, debts etc.</p>
<p>Now according to the post above (i've checked a few myself also) an ADV AUM is almost always higher than a 13F value due to things like bonds, real estate etc being included.</p>
<p>Another key takeaway is that it also includes the value of open short positions - Now this ADV was filed on 6th of May and is dated at the 5th of February</p>
<p>GME was $60 on the 5th of february - keep this in mind.</p>
<p>Citadel's latest 13F has a market value of ~$400B and the 13F prior to that was ~380B.</p>
<p>The only reason I can see that the 13F would be larger than the ADV is because either they have a fuck tonne of debt OR they have a fuck tonne of open short positions.</p>
<p>Now - Citadel's ADV AUM is 244.2B as of the effective date of 5th Feb</p>
<p>This means that the potential value of all of Citadel's open short positions could very well be in the neighbourhood of $150B - Now of course we can't assume this is all GME but like I said earlier GME was around $60 at this time - If even 10% of that number is open GME shorts than they had 250M shares shorted at that time.</p>
<p>That's a lot of fucking shares</p>
<p>However, the post that was posted was drowned in the mod drama over the weekend and didn't get much attention - I wanted to pull some attention to this to see if these are numbers that could actually be used.</p>
