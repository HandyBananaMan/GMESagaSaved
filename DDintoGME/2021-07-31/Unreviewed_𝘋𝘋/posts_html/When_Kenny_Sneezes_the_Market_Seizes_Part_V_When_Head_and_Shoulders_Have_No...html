<p>Hello all you beautiful people/apes/apettes!!!  I don't know about YOU all, but my week was ROUGH.  You know how it is when you come back from a TINY break and your boss unloads some bitch-work on you which you KNOW you have to just trudge through...  So there I am, cleaning up my boss' yard (because she's too important to pick up after herself), and I realize that a stray cat has been sneaking in and shitting EVERYWHERE, and holy shit there are fleas, and then the stupid bitch-work that was supposed to take 30 minutes turns into a</p>
<h1>FULL ON FUCKING WEEK-LONG CATASTRO-FUCKFEST BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS IS MY PROBLEM NOW BECAUSE THAT'S HOW BOSSES FUCKING ARE</h1>
<p><img alt="Don't let her looks fool you, she's an absolute slave-driver.  I'm working 100 hour weeks with no overtime pay over here" src="https://preview.redd.it/8mbvct0v7ge71.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97eb9cd7c434998434b1573f2765d981b9fc919" /></p>
<p>Anyway, I FINALLY managed to grab a moment to myself, and figured I'd share my latest crayon drawings with all my friends.  Because we're getting to the point in the story where there are just SO MANY WORDS and seriously NO LIKIE READ, so let's have the prologue in the form of a picture-booküñç</p>
<h1>Once upon a time, there was a glitch.</h1>
<p>Only it wasn't just ONE glitch, they were EVERYWHERE.  <em>wtf???</em>  we all asked in unison.  Slowly we realized that these were NOT glitches, but <strong>ACTUAL TRADES USED BY BIG-MONEY INVESTORS called</strong> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweeptofillorder.asp"><strong>"inter-market sweeps" or "sweep-to-fill orders"</strong></a><strong>!!!</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ok1bta/the_intermarket_sweep_aka_the_straight_upanddown/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">This post covers sweeps in detail</a> for more.  Turns out there were other strange things afoot as well- <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossedmarket.asp">crossed</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockedmarket.asp">locked</a> markets!!  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/onka1q/when_kenny_sneezes_the_market_has_a_seizure_part/">Crossed markets are discussed further in this post</a>, not gonna lie my brain STILL hurts.</p>

<p>But we started to wonder... is it real? Can we trust these things that we see?  Perhaps it was all... <em>just a dream???</em>  Fear not, for we discovered that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omegu8/when_kenny_g_sneezes_the_market_has_a_seizure/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">ALL level 1 data provided as real-time quotes can be trusted as <strong>valid and accurate sources of data</strong> in this post here</a>.</p>

<p>Would nicer data be nice?  Surely.  But what we have <strong>is accurate</strong>.  Finally we realized that these market sweeps, aka "glitches," were trades used SO INCREDIBLY COMMONLY that hardly a trading second passes without someone sweeping something somewhere.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/opb59e/when_kenny_sneezes_the_market_seizes_part_iv_lock/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Sweeps and price movement action is discussed in this post</a>, and finally us poors can finally start to understand WHAT in the hell is happening when GME's price nose-dives for no apparent reason...</p>
<h1>It's because of all these things that we retail traders don't get to see, and for the most part, don't even know exist.</h1>

<p>If you're like me and you're wondering <strong>WHY</strong> any <em>reasonable</em> hedgie would over-pay by $10 just to buy some stock 0.05 seconds faster, let's look to options traders for some answers!  Here's an article on <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-sweep-160559278.html">Yahoo Finance called "What Is an Options Sweep?</a>" which is mostly fluff but does say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sweep orders indicate that the buyer wants to take a position in a hurry, which could imply that he or she is anticipating a large move in the underlying stock‚Äôs share price in the very near future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-financial-advisors-can-use-options-sweeps-2018-01-24">Nasdaq.com article about how a financial advisor might use sweeps</a> to make quick profits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traders and stock scalpers buy very quickly and often sell for profits within seconds. They benefit because others respond at a slower rate allowing the traders to sell to the late-comers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And HERE is some spiffy software I'm going to pay for <em>some day</em> called <a href="https://flowalgo.com/"><strong>FlowAlgo</strong></a> that advertises sweep detection:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/plwans8lphe71.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7fe3c3392e9dcf18acce5c408030658b90146a</p>
<p><a href="https://flowalgo.com/?wvideo=ublt3iwqml"><strong>FlowAlgo's video of price movement after detected events</strong></a><strong>-</strong> gets VERY spicy about midway through.  CLEARLY sweeps are a huge part of daily trading... if you can afford the $$$ to see them.  Regardless, they seem to cause large price movements wherever they go.  Which finally brings us to today!  To understand the next crayon drawings, let's talk about something new....</p>
<h1>the Head and Shoulders pattern!!!  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h1>
<p>So, in a series of tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/BurryDeleted/status/1406698535697911814">Burry on June 20 '21</a>, and then <a href="https://twitter.com/BurryDeleted/status/1408179586106601478">Burry on June 24 '21</a>, Dr. Burry tweeted something about football, hair, shampoo, and bitcoin:</p>
<p><img alt="He might as well have asked me \&quot;what have i got in my pocket?\&quot;" src="https://preview.redd.it/j8d2nwtlgge71.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da35e47b4d75c438757fa322566deccb5254b93b" /></p>
<p>And I swear to god I am <strong><em>literally</em></strong> that dense.  However, at SOME point, I learned that what dr. Burry was talking about was actually a chart formation called the "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp"><strong>head and shoulders</strong></a>" (also, meet the weird-yet-uncomfortably-attractive cousin, the "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverseheadandshoulders.asp"><strong>inverted head and shoulders</strong></a>").</p>
<p>Turns out this little bugger is a pretty powerful pattern!  <a href="https://samuraitradingacademy.com/7-best-price-action-patterns/"><strong>Samurai Trading Academy's "7 Best Price Action Patterns"</strong></a> <strong>ranks our little head-and-shoulders as the</strong> <strong><em>most</em></strong> <strong>predictable trading pattern in existence:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="emphasis mine üñç" src="https://preview.redd.it/t2imazydcge71.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a45502438d83561140a8af2c941c2bd3562d41e" /></p>
<p>So if you see a mysterious figure start to form as you're watching some stock's price movement, it's <strong>NOT</strong> the slender man finally coming for you, it just means the stock has a high chance or reversing whatever price trend it was on.  OBVIOUSLY we are going to see how this has played out in GME's history.  Let's look at what happened 3 days ago on 7/28...</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/rxgxlf82bge71.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d160766a4ad43b04d1b5058ebecf1ed0c86edd9</p>
<p>Um.  What the hell?  Indeed! Here's what us retail traders got to see:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/gg0xi8ng9ke71.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad8d5e873ee4f4c47f4180f47bf18f1a14c46650</p>
<p>So somehow <strong>in the first 30 minutes of trading</strong> a chart pattern with an 83% chance of breaking out UPWARD just takes a huge old shit for no apparent reason, and there's not even a large volume associated with the downward break?</p>
<p>yeaaaaaaaaaa.....  time to peek behind-the-scenes at that 30 minutes of stupidity:</p>
<p><img alt="oh look, a shit storm!" src="https://preview.redd.it/6xt0ijw4qie71.png?width=1524&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b8a8e4f03f4900ab460097f38b1549703453a1d" /></p>
<p>Let's ONLY look at large volume trades (100 shares or more) to see how they affected the price movement:</p>
<p><img alt="mmmmm.   yeaaaaaaa." src="https://preview.redd.it/wbiw0i0kqie71.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1736ceeef468b89b732e8b5055cae801b532b011" /></p>
<p>Many of the most severe downward cuts that the price makes have sweep to sell orders on top of them.  So, sweeps seem to be highly correlated to violent price movement.</p>
<p>Where have I seen this before... oh, I know, the birther of my rage, 4/12 anyone?? Here's what us retail plebs got to see:</p>
<p><img alt="you can see the eggplant even though i didn't draw it, admit it" src="https://preview.redd.it/jmxtkc7f2he71.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bb5d431499594987aa6173140403957e4d89ca9" /></p>
<p><strong>And here is what we DIDN't get to see in that first half hour:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="kenny and gabe playing price-blasters" src="https://preview.redd.it/giyclsplwge71.png?width=1773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7855d51b5d8dd23dc7d2effd98ffc7bbe8dfedc1" /></p>
<p>SO.... was there a head and shoulders forming before this shit-tastrophe??  <em>But of course!!</em></p>
<p><img alt="3 successive shits were taken, the 3rd on 4\/12 being the largest and most satisfying" src="https://preview.redd.it/iwxx2uktiie71.png?width=579&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2873d58088c8b8c392bf76b46ce727ef83904897" /></p>
<p>Okay old news though.  Let's see the last time GME pushed into the $300s...</p>
<p><img alt="peek-a-boo" src="https://preview.redd.it/anjj8zx5kie71.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6cc455de415c5b74398635c356dec40de38922b" /></p>
<p>What a happy little bugger!!  But...  wtf...</p>
<h1>Since June 7th, not a single head and shoulders pattern has resulted in an upward break for GME.  Probability be damned.*</h1>
<p>*I have wrinkles suggesting that true head and shoulders may take 45-ish days, so these may not be full head and shoulders but perhaps baby men saucer-types instead.  Will get updated probability for baby-men-saucer-type chart pattern asap!!</p>
<p><img alt="A shit was taken the morning of June 21st" src="https://preview.redd.it/mb5rj0jpmie71.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ccc8480cb9a7c4b4f2ba391092a88396498dff" /></p>
<p><img alt="Two shits were fired on june 23rd and 24th" src="https://preview.redd.it/b6hwqrxanie71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e9f1e9a763704b9ce4470f997b6a30ecbe1aab6" /></p>
<p><img alt="An especially spicy shit on july 6th after a long holiday weekend" src="https://preview.redd.it/y82a62frnie71.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10db666d2a63757bbfe5c797ab4114c7965371d3" /></p>
<p>Will I go through the individual shit-storms that killed each of these patterns??  OF COURSE!!! But I'm at image limit, so expect further detail in APPENDIX A, coming soon!!! But, speaking of probabilities- ~~with the failed head and shoulders we started the post off with, that makes....  4 patterns in a row....~~  (edits!) Crayon man, who shat the bed just a few days ago, took over a month to form and is more representative of a true head and shoulders pattern, and I'll therefore assign it the full 83% lift-off-chance.  The red man of rage that shat everywhere on 4/12 also took over a month to form- also probably legit.  Happy orange bugger, who <em>actually</em> got to lift off in the end of May, took over a month to form as well.  The chances that <em>all</em> of these guys would have gone off, at 83% a pop, is 57.2%.  Chance of <em>two</em> popping, but not one?  11.7%.  The chances that <em>only one</em> would successfully break upward out of the three? <strong>2.4%.</strong></p>
<p>As for the little guys.... To be safe, we'll assign the last 3 baby-head-and-shoulders patterns that formed over the month of June the same chance of upward breakout as a "double bottom," 78% according to <a href="https://samuraitradingacademy.com/7-best-price-action-patterns/">Samurai trader</a>.</p>
<h1>3 successive patterns that have FAILED to break upward after completing.  There is (edit!) 1.06% of that happening due to random chance.  üí©</h1>
<p>To calculate the chances of fuckery, we must define fuckery...</p>
<pre><code>Fuckery = 100% - [random chance of thing happening]
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, mathematically....</p>
<h1>The chance that fuckery has affected price movement since June 10th is equal to.... 98.94%.  It's science.</h1>
<p>To add to that, the shorts are relying HEAVILY on sweeps during the first 30 minutes of the trading day.  What's so special about the first 30 minutes??  Well...  for a NYSE-listed stock.......   <em>everything.</em>  There are some <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/103103.asp">key differences to how the NASDAQ and the NYSE decide how to price their stocks</a>.  Because for the first and last 30 minutes of trading, the NYSE sets its prices using the "auction method," where <strong><em>only people on the actual trading floor get to participate in the auction</em></strong>*.*  Seriously.  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091113/auction-method-how-nyse-stock-prices-are-set.asp">Read more about the auction method on investopedia</a>.  Please, for me, because I literally have no clue how this works, my bullshit circuit breaker just tripped, brain reset imminent in 5...  4...   3.....</p>
<h1>TLDR: while hedgies have been laughing and calling them "glitches," straight lines in charts are actually caused by trades called MARKET SWEEPS. These are VERY commonplace and one of the main tools shorts use in concentrated shit-storms to fuck with GME's blast-off.  hi kenny üíïüòò</h1>
