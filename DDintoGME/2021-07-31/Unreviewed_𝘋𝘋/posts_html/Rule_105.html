<p>TLDR: Rule 105 could mean that share offerings were an attempt to sell shares to likely long hodlers</p>
<p>We'll try to keep the intro brief: I have the smooth brain, but the reddit gave me a couple wrinkles, and if I see anything, I should share back with the wrinkle givers, and maybe even grow more wrinkles</p>
<p>I have GME but it's not my only rabbit-hole. I started @ GME but have been looking at a number of plays from a number of angles. I 50% YOLO'd, call me what you will. I think with new wrinkles I can create some positive flow from 50% not GME, creating proceeds to continue buying pressure on GME.</p>
<p>ANYWAY, deep in the rabbit hole of how Sabby is like, the definition of a short hedge fund that's likely to be in a situation right now and I find this</p>

<p>Wait... what about those GME offerings again??? From what I'm seeing with the searches it looks like offerings on/around 4/5 and 6/9</p>

<p>So, to me, what I think we've gathered here (and I am open to being educated and finding out I'm wrong, again, only have like maybe 1 wrinkle here) but what I interpret this all to mean is that they used stock offerings timed around anticipated short sells to sell to hopefully what would be their long hodlers, I'm starting to buy into the idea that the stock offerings indeed were some kind of 4d chess move and that rule 105 would either get stock to the apes OR EVEN MORE JUICY -- they figured the SHF would just ignore the rule, pay the fine like normal, but RC has the lawyers locked and loaded?? Would a rule 105 violation let GME board take certain actions??? I could be misunderstanding the dates or interpreting any of this wrong, but, it looks to me like an effin genius move</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks so much for the awards and such, I really do appreciate it, glad to contribute in any small way after taking so much knowledge from the group</p>

<p>Addendum 1: Is it possible all these things are related also????</p>

<p>All 3 have had share offerings this year, right?? Jeffries was able to stop borrowing shorts on all 3 right?? Is it possible that they have evidence of 105 violations and are using that as good cause to stop allowing shorts???? I'm probably wrong, but as most things GME, could be part of a market wide picture. </p>
