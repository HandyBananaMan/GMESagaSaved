This is just a theory and speculation as such, feel free to post your opinions as to whether it's right or not. 

So, in their paperwork today, they confirmed the sale of 5 million shares at an unspecified time in the future.

Nobody seems to be talking about this at all, and are more interested in some fucking livestream.

So, I didnt expect another stock sale, especially after the most recent one which cleared debt.

But it kinda makes perfect sense. If you're gonna start offloading shares, then you have to tell the SEC. And that's what they've done, and declared it to be an unspecified time.

This isn't some movie stock dilution as such, or the creation of more shares. Its a straight up sale. 

Let's assume the price runs to $1000/s (put your pitchforks down cultists, this is just an easy math number).

5 million shares sold at this price, equates to...  *Dr Evil Voice*

# 5 Billion Dollars

And lets face it, if we're running at 1000/s the volume is going to be insane. It'll be Jan levels of volume, in the hundred million plus. Who the fuck is gonna notice a 5 million sale block in amongst all that volume. Tbh, it'd probably be even higher, maybe 150 mil volume. Nobody will notice the sale, it might dent the price a tiny bit, but gives GME 5 billion tokens to play with. 

This isn't even unrealistic or game breaking. Microsoft have about 140 bil cash on hand, so 5 bil cash fits in perfectly with GME's size. And imagine what the fuck you can do with no debt and that much money.

Even if they unloaded at $500/s that still gives them over 2 billion in cash. 

It's a master stroke, and they get to dictate when they sell. If their previous form is to be taken into account, they'll sell when we wont even notice, then drop the bomb on us one day that they sold and suddenly have billions in the bank. Then comes the acquisitions and so forth. This drives the fundamental price higher and higher. 

The sale is a big number, but not too big as to show greed, but big enough to generate the cash they want. It's also at a time set by themselves, which keeps any hedgie guessing about when GME might unload, which takes blame away from the board for any price drop. 

Fuck the share vote, this share sale could be the best thing Gamestop has done and seen for decades.

# Edit - So, my theory is fucking **BROKEN**

Since I typed this, the filing has been released which confirms the max price they can sell for is $255.39

Which equates to - 1,276,950,000 Dollars. So 1.2 billion.

Still, its a reasonable warchest to have. There was regular talk about SLGG working with GME. the SLGG market cap is only around 200 mil, so GME can make acquisitions of this nature or similar and still have plenty of cash.

Also, don't forget, they have about 700mil on tap already, so the warchest has about 2 billion dollars inside now.

I'll leave it up for visibility because the thought still remains, just reduce the jacking of tits pls.

**Edit again** - Some people suggesting the $255 is just a speculative price for tax purposes, so i don't know which is right and havent had time to confirm it yet.

Either way, money gonna roll in soon.
