    "selftext": "Latest from the NY Fed Desk, $479.5B in reverse repo treasury lending with 50 counterparties ([link](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp)). Down by only 1%, counterparties unchanged. R^(2) value still at 0.95 on the curve. See below for what this means and how it \\*might\\* relate to GME. \n\nI think, given recent DD (including [today's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmxmri/clearing_up_the_fed_reverse_repos_and_what_it/) from u/c-digs), that this is either a) banks getting handed too much cash and trying to get it off their books overnight by turning from a liability (customer cash) to an asset (Treasury), or b) banks lending these Treasuries to hedge funds to improve their collateral and avoid margin calls. Or maybe a combination of both.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4v9sr4gmaw171.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=d32e1c1d75c0d3285320b36eaadf7ae3b2063f80\n\nLinear match improved, with R^(2)  of 0.927:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axwx1sj1bw171.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=edfca046fe0c418826727e8009f7fdd00f0483f0\n\nQuick reminder: there is no $500B cap on Reverse Repo treasury lending. There is, however, an $80B limit per participant, so individual banks may start 'running out' of Treasuries to lend onward to their hedgie friends, if that is what they are doing.\n\n# Useful links\n\n* Yesterday's chart: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nmcn1e/reverse\\_repo\\_overnight\\_lending\\_chart\\_update\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nmcn1e/reverse_repo_overnight_lending_chart_update_for/)\n* DD into Repo/Reverse Repo for those who are curious: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nlbsgy/the\\_fed\\_repo\\_market\\_and\\_overleveraged\\_equities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nlbsgy/the_fed_repo_market_and_overleveraged_equities/)\n* Some DD on the true limit of the reverse repo by [u/BlindasBalls](https://www.reddit.com/u/BlindasBalls/): [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response\\_to\\_the\\_post\\_about\\_the\\_reverse\\_repo\\_limit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response_to_the_post_about_the_reverse_repo_limit/)\n* Helpful/hilarious explainer on the Reverse Repo situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nixxvc/fed\\_is\\_in\\_a\\_pickle\\_economy\\_is\\_fuk\\_edition/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nixxvc/fed_is_in_a_pickle_economy_is_fuk_edition/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n* Where's the cash coming from?
