Latest from the NY Fed Desk, $479.5B in reverse repo treasury lending with 50 counterparties ([link](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp)). Down by only 1%, counterparties unchanged. R^(2) value still at 0.95 on the curve. See below for what this means and how it \*might\* relate to GME. 

I think, given recent DD (including [today's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmxmri/clearing_up_the_fed_reverse_repos_and_what_it/) from u/c-digs), that this is either a) banks getting handed too much cash and trying to get it off their books overnight by turning from a liability (customer cash) to an asset (Treasury), or b) banks lending these Treasuries to hedge funds to improve their collateral and avoid margin calls. Or maybe a combination of both.

Linear match improved, with R^(2)  of 0.927:

Quick reminder: there is no $500B cap on Reverse Repo treasury lending. There is, however, an $80B limit per participant, so individual banks may start 'running out' of Treasuries to lend onward to their hedgie friends, if that is what they are doing.
