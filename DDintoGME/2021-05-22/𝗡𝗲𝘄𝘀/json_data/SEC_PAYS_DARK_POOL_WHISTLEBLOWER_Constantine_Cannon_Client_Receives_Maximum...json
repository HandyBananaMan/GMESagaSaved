ITG paid [$20.3 million](https://constantinecannon.com/2015/08/21/sec-enforcement-spotlight-itg-pays-over-20-million-to-settle-charges-related-to-its-dark-pool/) in 2015\u00a0to settle these charges. Less than two years later, ITG paid [$24.4 million](https://constantinecannon.com/2017/01/17/january-12-2016/) to settle charges that it violated federal securities laws when it prompted the issuance of American Depository Receipts (ADRs) without processing the underlying foreign shares. In 2018 the SEC brought an enforcement action again ITG yet again, finding this time that ITG sent certain clients daily reports identifying the top 100 stocks for which orders were placed and the top 100 stocks for which orders were executed. \u00a0**These clients included high-frequency trading firms (HFTs), which often engage in the exact predatory trading practices dark pool subscribers seek to avoid.** \u00a0While promising protection from predatory traders, ITG, the SEC concluded, effectively served up open client orders to high-frequency traders. In 2018, ITG and AlterNet paid [$12 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-256)\u00a0to settle these charges.\n\nThe 2015 and 2018 ITG settlements involve the types of misconduct that Michael Lewis warned about in\u00a0*Flash Boys*, his bestselling 2014 expos\u00e9 of high-speed trading.\u00a0 It also adds to the list of major enforcement actions the SEC has brought involving market-structure violations, for which dark pools, exchanges, and broker-dealers have paid more than $100 million in civil penalties.\u00a0 These include enforcement actions against:\n\n* Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, a broker-dealer, [paid](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-108)\u00a0a $42 million penalty for misleading customers by \u201cmasking\u201d the fact their external liquidity providers executed their orders, leading customers to wrongly believe that Merrill Lynch executed them.\n* **Citadel Securities LLC, a broker-dealer affiliate of a high-frequency trading firm, paid $22.6 million to settle** [**charges**](https://constantinecannon.com/2017/02/21/january-13-2017-7/) **that it misled clients by claiming its algorithm sought to obtain the best price in the marketplace when it did not.**\n* The New York Stock Exchange and two affiliated exchanges, which agreed to pay $14 million to settle\u00a0[charges](https://constantinecannon.com/2018/06/01/march-6-2018/)\u00a0that they failed to comply with exchange rules and federal securities laws.\n* Citigroup Global Markets Inc., which paid more than $12 million to settle\u00a0[charges](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-193)\u00a0that its affiliated dark-pool operator misled subscribers with assurances that high-frequency traders were not permitted to trade in the dark pool.\n* **Three broker-dealers\u2014Citadel Securities LLC, Natixis Securities Americas LLC, and MUFG Securities Americas Inc.\u2014which paid more than $6 million to settle**\u00a0[**charges**](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-275)\u00a0**that they provided to the SEC incomplete and inaccurate \u201cblue sheet\u201d trade data that the SEC uses to investigate insider trading and other fraudulent activity.**\n\nAs SEC Market Abuse Unit Chief Joseph Sansone has made clear, the SEC \u201ccontinues to scrutinize dark pools to ensure that they protect client trading information and operate in compliance with the securities laws.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Constantine Cannon\u2019s client, at least two other claimants unsuccessfully sought whistleblower awards in connection with these ITG settlements.\u00a0 **Our client\u2019s award comes on the heels of numerous**\u00a0[**blockbuster successes**](https://constantinecannon.com/2020/10/08/record-shattering-whistleblower-rewards-2020/)\u00a0**for Constantine Cannon clients and a**\u00a0[**record-breaking year**](https://constantinecannon.com/2020/10/09/sec-record-year-of-whistleblower-rewards/)\u00a0**for the**\u00a0[**SEC Whistleblower**](https://constantinecannon.com/practice/whistleblower/whistleblower-types/whistleblower-reward-laws/sec/)\u00a0**Program.** \u00a0The\u00a0program offers awards to whistleblowers who provide high-quality, original information that leads to enforcement actions that recover more than $1,000,000. \u00a0These awards range between\u00a0[10 and 30% of the money collected](https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower). \u00a0All told, the program has paid roughly\u00a0[$901 million to 163 individuals](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-86)\u00a0during its nine-year tenure.\n\nNotably, whistleblowers do not have to be \u201cinsiders\u201d to be eligible for an award. \u00a0And whistleblowers who are represented by counsel can submit information anonymously.\u00a0 For more information on whistleblower reward programs or to speak with a Constantine Cannon whistleblower attorney, please click\u00a0[here](https://constantinecannon.com/practice/whistleblower/contact/).\n\nSource: [https://constantinecannon.com/2021/05/21/client-receives-maximum-award-for-blowing-the-whistle-on-itg/](https://constantinecannon.com/2021/05/21/client-receives-maximum-award-for-blowing-the-whistle-on-itg/)\n\n\\--- end of article---\n\nITG Inc. is owned by Virtu Financial.
