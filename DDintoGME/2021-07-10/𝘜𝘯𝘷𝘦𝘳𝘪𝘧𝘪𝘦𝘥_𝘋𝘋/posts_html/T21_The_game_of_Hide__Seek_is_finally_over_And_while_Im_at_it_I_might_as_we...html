<p><strong>January 13th... What am I talking about?</strong></p>
<p>January 13th is what I refer to as <em>Day 0</em>. This was <em>'the spike'</em> that caused the build-up to our January mini-squeeze. I'll explain everything as we move along chronologically but first, let's establish some patterns.</p>
<p>What happened in the 12 days prior to January 13th? Our volume had lows down to 4.9 million and highs up to 14.9 million. Also, our prices saw lows down to $17.08 and highs up to $21.97.</p>
<p>Then the 13th happened. <strong>Boom</strong>. 144 million volume in a single day. That's more than 1.5 times the volume of the previous 12 days <em>combined</em>. We opened at $20.42, reached a high of $38.65 and ended up closing at $31.40.</p>
<p>Then over the next 5 days we reached lows of $33.05, highs of $45.52 and on the 6th day we appeared to start going parabolic. That 6th day, we reached a high of $76.76, Day 7, a high of $159.18, Day 8... $150, Day 9... $380, Day 10... $483.</p>
<p>Don't worry. I won't go into as much detail going forward. I'm just trying to demonstrate why the above matters, especially the part where we appear to start going parabolic close to Day 6 after every spike.</p>

<p><strong>January 25th</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people lost faith in the 21-day cycle. I never did and I'll do my best to explain why. If you look at the chart, you can see what happened on the 25th of January, 7 days after our spike. I believe this is the day that short sellers trapped themselves into a cycle that would begin the creation of our glorious cup.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>February 24th</strong></p>
<p>Day 21. We hit 67.4 million volume on this day. The price opened at $44.70 and we reached both a high and a close of $91.71. This spike started the run-up to the peak of the left side of our cup. Once again, it appeared we started going parabolic around Day 6 and as of Day 10 we hit our March peak, the left side of our cup... $348.50. We consolidated in the days leading up to the 24th of February and did experience more volume on that day than any of the days leading up to it during our consolidation period but it was not as drastic as what had happened in January.</p>

<p><strong>March 25th</strong></p>
<p>Day 21. We hit 50.4 million volume on this day. The price opened at $123.49, we reached a high of $187.50 and closed at $183.75. We once again start experiencing consolidation from Day 1 to Day 5 and what happens on Day 6 when we normally end up going parabolic? A share offering of 3.5 million at-the-market is announced. Without this, we would have went parabolic and the cup would have been invalidated. <em>Welcome to the chess game.</em></p>

<p><strong>April 26th</strong></p>
<p>Day 21. This is where people lost faith in the 21-day cycle. But they shouldn't have. Why? Remember that share offering announced on April 5th? Well, it was announced as completed at the end of trading on the 26th and I believe it re-established the 21-day cycle. Perfectly played. Yes, we're definitely watching a chess match. <strong>Check.</strong></p>

<p><strong>May 25th</strong></p>
<p>Day 21. 14.4 million volume. We opened at $181, reached a high of $217.11 and settled in with a close of $209.43. On Day 9 we reach the peak of the right side of our cup with a high of $344.66. What happens on Day 10? Welcome to our June 9th at-the-market share offering. This is the beginning of our handle. <strong>Check</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>June 24th</strong></p>
<p>What about June 24th? Well, I've seen a lot of people mention that they don't think the share offerings are impacting the price much at all. No disrespect to anybody but I believe this is entirely wrong. I think it's clear that it did so back in April and also again in June. Not only did GameStop kindly offer a total of 8.5 million more shares At-The-Market which short sellers could have used to cover if they so wished (<em>Spoiler Alert: they didn't</em>), but I believe it also served to do 2 additional things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I believe it was used to guarantee the MOASS by kicking the can down the road so we could align with a date where we are going to have a significant price spike (July 14th) which just so happens to be 35 days from when the June 9th ATM was announced. Feel free take this one with a grain of salt though if you choose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe the short sellers used these 8.5 million shares to short immediately as of the announcements and I don't think they limited themselves to the 8.5 million either when taking liberty to do this. Take this with however much salt you deem appropriate though.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>So, what now?</strong></p>
<p>I know, you know, we all know by now... we already won. At this point in time we're just going through the motions. But this is what I see. The price is going to spike on July 14th. Can it be a different day? Sure, but I really believe it's the 14th. I think we will see an insane amount of volume and a large price increase on that day. Do I think we'll moon on that date? Nope.</p>
<p>At least not based on previous patterns. I don't know options well enough to know what will happen as a result of all the Calls/Puts ITM/OTM on July 16th but I imagine that things are going to get crazy. And fast. But moon, I don't think so. At least not yet anyway.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Now for the party trick.</strong></p>
<p>Remember when GameStop announced the share offering completion on April 26th? This restarted us on a 21-day schedule. Now, did you pay attention to when the June ATM completed? June 22nd. Lets count 21 trading days from the 22nd and see what we uncover shall we?</p>
<p>Wait. First of all, I don't do dates. Ask my fiancee. Last date she went on was April 20th and all she got was an ice cream cone, a proposal and a tweet.</p>
<p>Fine, be that way. I know you can do math anyway so I might as well come out and just say it. 21 trading days from June 22nd lands us on... July 22nd. Day 6. <strong>Checkmate.</strong></p>

<p>My advice. For most of you, I believe this is the last '<em>normal</em>' weekend of your life. What happened over the last 6 months is going to make you a very wealthy individual. Let go of any hatred, focus on how you're going to make your life and the life of those around you better. We have a world to change.</p>
<p>Thank you Keith. Thank you Ryan. Thank you GameStop. Thanks to everybody who has been a part of this journey. And with that said... <strong>Buckle up</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: T+21 exists. I believe it gets reset at the completion of every ATM offering. Our next has been moved up to July 22nd and it lands right as I believe we're going to be sitting on the edge of space as a result of a July 14th spike.</p>
