<p>(I changed the word "shorts" to "options" in the title, as per OP's edit)</p>

<p>Just saw this on twitter and found the source --- huge news!</p>
<p>This probably will lead more banks to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Rein in those shorties !!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Investment Banking Company Jefferies suspends short sells on $GME and another 2 stocks!</strong></p>
<p>Jefferies said to block short sells in GME, and another 2 stocks from being executed.</p>
<p>From a trader:</p>
<p>"In addition to naked options, effective immediately, we will be blocking all short sells from being executed at Jefferies. If you choose to execute away, the trade will be subject to review by Risk/Margin prior to being affirmed."</p>

<p>(<strong>cant post the original news link because the link mentions the movie stock and gets blocked by the bot - you easily find it on google - the news source is</strong> <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/">https://www.streetinsider.com/</a> . Just copy paste the trader quotation to google)</p>
<p>EDIT 3:</p>
<p>2 Apes have accused this post of being FUD because there was no link or formal announcement from the bank. <strong>There are now articles confirming this by</strong> <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, <strong>Benzinga. Seeking Alpha is also quoting it.</strong> According to Bloomberg the Bank has announced this to its clients today.</p>
<p>We cannot expect the Bank to send out a public statement about this, cmon... hush hush please, let's not tell the entire planet that the short squeeze is coming.</p>
<p>Edit 1: I wrote naked shorts on the title but I meant naked options as in the quote.</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>Jefferies is a Bank that allows corporate clients (hedgies and the like) to invest through Jefferies.</p>
<p>According to their website, their clients are <strong>corporate and financial sponsor clients.</strong></p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Jefferies Investment Banking is a global leader, offering deep sector expertise and broad advisory and capital markets capabilities <strong>to corporate and financial sponsor clients</strong>. With approximately 900 investment banking professionals across the Americas, Europe and Asia, we provide global coverage across all products and sectors.</p>
<p>Also as pointed out by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Public-Ad6926/">Public-Ad6926</a>:</p>
<p>it appears Jefferies has been targeted by short-sellers back in 2011. See link here:</p>

<p>Karma is a BITCH.</p>
<p><strong>TA;DR: Jeffries does NOT want to be the one holding a colossal bag of</strong> ðŸ’© <strong>when the short squeeze starts, so it just announced: if you want to SHORT GME - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.</strong></p>
<p>Edit 4: DFV seems to have posted about "<strong>JEFFREY</strong>" 15 minutes ago. Not sure if he read this, but if he does let me just say: you're The Absolute Legend. No hero-worshipping, but fully acknowledging and appreciating the GOAT.</p>
