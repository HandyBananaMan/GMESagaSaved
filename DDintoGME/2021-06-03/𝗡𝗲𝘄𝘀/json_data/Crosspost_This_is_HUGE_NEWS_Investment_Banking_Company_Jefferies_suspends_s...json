If you choose to execute away, the trade will be subject to review by Risk/Margin prior to being affirmed.\"\n\n\"\n\nOriginal tweet: [https://twitter.com/Joshuajammes/status/1400471689549520901](https://twitter.com/Joshuajammes/status/1400471689549520901)\n\n(**cant post the original news link because the link mentions the movie stock and gets blocked by the bot - you easily find it on google - the news source is** [https://www.streetinsider.com/](https://www.streetinsider.com/) . Just copy paste the trader quotation to google)\n\nEDIT 3:\n\n2 Apes have accused this post of being FUD because there was no link or formal announcement from the bank. **There are now articles confirming this by** **Bloomberg**, **Benzinga. Seeking Alpha is also quoting it.** According to Bloomberg the Bank has announced this to its clients today.\n\nWe cannot expect the Bank to send out a public statement about this, cmon... hush hush please, let's not tell the entire planet that the short squeeze is coming.\n\nEdit 1: I wrote naked shorts on the title but I meant naked options as in the quote.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nJefferies is a Bank that allows corporate clients (hedgies and the like) to invest through Jefferies.\n\nAccording to their website, their clients are **corporate and financial sponsor clients.**\n\n\"\n\nJefferies Investment Banking is a global leader, offering deep sector expertise and broad advisory and capital markets capabilities **to corporate and financial sponsor clients**. With approximately 900 investment banking professionals across the Americas, Europe and Asia, we provide global coverage across all products and sectors.\n\nAlso as pointed out by [Public-Ad6926](https://www.reddit.com/user/Public-Ad6926/):\n\nit appears Jefferies has been targeted by short-sellers back in 2011. See link here:\n\n[https://www.gurufocus.com/news/153760/jefferies-ceo-issues-letter-saying-shortsellers-spreading-malicious-lies-about-company](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/153760/jefferies-ceo-issues-letter-saying-shortsellers-spreading-malicious-lies-about-company)\n\nKarma is a BITCH.\n\n**TA;DR: Jeffries does NOT want to be the one holding a colossal bag of** \ud83d\udca9 **when the short squeeze starts, so it just announced: if you want to SHORT GME - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.**\n\nEdit 4: DFV seems to have posted about \"**JEFFREY**\" 15 minutes ago. Not sure if he read this, but if he does let me just say: you're The Absolute Legend. No hero-worshipping, but fully acknowledging and appreciating the GOAT.\n\n[https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400522985375780872](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400522985375780872)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7u8xip8sp3371.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6b67485feb8b880ae300c14360d518633c3c880\n\n\\--- end of crosspost ---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to article verifying: [https://www.streetinsider.com/Momentum+Movers/Jefferies+said+to+block+short+sells+in+GME%2C+AMC+and+MVIS+from+being+executed/18515758.html?classic=1](https://www.streetinsider.com/Momentum+Movers/Jefferies+said+to+block+short+sells+in+GME%2C+AMC+and+MVIS+from+being+executed/18515758.html?classic=1)\n\nDFV also made a tweet with a reference to \"Jefferies\": [https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1400522985375780872?s=21](https://twitter.com/theroaringkitty/status/1400522985375780872?s=21)",
