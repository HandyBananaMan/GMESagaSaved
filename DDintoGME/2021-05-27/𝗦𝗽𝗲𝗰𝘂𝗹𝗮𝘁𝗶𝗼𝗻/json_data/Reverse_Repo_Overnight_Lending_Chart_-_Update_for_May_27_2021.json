    "selftext": "Latest from the NY Fed Desk, $485B in reverse repo treasury lending with 50 counterparties. The update exactly matched the curve from the last few days, with R^(2) increasing to 0.95 from 0.93. Showing $1T by June 10. See below for what this means and how it \\*might\\* relate to GME.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7yrdd6mt5p171.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=e61e95b77a74d17fc138011d611e229e92193a95\n\nLinear for my fellow stats nerds. It seems to be growing above linear and the R value is lower:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltohauch6p171.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b31ca90bd08461f4a03024b7153d8593d00935\n\nQuick reminder: there is no $500B limit on Reverse Repo treasury lending. There is, however, an $80B limit per participant, so individual banks may start 'running out' of Treasuries to lend onward to their hedgie friends.\n\n# Useful links\n\n* DD into Repo/Reverse Repo for those who are curious: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nlbsgy/the\\_fed\\_repo\\_market\\_and\\_overleveraged\\_equities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nlbsgy/the_fed_repo_market_and_overleveraged_equities/)\n* Source of Fed Repo/Reverse Repo data: [https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp)\n* Some great DD on the true limit of the reverse repo by [u/BlindasBalls](https://www.reddit.com/u/BlindasBalls/): [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response\\_to\\_the\\_post\\_about\\_the\\_reverse\\_repo\\_limit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response_to_the_post_about_the_reverse_repo_limit/)\n* Helpful/hilarious explainer on the Reverse Repo situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nixxvc/fed\\_is\\_in\\_a\\_pickle\\_economy\\_is\\_fuk\\_edition/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nixxvc/fed_is_in_a_pickle_economy_is_fuk_edition/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nIf you want to see my charts from the last few days, they're on my post wall: [https://www.reddit.com/user/HODLTheLineMyFriend/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/HODLTheLineMyFriend/posts/)\n\nKeep on HODLin', friends! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\\-----\n\nEdit:\n\nOur friend u/wehadmagnets was kind enough to get the walled FT article for me \"US investors park cash at Fed as market wrestles with negative yields\" from here: [https://www.ft.com/content/cdec7f2e-6129-412c-b118-8906a2a0f92f](https://www.ft.com/content/cdec7f2e-6129-412c-b118-8906a2a0f92f).\n\nTA;DR:\n\n* Today's Reverse Repo was the largest ever\n* \"Investors\" (more than just banks) are seeking places to park cash, as other 'safe' places are drying up and/or having zero or negative rates\n* \u201cIt is also not over yet.\u201d -- analyst at Oxford Economics\n* Cash reserves ballooning due to \"the Fed\u2019s purchases of $120bn of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities each month\"\n* Money-market funds are getting swamped with people's cash (<speculation>flight from equities?</speculation>)\n* Fed is trying to avoid negative rates in money market\n* No one thinks it's over\n* Fed may have to raise interest rates on RRP or reserve balances in member banks to keep the federal funds rates from going lower (at 0.06 on target of 0.0-0.25)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nOne more tweak, u/leisure_rules noted that the $120B is $120b total, $80b in T-Bonds and $40b in MBS (Mortgage Backed Securities).\n\nUm... could those be the Commercial MBS we've been hearing about that are toxic?",
