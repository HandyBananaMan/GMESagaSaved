<p>Latest from the NY Fed Desk, $485B in reverse repo treasury lending with 50 counterparties. The update exactly matched the curve from the last few days, with R^(2) increasing to 0.95 from 0.93. Showing $1T by June 10. See below for what this means and how it *might* relate to GME.</p>

<p>Linear for my fellow stats nerds. It seems to be growing above linear and the R value is lower:</p>

<p>Quick reminder: there is no $500B limit on Reverse Repo treasury lending. There is, however, an $80B limit per participant, so individual banks may start 'running out' of Treasuries to lend onward to their hedgie friends.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Our friend u/wehadmagnets was kind enough to get the walled FT article for me "US investors park cash at Fed as market wrestles with negative yields" from here: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cdec7f2e-6129-412c-b118-8906a2a0f92f">https://www.ft.com/content/cdec7f2e-6129-412c-b118-8906a2a0f92f</a>.</p>
<p>TA;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Today's Reverse Repo was the largest ever</li>
<li>"Investors" (more than just banks) are seeking places to park cash, as other 'safe' places are drying up and/or having zero or negative rates</li>
<li>‚ÄúIt is also not over yet.‚Äù -- analyst at Oxford Economics</li>
<li>Cash reserves ballooning due to "the Fed‚Äôs purchases of $120bn of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities each month"</li>
<li>Money-market funds are getting swamped with people's cash (<speculation>flight from equities?</speculation>)</li>
<li>Fed is trying to avoid negative rates in money market</li>
<li>No one thinks it's over</li>
<li>Fed may have to raise interest rates on RRP or reserve balances in member banks to keep the federal funds rates from going lower (at 0.06 on target of 0.0-0.25)</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>One more tweak, u/leisure_rules noted that the $120B is $120b total, $80b in T-Bonds and $40b in MBS (Mortgage Backed Securities).</p>
<p>Um... could those be the Commercial MBS we've been hearing about that are toxic?</p>
