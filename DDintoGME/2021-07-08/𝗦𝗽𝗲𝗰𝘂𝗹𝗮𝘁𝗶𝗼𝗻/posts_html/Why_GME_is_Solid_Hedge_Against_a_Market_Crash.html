<p>First of all, I am no expert. I have some background in economics and finance, but nothing crazy, I just know the basics. I had a thought while doing some research that might be insightfull to some people. This all pretty basic stuff and nothing new, but I have never thought of it this way.</p>
<h1>Burry about Leverage and Liquidity: What does it mean?</h1>
<p>I was looking at the tweets M. Burry recently send out about 'the Greatest Speculative Bubble of All Time in All Things. By two orders of magnitude' (his exact words). Now I know there is some critique on Burry, but you cannot deny he does his homework. Chances are that he has done more DD into this than any other 'expert' on Wallstreet right now. You don't have to believe anything he says, but at least pay attention. So lets see...</p>
<p>Based on what he says and the recent low interest rates, low yields of low-risk assest (such as t-bonds and blue chip stocks) and figures about liquidity pumped into the market by the Fed, it is safe to assume this 'speculative bubble' Burry is talking about is a result of too much liquidity in the market. This is nothing new. People can get their hands on a lot of cash, dirt cheap. As long as you invest your borrowed cash into an asset that yields more than the interest you pay, you make money. You simply pay back your borrowed money plus interest, and pocket the rest. This is called leverage, which is basically nothing more than investing with borrowed money. The only problem with leverage is that it is considerably more risky, because if your investments drop in value (because of say, a market crash), you still have to pay back your borrowed money. In this way you can essentially lose more money than you own. This is something that cannot happen if you invest just your own cash, because the lowest your investment can go is to 0 (I will come back to this later). </p>
<p><strong>Short recap: because of low interest rates and some other stuff (not relevant for this post) a lot of people borrowed a lot of money and leveraged themselves on positions in the market. This means they exposed themselves to risk upon a market crash, because they could lose more than they have.</strong> </p>
<p>Knowing this, look at this tweet from Burry:</p>
<p><em>'The problem with Crypt0, as in most things, is the leverage. If you don't know how much leverage there is in in crypt0, you don't know anything about crypt0, no matter how much else you think you know'.</em></p>
<p>He basically says that a lot of value of crypt0 is leverage a.k.a. borrowed money. Nobody knows exactely how much, but it makes sense. If there is too much cash in the market, people look for a way to profit from it, and crypt0 is one of these ways. Anyway, enough about this. </p>
<p><strong>The point is that leverage is bad when markets crash, and some parts of the market are over-leveraged, like coins.</strong></p>
<h1>What has GME to do with this?</h1>
<p>Now back to the interesting part. GME is one of the most popular stocks with retail, no doubt. Some assume the GME float to be owned by retail. I have seen the numbers and they make as much sense as any other calculation, but the truth is: we simply don't know. The only thing we know is that GME is popular and a lot of retail owns a lot of GME. </p>
<p>Now get this: if leveraged assets come crashing down the hardest in a market crash, because people need their money back, get margin called and forcably liquidated, the most stable assests would be the ones that are least leveraged right? Like GME, because it is bought en held by retail with mostly cash accounts. Most of us are too dumb to know what a option contract is, let alone how it works. Combine that with the fact that most of retail doesn't give a flying funk about crashes, just a discount right? Anyway.</p>
<p>I think in the event of a market crash, a lot of leveraged posistion will be forcably closed, leaving only the assests hold with 'real' cash, owned by the investor. These investments will not have to be closed so there will be little selling pressure. Even better is the fact that short positions are inherently leveraged and will be forced to close too... The most dangerous markets to be in during a market crash are the over-leveraged ones...</p>
<p>TL:DR: Assuming retail mostly buys with cash instead of leverage, GME might be one of the few assets that is not over-leveraged. This means that in case of a market crash, it might be one of the few 'safe havens' because there will be little forced closures of positions in GME. Instead, the forced closures are short positions, which means GME will moon like no other stock has ever mooned before.</p>

<p>Please feel free to point out any flaws in this logic. As I've said, I am no expert. I also make some assumptions, which is never great for an argument. However, I think these assumptions are as safe as an assumption can be, but destroy them as you see fit. </p>
<p>Also I push crayons into my nose as I mumble about mayonaise and predatory short selling destroying capitalism.</p>
