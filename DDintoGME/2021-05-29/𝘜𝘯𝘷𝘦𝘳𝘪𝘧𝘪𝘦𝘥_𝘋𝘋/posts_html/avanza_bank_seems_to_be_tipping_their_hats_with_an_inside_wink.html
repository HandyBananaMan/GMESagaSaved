<p>i read some of the most useful dd i've seen in some time today, as it pertains to the gme situation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InForTheSqueeze/">u/InForTheSqueeze</a>  posted their mathematical calculations concerning how big the float is.  their calculations indicate that retail owns between 238% and 316%  percent of the float. this calculation is based on the swedish broker's  Avanza banks tweet claiming that they have 22,032 owners who own 322,545  shares of gme. the most important part of this tweet is that this  constitutes <strong>.4%</strong> of the total ownership of the stock. this seems to be based on about 70,000,000 shares more or less.</p>
<p>when  we compare this with the daily bloomberg terminal screenshot drops. we  notice that canada at the 5th position of highest gme ownership by  geographic location holds .5% of the shares. the next  countries and  ownership percentage are as follows:</p>
<p>netherlands at .32%</p>
<p>ireland at .2%</p>
<p>germany at .1%</p>
<p>9th and final country shown is france at .02%</p>
<p>it  appears to me that sweden should occupy the 6th position of countries  with the highest gme ownership. however, they are not even in the top  nine.</p>
<p>from the research i've done  it doesn't seem as if avanza has clients in other countries and if they  are spread out through scandanavia one of those three countries must  have more than .1% ownership and therefore be ahead of germany.</p>
<p>it  seems as if avanza is saying to us, "hey fuckheads! someone is hiding  shares somewhere. we think their are some synthetic shares hangin' out  in our customers accounts. someone should really do something about  this!"</p>
<p>links in comments. if i've missed something let me know. country ownership is on the fourth page of the terminal drop.</p>
<p>disclosing that this was also posted on superstank, but memes and shitposts reign supreme there, so i wanted to target an audience that gets off on data porn. here you go.</p>

<p>edit: this is a comment from u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DBRASCO1891/">DBRASCO1891</a> "Avanza is only for swedes. Avanza buys shares from the US via an  custodian bank.. BNP paribas.. yeah I know.. I have my worries as well.  But thats the reality! So we swedes who buys through this custodian  probably gets counted in the "unknown" on bloomberg terminal."</p>
