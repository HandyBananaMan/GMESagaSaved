<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hello, beautiful ape family.  Today is a GOOD day.  Why's that, you ask?  Well.....   can't you smell it?  That sweet, slightly spicy aroma floating on the air....    a strange mixture of dandelion essence, green fields filled with dreams, and flop-sweat?  I love that smell....  <strong><em>What is it, you ask????</em></strong></p>
<h1>The smell of hedgie fear.</h1>
<p>So this story begins as I was analyzing data from several different "glitches" that occurred last Tuesday (7/13) after-hours.  (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omegu8/when_kenny_g_sneezes_the_market_has_a_seizure/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><strong>The Glitchening</strong></a> follows that adventure.)  I noticed something so strange that I thought surely my code had an error....  or SURELY I copy-pasted some wrong data somewhere....  OR MAYBE EXCEL IS BROKEN!??  SKYNET HAS BEEN ACTIVATED, FUCKING RUN  ....   then I remembered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a>, and realized the most likely answer....</p>
<h1>What if this data is simply....   real?</h1>
<p>What data, you ask?  Let me show you what I stared at for perhaps 30 minutes straight-</p>
<p><img alt="huh what?" src="https://preview.redd.it/i8j5yeoh57c71.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be5bf525de9adbd26f141ec7c20f86550665f29" /></p>
<p>That's DEFINITELY a bid that...  is a <strong><em>higher</em></strong> price than the ask? <em>Huh</em>. So I went on the intarwebs to find out what the hell I was looking at, which led me to the formation of the sweetest, most supple brain wrinkle I've ever formed in my whole fucking life....</p>
<h1>Welcome to Crossed Markets.</h1>
<p>As always I whipped out my crayons and headed to investopedia to see what in the world this strange and new magical thing was.</p>
<p><img alt="yes i fucked this up and had to edit it.  A+ for me" src="https://preview.redd.it/1andtp270ac71.png?width=2052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31cee21c5e45dcecd01b46439a0423907ca91dab" /></p>
<p>And I short circuited.   Acting in panic...??   What's this tingling.... in my tits....    <em>am I getting jacked to the tits???</em>   Let's look into this a bit more-</p>

<p><strong>CONFIRMED - TITS ARE JACKED - TITS ARE JACKED - TITS ARE JACKED -   omg I need JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE....</strong></p>

<p><code>A problem has been detected and ape.exe has been shut down to prevent further damage to your brain. .... Beginning dump of physical memory, ....... physical memory dump complete</code></p>
<p>Phew.... I feel much better now.... where were we?  AHH YES, hedgie panic jacking my tits!!  So as always, I went on to make some pretty pictures so the people with <em>real</em> wrinkels can tell me <em>what in the fuck</em>.  First let's look at an X-ray of the trading that happened for AMC, Tuesday July 13, between 4:35pm and 4:50 pm.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/guif43wk67c71.png?width=1826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a04cae70d219f4e2caa88cc3254fa335d396900e</p>
<p>Sweeps galore, <em>especially</em> that first one with huge volume (which basically started the entire HFT dance party in around 100 stocks, u/djk934 I shamelessly stole your joke).  (If you need help with what you're seeing here, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omegu8/when_kenny_g_sneezes_the_market_has_a_seizure/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">the glitchening</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ok1bta/the_intermarket_sweep_aka_the_straight_upanddown/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">sweeps background</a> will help.)  That first sweep is also where I found the crossed market!!  But telling you that doesn't do any good, apes can't read very well.  So I got my visualizer to do some drawing with crayons for me.....</p>
<p><img alt="now THAT tells a story" src="https://preview.redd.it/qwolyk1o87c71.png?width=1592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5007ebd15a8e2885aa844d7a789a1345d5cb6c1d" /></p>
<p>(Was making this satisfying?  YES.)  So....  I decided to go re-live one of my favorite moments in GME history (or at least the one I've collected data for).  I know that <strong><em>I</em></strong> was making my panic-face, but were the hedgies??</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n0a0hf/proof_of_artificial_price_movement_spreadsheets/">4/12, and I was absolutely pissed that day</a>.  What happened?</p>
<p><img alt="imagine my pissed face" src="https://preview.redd.it/ekedlhxqh7c71.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146310ccf958dbb46274ae477d0703f3a2ab0bb9" /></p>
<p>Okay so...... what REALLY happened during that shitfest from 9:30 to 10:00 am??</p>
<p><img alt="imagine my surprised face" src="https://preview.redd.it/0cpp15nsl7c71.png?width=1618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b795abbfb32f14904d1c9600ef027ba241fab63f" /></p>
<p>WOW.  Full disclosure this was not designed to have the enitre backdrop be sweep indications.  So I adjusted the sensitivity so we only mark "sweeps" when prices land a full 33% outside of the average bid:ask range ($0.13 <em>outside</em> the NBBO in this case):</p>
<p><img alt="imagine my giggles face" src="https://preview.redd.it/t28196dtm7c71.png?width=1501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf3805c6e1037e15f2dba5bc8a19f8da58957252" /></p>
<p>Who else wants to zoom in on 9:43 to 9:50??</p>

<p>That's more like it.  I'll wrap up this post now in the interest of time, but you'd better believe there's more coming- <em>I'm going on a wild glitch hunt, ladies and apes!!!!!</em></p>
<p>I'll report back when I'm back from safari.  You all make sure to ice those poor sore brains.  And as always, take care my friends, keep those diamond hands rock hard and shiny, <strong>and</strong> <strong><em>trust only what you can verify with your own eyes.</em></strong></p>
