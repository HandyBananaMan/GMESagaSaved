UPDATE: First, I want to thank everyone who read this post and contributed their own opinions in a way that added to this conversation. After reading and responding to as many people as possible I have decided to edit this post in a couple of ways.

Second, I want to make it clear that this post is in no way a 'call to action'. I am not suggesting buying ANY stock at ANY time for ANY price. This post is intended to shed some light on how transactions affect the price momentum and allow you to decide what you want to do when and if you want to buy shares.

Third, after reading some very compelling arguments against market buying, I will amend my recommendation of only market buying. Limit buying has its place in the market as a whole and if you were to ask me about ANY other stock, the strategy would be completely different. I have laid this post out with a big assumption attached to it. The assumption being that this stock IS manipulated and its price action does not reflect demand. My advice to use market orders pertains to this stock only and for very specific reasons. That being said, I will go into detail below about what kind of Limit orders are OK and which ones are absolutely a bad idea.

I am convinced this information is so powerful that the shills will stop at nothing to keep it from becoming common knowledge. I have tried to share this before and seen others try to share this basic concept. It is always met with downvotes and aggressive disagreement but without any information to back up their objections. I will continue to share this with as many people and subs to hopefully get it out into the open. Please read this with an open mind. If you are confused about anything, before downvoting and FUD labeling, please ask in the comments. If you have information to prove this incorrect, please show it in the comments.

There is a technique market makers can use to lower the price of a stock legitimately and I believe they have been doing this right under our noses for months. It all stems from a lack of market buy orders. We all know that GME has had an exceptionally low volume at times. Market Makers are able to use this low volume and an order book filled with limit buy orders to drop the price.

We need to stop playing into their hand. Understanding the basic mechanics of the order book is how to do this.

I don't know a lot about Level 2 order book and how to interpret it but there are a few rules that it follows that everyone should know.

Here is an example of the Level 2 order book for GME from WeBull.

There is a BID side (The Buy Side) and an ASK side (The Sell Side).

When a person wants to Sell some GME stock they can sell with a market order or limit order. Selling at the market (NBBO) does not show up on the order book. When you sell with a LIMIT order it shows up in this order book on the ASK side. No matter what price you want to sell your shares for, if that price is above the market price, it shows up in this order book and as you can see in this screenshot someone has put in a sell order at 10,000 and it shows up in the book. All the LIMIT sell orders are listed in descending order. This means that the lower price limit sells get priority over the higher price sells.

Limit sell orders that are below market price do not show up in the book because a standard sell limit order is treated as a market order until the market price falls below its limit.

The reverse is true for BUY orders. When a person wants to BUY GME shares with a LIMIT order, they show up on the BID side in ASCENDING order. Market BUY orders do not show up in the book.

Why is this important to understand? You are not allowed to pay more than the NBBO for a share of stock. So if GME is at $164 but I want to buy it for say $179 (you can see there is a Limit Sell order at that price on the book by the green arrow) you will NOT be able to buy it at that price. Why? Depending on the style of limit order you implement either your buy order will be filled at the market or your order will wait (off the order book) until the NBBO rises to 179 to fill your limit order.

Now, what happens if you buy with a LIMIT order for LESS than the current market price (NBBO). To start, your limit buy order shows up in the book and takes a place in line with all the other limit buys. More importantly, it waits until the price DROPS to fill you. You are essentially telling the world that this stock is not worth buying until it's cheaper. You wait for downward momentum to carry the price to your order to fill it. So then your order is filled on downward momentum and then you expect it to suddenly go up?

What makes a stock's price move up or down? If you say "Supply and Demand" You are mostly right but there is still a human being acting as the grease of this process and that person is The MARKET MAKER (MM). A MM is a person who sits behind this order book and connects buy and sell orders together. So since all the BID buy orders are below the market price and all the ASK sell orders are above the market price it is at the Market Makers discretion to CHANGE THE MARKET PRICE OF THE STOCK TO ENCOURAGE BUYING AND SELLING. When would the market maker change the stock price? - When there are not enough market buy or market sell orders coming in to meet the order book demand (low volume). If there are not enough Market orders coming in but all these limit orders are sitting there, the market maker will either fill the next limit sell order on the books causing the price to rise or he will fill the next limit buy order causing the price to fall. He gets to choose which one to fill! So if you have a Market Maker motivated to lower a stock's price, which orders do you think he will fill? LIMIT BUY ORDERS.

THEORETICALLY, IF THERE ARE ZERO LIMIT BUY ORDERS\* ON THE BOOKS THE ONLY DIRECTION A MARKET MAKER COULD ADJUST THE PRICE IS UP!!!!!! \*^(limit orders below the market price)

So, for this stock to gain momentum and move its price in an upward direction the only way to do that successfully with small share buys is with a MARKET order. Market orders eat up all waiting limit sell orders and the price will keep moving upward. Market orders are guaranteed to fill and have no risk for adding downward pressure on the price action. However, there are some risks to market orders like getting bad fills. Generally speaking, this is not a great investment strategy for ANY OTHER STOCK. For GME it's different because the goal is different. The GME hypothesis is a very large payout miles above its current price so getting a bad fill isn't really supposed to matter. Yes, PFOF (Payment for order flow) relies on market orders and HFT (High Frequency Trading) can "front run" a market order but again, this isn't going to affect the overall GME strategy of Buy & Hold.

Limit Orders cap risk. Limit orders make sure you do not overpay for a share of stock and Limit orders are a very good idea for buying stock. If you are not using limit orders to buy your shares for your overall portfolio I suggest you learn how to use them because they are incredibly valuable.  Many people in the comments are very passionate about why Limit orders are a much smarter move and I will have to agree with them overall but there is a VERY important detail about Limit orders that must be understood if you don't want to have them used against you.

Limit Buy orders that are BELOW the Market actually create downward momentum and give market makers opportunities to adjust the price downward. IF you are going to cap your risk and use a Limit order PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL APES, make sure your limit order is ABOVE the market price. How much above the market price is up to you. A limit order above market acts like a market order until the market price rises above your order. This is essentially a market order with a price cap. The only risk is that the price rises too quickly and you get left in the dust unfilled, or worse the price rises past your order and then you are filled below the market price, slowing down the upward momentum.

My opinion on best order types for buying shares of GME (best to worst)

1.	Market Order
2.	Limit Order at or above Ask
3.	Limit Order below Market (DO NOT DO THIS)

There are literally dozens of other order types and this is not the post to get into them all. I only wanted to discuss the most commonly used order types, their merits, and faults.

I hope this makes sense. This does not include off-book, dark pools, options,etc and how they influence the NBBO. This is just the basic level of order books operation but it offers a powerful tool for market makers to drop the price.

~~Edit: if you are not convinced and you still want to buy shares, the best buy limit order you can do is whatever the ASK is currently at. That will get filled the fastest without adding downside pressure. Its not the rocket boost a market order can provide but its a good swift kick upward.~~

~~Edit 2: the ONLY problem I see with a limit buy at the Ask is if the price is in fast upward movement. You run the risk of placing this order and having the price rise above it before its filled. Suddenly your limit buy order is below the price and not above it. If it gets filled, it will be breaking the upward momentum.~~
