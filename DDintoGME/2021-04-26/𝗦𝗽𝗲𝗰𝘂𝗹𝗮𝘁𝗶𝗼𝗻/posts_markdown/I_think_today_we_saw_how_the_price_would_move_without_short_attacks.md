There were almost no shares borrowed and a lot returned. New laws are in action and other posts stated that there was No(less) trading in dark Pools. So I think that today we saw a real day with a lot of buys and some sells, and the price would have moved up like this without Manipulation.
Sorry no real evidance besides having read every DD and watched the price move all day for the last 4 months
