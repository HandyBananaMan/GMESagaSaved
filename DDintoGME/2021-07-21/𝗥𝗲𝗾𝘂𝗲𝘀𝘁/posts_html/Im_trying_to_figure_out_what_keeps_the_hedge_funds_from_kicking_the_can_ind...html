<h1>Title: I'm trying to figure out what keeps the hedge funds from kicking the can indefinitely. Can anyone point me to some DD that explains why they can't in detail?</h1>

<p>July buyer. Just curious what stops them from creating synthetic shares forever, married puts, etc.</p>
<p>EDIT: obligatory thanks for gold. I appreciate the view points of those who responded. I will admit that I am a skeptic despite my positions. However, at this point, MOASS or not, I'm long on GME/AMC. I'm not selling unless I hit life changing money. If that doesn't happen, and they're somehow able to manipulate these companies into bankruptcy then I'll watch it burn. </p>
<p>People like this destroyed the market when I was a young man, and the thing that has me convinced above everything else is the disinformation campaign and the attempts to get retail to liquidate their positions. If it was all true, these companies are worthless, it's a bad position, etc. Then these people absolutely would not care. </p>
<p>But they do. </p>
<p>These hands are made of Diamond. Thanks again everyone.</p>
