I appreciate the view points of those who responded. I will admit that I am a skeptic despite my positions. However, at this point, MOASS or not, I'm long on GME/AMC. I'm not selling unless I hit life changing money. If that doesn't happen, and they're somehow able to manipulate these companies into bankruptcy then I'll watch it burn. \n\nPeople like this destroyed the market when I was a young man, and the thing that has me convinced above everything else is the disinformation campaign and the attempts to get retail to liquidate their positions. If it was all true, these companies are worthless, it's a bad position, etc. Then these people absolutely would not care. \n\nBut they do. \n\nThese hands are made of Diamond. Thanks again everyone.",
