I was looking to see if I can learn how the coding for HFT work and what makes up the algorithm, obviously I got side tracked.\n\nI was looking at [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/289016/11-1226-dr7-crashes-and-high-frequency-trading.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjO_oqv1fTxAhWC0eAKHZC7D_wQFjAAegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw2H-IKF6nh2ljGDy04mMKY6&cshid=1626887969482) regarding crashes and HFT and in there there was a reference to a website called [**financial crash observatory**](http://tasmania.ethz.ch/pubfco/fco.html). Now bare in mind this is UK government document refrence so I was very curious to see what it was.\n\nTurns out it is exactly that, a website that shows the possibility of a crash, it uses a technique called Log- periodic power law (LPPL) within their models. They have ran number of [case studies ](http://tasmania.ethz.ch/pubfco/Bubbles_binder.pdf) on previous crashes and guess which fucking market is currently signalling the most? S&P500.\n\nHonestly I didn't even know such a thing existed or how accurate it is, but if UK government references it then be sure as shit that it  carries some weight.\n\nAlso here is a [Ted talk](https://youtu.be/C_eFjLZqXt8) from professor Didier Sornette, the dude who came up with FCO. Honestly this guy fucks.\n\nI call upon THEE wrinkle brained to help and see whats up with this bad boy\n\nI'm not wrinkle brained enough. BUT BUT I specially like how there is a [spike](https://imgur.com/gallery/3sh0bV8)in his model everytime there has been a spike in GME. Like totally not related at all to one another. (Blue is s&p 500, red is Lppl). \n\n\nAlso if you happen to go on the site, each red means inflated bubble and green means deflated bubble.\n\n\nYe so go ahead, help an ape out.",
