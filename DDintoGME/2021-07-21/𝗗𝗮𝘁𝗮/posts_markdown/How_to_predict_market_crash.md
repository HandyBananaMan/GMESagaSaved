If you look hard enough on the Internet, you'll find anything. 

-dude behind wendies.


I wasn't even looking for an answer to that question.  I was looking to see if I can learn how the coding for HFT work and what makes up the algorithm, obviously I got side tracked.

I was looking at [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/289016/11-1226-dr7-crashes-and-high-frequency-trading.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjO_oqv1fTxAhWC0eAKHZC7D_wQFjAAegQIBhAC&usg=AOvVaw2H-IKF6nh2ljGDy04mMKY6&cshid=1626887969482) regarding crashes and HFT and in there there was a reference to a website called [**financial crash observatory**](http://tasmania.ethz.ch/pubfco/fco.html). Now bare in mind this is UK government document refrence so I was very curious to see what it was.

Turns out it is exactly that, a website that shows the possibility of a crash, it uses a technique called Log- periodic power law (LPPL) within their models. They have ran number of [case studies ](http://tasmania.ethz.ch/pubfco/Bubbles_binder.pdf) on previous crashes and guess which fucking market is currently signalling the most? S&P500.

Honestly I didn't even know such a thing existed or how accurate it is, but if UK government references it then be sure as shit that it  carries some weight.

Also here is a [Ted talk](https://youtu.be/C_eFjLZqXt8) from professor Didier Sornette, the dude who came up with FCO. Honestly this guy fucks.

I call upon THEE wrinkle brained to help and see whats up with this bad boy

I'm not wrinkle brained enough. BUT BUT I specially like how there is a ![spike](https://imgur.com/gallery/3sh0bV8)in his model everytime there has been a spike in GME. Like totally not related at all to one another. (Blue is s&p 500, red is Lppl). 


Also if you happen to go on the site, each red means inflated bubble and green means deflated bubble.


Ye so go ahead, help an ape out.
