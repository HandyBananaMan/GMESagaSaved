<p>If you look hard enough on the Internet, you'll find anything. </p>
<p>-dude behind wendies.</p>
<p>I wasn't even looking for an answer to that question.  I was looking to see if I can learn how the coding for HFT work and what makes up the algorithm, obviously I got side tracked.</p>
<p>I was looking at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/289016/11-1226-dr7-crashes-and-high-frequency-trading.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjO_oqv1fTxAhWC0eAKHZC7D_wQFjAAegQIBhAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw2H-IKF6nh2ljGDy04mMKY6&amp;cshid=1626887969482">this</a> regarding crashes and HFT and in there there was a reference to a website called <a href="http://tasmania.ethz.ch/pubfco/fco.html"><strong>financial crash observatory</strong></a>. Now bare in mind this is UK government document refrence so I was very curious to see what it was.</p>
<p>Turns out it is exactly that, a website that shows the possibility of a crash, it uses a technique called Log- periodic power law (LPPL) within their models. They have ran number of <a href="http://tasmania.ethz.ch/pubfco/Bubbles_binder.pdf">case studies </a> on previous crashes and guess which fucking market is currently signalling the most? S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>Honestly I didn't even know such a thing existed or how accurate it is, but if UK government references it then be sure as shit that it  carries some weight.</p>
<p>Also here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/C_eFjLZqXt8">Ted talk</a> from professor Didier Sornette, the dude who came up with FCO. Honestly this guy fucks.</p>
<p>I call upon THEE wrinkle brained to help and see whats up with this bad boy</p>
<p>I'm not wrinkle brained enough. BUT BUT I specially like how there is a <img alt="spike" src="https://imgur.com/gallery/3sh0bV8" />in his model everytime there has been a spike in GME. Like totally not related at all to one another. (Blue is s&amp;p 500, red is Lppl). </p>
<p>Also if you happen to go on the site, each red means inflated bubble and green means deflated bubble.</p>
<p>Ye so go ahead, help an ape out.</p>
