<p>I wanted to offer a counter DD to the low volume leaderboard folks. While I 100% agree that the low volume we are seeing is possible evidence of SHFs running out of ammo, I would like to remind folks that late summer is one of the driest periods across the entire stock market. I decided to break down the daily average volume broken down by month going back to 2002 when I assume GME IPO'd.</p>

<p>The results:</p>

<p>Just as I suspected...July has always been the driest month of the trading year for GME.</p>

<p>Again, don't completely unjack your tits over these record low volumes we have been seeing. Just keep in mind that the stock market is seasonal and cyclical. My philosophy is that it's always good to have a variety of information from a variety of perspectives.</p>

<p>Edit: So thanks to some wise comments, I was looking into the relationship to shares outstanding counts over the course of the stonk. I'm working on redoing the data as % of total shares outstanding to provide more depth...anyways, I'm searching articles from July-Sept 2019 to figure out what the hell was going on with the 13M shares outstanding datapoint <a href="https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/gme/">shown here</a> (I now believe this was a mistake). And HOLY SHIT I found an interesting little easter egg that I've never seen before:</p>
<p><img alt="Check this shit out, bois!!!" src="https://preview.redd.it/hnfg79ydrod71.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bb6e7abf7d7a3ab68d5799f205daffe7b9595af" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit 2: I have gone thru the work of adding the historical shares outstanding to the data sheet according to <a href="https://ycharts.com">ycharts.com</a> data (lets hope it's right). <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RNV_-c2dFUGxdIK8hHZnGl5r-9O7cp0qT6ok_YNtyIE/edit?usp=sharing">QUANT APES HAVE AT IT!!!</a></p>
<p>I will redo the analysis tomorrow showing the % of shares outstanding traded by month and we will see if my hypothesis holds true. Also plan to break it down yearly to show the progression more.</p>
