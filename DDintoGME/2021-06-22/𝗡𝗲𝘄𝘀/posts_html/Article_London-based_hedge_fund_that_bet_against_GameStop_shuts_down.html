<p>[BENGALURU] A London-based hedge fund that suffered losses betting against US retailer GameStop during the first meme stock rally in January is shutting down, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>White Square Capital has told investors that it will shut its main fund and return capital this month after a review of its business model, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the fund and a letter to investors.</p>
<p>White Square suffered double-digit per cent losses in January, the report added.</p>
<p>The firm did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside of regular UK business hours.</p>
