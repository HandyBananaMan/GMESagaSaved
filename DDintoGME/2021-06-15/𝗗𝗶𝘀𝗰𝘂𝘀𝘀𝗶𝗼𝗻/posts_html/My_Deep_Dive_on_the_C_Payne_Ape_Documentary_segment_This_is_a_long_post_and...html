<p>I noticed red flags about the documentary featured on C. Payne's programme and went to analyze them in detail.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I really can't do a tldr for this, please read the whole thing.</p>
<p>Original post for reference:

<p>The original video for timecode references: https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q </p>
<p>Initially it felt off. This comes out of left field and the way it's presented and the weird timing of it, at least made me want to take a closer look, and apply critical thinking.</p>
<p>Immediately I picked up on how terribly vague and empty the conversation in the segment is, and also in the trailer. <em>It's like nobody wants to discuss any DD, not even the filmmakers nor the apes in the trailer</em>. <strong>they edited atobitt's parts together from several pieces, so that what he says is essentially meaningless without the proper context</strong>. at 0:52 https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q?t=52 (I transcribed it below and go over it in detail)</p>
<p>so I listened again, more carefully and noticed so many red flags, I just couldn't stop digging.</p>
<ul>
<li>the trailer of the documentary does <em>not</em> mention GameStop, GME, Citadel, short selling, naked short selling, any of the DD, moass, buying and holding, memes, ape culture, it's incredibly empty of substance. from 0:15 https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q?t=15</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most damning part of the whole segment to me, how little actual value there is, when you really try to look for it. It's impossible to tell from the trailer they showed, if the documentary is even supposed to be about GME, movie stonk, or both. <em>Regular viewers who aren't already familiar with the context and the story, will get zero information from this segment.</em></p>
<p>Most of the references to this saga are only <em>alluded to</em>, but never stated outright, and lack the proper context to understand it.</p>
<p>There's no mention of Naked Shorts or Citadel, the DTCC in the entire segment, but the filmmakers rather attack <strong>the other</strong> media, and awkwardly <em>name-drop</em> words like "dips", "fundamentals", organized crime mafia, and reference a number of memes <em>as if crossing off a checklist</em>. While also providing as little real substance as possible, at the same time.</p>
<p>This is really extremely blatant to me, once you see the pattern. They only mention GameStop on one occasion, 4 minutes into the 5 minute segment, as name drop, after dancing around it the entire time. Remember, they don't even mention it in the "trailer" we saw.</p>
<p>but I digress. continuing the initial red flags I notied:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the segment is pulling emotional strings to push Apes' buttons, in a manipulative way, I get into that in detail with examples, below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the filmmakers only criticize (other) media outlets, and literally nothing else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suddenly there's a "documentary" on apes &amp; superstonk that I never heard of before even though I lurk 24/7. it happened seemingly overnight (and the initial comment sentiment doesn't even seem to question this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we learn it's only a trailer, and they plan to "capture stories" and that's why they need money and donations. But they're already showing several supposed apes in the trailer, like they already interviewed them. yet they do not have any actual stories. they only ever reference the word "stories", and the only "story" viewers get from this clip, is the story of the filmmakers. nothing adds up. is the movie already made, or not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kenny &amp; Cramer already pulled this stunt with a documentary once, with a Fud show about WSB on Hulu remember?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never heard of those 2 apes who made the film, and I don't know their reddit usernames. this entire project seems to have been conducted without the subreddit knowing anything about it. None of the apes in the trailer, shared the fact that a segment was coming up and that they got interviewed for it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The filmmakers want donations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DFV does not appear or get mentioned anywhere in the entire segment. However, they use DFV's voiceover without context one single time, which is manipulation because only apes pick up on it (and everybody else still learns exactly <em>nothing</em> about DFV). at 0:42 https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q?t=42 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This voiceover is an example of the kind of manipulation that is designed to appeal to you</strong>, while being <em>unrecognizable for the uninformed viewer</em>. it's meant to push Apes' buttons, <em>and only apes</em>.</p>
<p>This also applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the falling cards visual. <em>only apes make the connection to HoC</em>. <strong>but of course they'll never discuss our mention the actual HoC DD.</strong> they obviously <em>know</em> about it. but all they do with it is dangle it in your face like a carrot, without anyone else noticing. at 0:51 https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q?t=51</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The trailer and segment keeps using suggestive flashes of images, that trigger a positive mental association in apes, but they are placed in a way that renders them ultimately meaningless to a regular viewer who does not have the context, and isn't getting it from the segment either.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The flash second of Dr. Trimbath's face, but of course they never mention her, or the importance of her work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flash second of superstonk, but they never say the word superstonk or anything about the subreddit.  and of course later they bring up the usual fud about r/wsb again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the flash of superstonk is at 0:19 https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q?t=19</p>
<p>the return to the regular wsb FUD is at 3:40 https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q?t=19</p>
<p>These flashes and meme references, are meant to hook Apes, but they do not actually communicate any real information to a regular viewer. They're ultimately meaningless to anyone else, this is by design. <em>It's a dog whistle.</em></p>
<p>The entire segment is riddled with this targetted mindfuckery.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at which parts of the Dr. Trimbath AmA the filmmakers decided to put in their actual trailer, which they premiered on Charles' show. I transcribed it word for word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>atobitt: What we're trying to say here, is that there are these shares that are just kind of floating around and being borrowed and being lent, and being lent again [audio cuts] we just know, that there's more shares out there than [audio cuts] the company had originally issued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I too was happy when I saw atobitt, I love that ape, this confirms my bias. But the way it's edited, isn't that... terribly vague and devoid of substance? Try if you can find the words "GME", "Citadel", or "naked shorts", or anything of any interest, for that matter. <em>it's edited to be exactly that way.</em> Remember, "Ape filmmakers" handpicked this line to use in their trailer, on the big night in the big trailer premiere.</p>
<p>Does that feel like the line <em>you</em> would choose? "We're trying to say there's shares kinda floating around"?</p>
<p>This is the sneaky part, Apes <em>already know the context</em>, and see their bias confirmed. <em>but that's not what an uninformed viewer sees</em>. do me a favor and rewatch it without the rose tinted goggles. "there are these shares that are just kinda floating around"..? Guys, this isn't a flattering depiction, they're perpetuating the dumb money cliche, by twisting his words, and cherrypicking and leaving off the context. "we JUST know that there are more shares", no Charles, the truth is we know so much more than that. they're intentionally making atobitt look dumb by using "shares kinda floating around" out of context.</p>
<p>At the same time they're using atobitt's face to gain Apes' trust, <em>but edited the words to say literally nothing useful, if you're not already in on everything</em>.</p>
<p>It's the same trick when they use DFV's voice, but not his face at 0:42. "it's alarming how little we know, about the inner workings of the market". again "we know little", okay. and again this line says absolutely nothing of real value about what's going on. It only says "Apes are clueless". like the atobitt example, and most of the segment.</p>
<p>You can find this complete empty vagueness of saying absolutely nothing at all, throughout the entire video. And the emotional manipulation. </p>
<hr />
<p>Then there's the first question Charles asks the filmmakers, word by word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CP: alright and here are the filmmakers, Finley and Quinn Mulligan and, First of all guys, congratulations on the documentary. When I first saw it, it brought a lump to my throat a tear to my eyes, when I saw the trailer. So what inspired you to make this in the first place?</p>
<p>Thanks Charles, first off, thanks for having us on the show we appreciate the platform. What first inspired us to make this film, are the people, and you saw all of those people in the trailer that you watched. They were robbed, in January, just like us we've been in this from the start, and as things went on and we watched the Mainstream Media make fun of, disparage, denigrate, these normal everyday people, we decided we had to stand up, use our own voice, and tell their stories the best way we knew how, which is filmmaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe you took those words with friendly eyes, biased to see a fellow ape. but look how empty and vague every single thing he says is. the closest he comes to saying something, is "people were robbed in January" wow, that's it, "somebody got robbed" can it get any more vague? Again no mention of Citadel, naked shorts, manipulation, the actual DD, or even the fact that brilliant DD exists and that people should read it. No mention of DFV (I thought they said they were in it "from the start", whatever they even mean by that. before January? yet you never mention DFV?)</p>
<p>If you turn off emotion, you can see that these words basically sound like they were written by the same guy that wrote Vlad's answers for the hearing. look again, these sentences are designed to appeal to you, while saying exactly nothing at all also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks Charles, first off, thanks for having us on the <em>$show</em> we appreciate the platform. What first inspired us to make <em>this $film</em>, are <em>the $people</em>, and you saw all of <em>those $people</em> in <em>the $trailer that you watched. </em>They<em> were robbed, in $January, just like us we've been </em>in this from the $start<em>, and as </em>$things went on<em> and we watched </em>the $msm<em> make fun of, disparage, denigrate, these </em>normal everyday $people<em>, we decided we had to </em>stand up, use our own voice<em>, and tell </em>their $stories* the best way we knew how, which is $filmmaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Things went on". Seriously. "Things went on", is how they choose to summarize 6 months of sophisticated psychological warfare and manipulation of the global markets. I'm getting serious boy in Bulgaria vibes. It's pure meaningless fluff, and <strong>there's no information in any of this that is useful to an uninformed viewer</strong>.</p>
<p>On the third question, the filmmaker drops a number of memes &amp; references, randomly, and he sounds pretty much incoherent. I need to spell this part out again, and it's good to rewatch it too, his delivery is worse than Vlad's imo. https://youtu.be/jRD-zU5vu0Q?t=215</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it embolden the $community? [talking about a Bloomberg article trashing WSB]</p>
<p>Absolutely, if they want to talk about mafia and organized crime, they can look in a mirror [Bloomberg, apparently]. We have been absolutely amazed, astounded by the pathetic nature that so many news networks and media companies have been portraying us. [really, only the media astounded you and you're not gonna mention anything else?]</p>
<p>Any investor will tell you that the best thing you gotta do is not fear the dips, trust your, uh Due Diligence, and if nothing's changed in your fundamentals, you hang on. You know GameStop for instance, we're long on that stock, the company's full of Amazon execs, isn't going anywhere. But the articles still say, "forget GameStop, what's the next reddit stock". This is not a reddit movement anymore , this has moved beyond that, these are normal people that love their stocks like Am¢ and GameStop, and they'll keep holding it as long as they believe in their fundamentals. This is basic investing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard where to even begin here. Note how they keep bringing up other FUD to "laugh" and whine about it, but no substance. Again they dance around ideas like "buy and hold" and fundamentals, <strong>but they do not say the actual words or provide real valuable insights</strong>. hold becomes "hang on", buy the dip becomes "not fear the dips", liking the stock becomes "we're long on that stock". they choose the words "we're long" carefully, because the expression won't be understood by as many people as if they outright said, "we keep BUYING that stock".</p>
<p>saying the words "we're long on" is meant to appeal to apes, and <em>still</em> not be understood by most regular viewers. manipulation, dog-whistling.</p>
<p>In the whole answer, the guy is intentionally coming across as whiny, cocky, and delusional.</p>
<p>Apes are not this arrogant and cocky. This is obviously not an Ape, his character is <em>the elites' negative perception of an Ape, with all the bad attributes</em>, and every other word is a tell. "any investor will tell you", "this is basic investing", "this is beyond reddit now these are <em>normal</em> people" (so you're saying, redditors aren't normal people? you misunderstood this mr filmmaker, it's that Apes are just normal people. we're normal individuals).</p>
<p>The memes and bananas are meant to distract you from the fact that this is a backhanded smear piece.</p>
<hr />
<p>Once I looked at it critically, it really stands out what a hack job this is, and these guys are <em>terrible</em> actors. You can immediately tell that he only knows a list of bullet points he received, and mindlessly repeats them, just like Vlad did. There is no movie, all they have was this 30 second piece of targeted psychological manipulation, and a bunch of vague references to memes and bananas.</p>
<p><strong>This dance around the truth, alluding to truth but never really say it or give context, is the guiding theme of the entire segment</strong>, and every talking point they use, was carefully crafted with this goal in mind. You can see that in the result, in plain sight.</p>
<p>Even the mention of the word GameStop was strategically placed, to happen when it happened, <em>couched</em> by other memes and nonsense. To discredit it.</p>
<p>The guy recording the clip, is part of it too by the way. He interacts at 3 specific key moments that are designed to hook apes.</p>
<p>"hey that's me" at 0:20 </p>
<p>"meme Mafia lol" at 3:36</p>
<p>"lol banana" at 4:55</p>
<p>All his interactions have an intention, to hook you <em>and make apes appear dumb to the rest of the world</em>. The guy is a terrible actor by the way, and you can pick up on this.</p>
<hr />
<p>C. Payne has shown his true face, and boy, it's twisted as fuck. Zoom out to get perspective:</p>
<p>The point is to hijack the narrative, discredit apes, install Payne as trojan horse and as someone who speaks for Apes on tv.</p>
<p>His actions are the opposite of what he says. </p>
<p>This is very sneaky because if you're not paying attention, you can easily fall for the manipulation and Charles' superficial asskissery. I wasn't sure before and tried to keep and open mind about Charles, but this absolutely insane stunt, seals it for me.</p>
<p>I believe they are now trying to frame Apes as a kooky movement for the long play, while also setting up Payne as a Trojan horse for the short term things. Payne is FOX' Cramer and he's playing the exact same game.</p>
<p>And they're trying extremely hard to mix the politics in now, just to make things even more fuddy and divisive.</p>
<p>Apes don't need pre-moass documentaries. after moass is the time for that.</p>
<p>Ape don't need MSM.</p>
<p>Buy and hold is all that matters.</p>
