# Updates - Last updated 3rd May @ 06:15 EST

**I've taken a much-needed break from updates and am back at it today - got a backlog of hunted DD to include. Check back for a big update.**

&#x200B;

   * Added list of links on top (*work in progress*)
   * Removed Newcomers list of links -> Moved contents to [Resources Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ddintogme/wiki/resources#wiki_must_know_information_as_a_gme_shareholder)
* **Adding now:**

   * adding more detailed TLDR & Takeaways to each link

&#x200B;

## Current main FUD tactics

* Thousands of account raiding threads with up/downvotes, awards and spam
* Divide and conquer working
* Flooding other subs with bullshit - including conspiracy crap - trying to wear us out. Put on your bullshit-filter spectacles
* [Shill recruitment: Paying $100/post for FUD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msd0g5/exposing_a_shill_recruitment_company_offering/)
* Attempting to associate the sub to any form of group (political/religous/etc) to discredit and separate us
* Downvoting bots attacking trending in 'Hot'
* Urging not to transfer to a better broker - some brokers allow you to sell in limbo so call up each broker and ask yourself to see if it's possible
* the usual psychological attacks - do we even get these anymore?

# ðŸ’Ž The List ðŸ’Ž

Double-check, verify everything you read and trust nothing blindly. Few posts have 0 speculation, and most of which have a degree of misinformation. Stay vigilant and don't gobble anything up for the truth without questioning everything.
