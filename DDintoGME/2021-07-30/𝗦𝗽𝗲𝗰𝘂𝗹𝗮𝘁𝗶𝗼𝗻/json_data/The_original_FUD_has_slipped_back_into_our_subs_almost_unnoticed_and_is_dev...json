    "selftext": "\nI've noticed a pretty serious downward creep in the assumed approximate true SI%. For a while I was hearing 900%, then 550%, and now for the last month or so, 200%. Whether it's being posted by shills or not, this sure seems like FUD. It matters a lot because if we know a minimum of volume to look for during MOASS, we have the best anti-paperhand tool possible: the \\\\\\*for sure knowledge\\\\\\* that apes are holding and the squeeze ain't squoze. I am not going to be counting trades to time my exit. I believe that a well executed FUD campaign during MOASS could use this number to great effect on less well informed apes, and it should be brought up so no one ends up worrying about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBEGIN EDIT: I thought this was old and somewhat settled DD, and it has gotten a lot of attention. In the comments, u/Criand's DD comes up as a recent example of 2xx% being mentioned. Here's his response to this post, in the comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/oug0jr/the_original_fud_has_slipped_back_into_our_subs/h744g3k?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nClearly, a fair reason to bring up the 226%, I'll happily admit now. I did not intend to use any of the usual DD writers as examples of 2xx% propogating - I'm here to point out that the SI% we all have in our heads has been subtley guided downward gradually, and this is the kind of FUD that seeps into group psyche. \n\nu/ammoprofit very concisely explained the counterarguments in his comment:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/oug0jr/the_original_fud_has_slipped_back_into_our_subs/h75some?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nSome apes - see my discussion with u/broccaaa below - think it is better to go with the 226% because it is the only thing we know for sure, so attempts to estimate the true SI% are meaningless. \nMy counterargument to this is that we can make several reasonable calculations to approximate the lower bound, and that's better than just saying the January pre-sneeze figure. More importantly, if we don't attempt to approximate a lower bound, we leave the question open for shills to answer quietly and gradually. This is the ONE number they have to hide. We should be sniffing it out. \n\nThanks to the r/DDintoGME mods for prioritizing peer review and accessibility for new apes while we're all strapped to this rocket. \nEND EDIT\n&#x200B;\n\nIn February, this DD was posted in GME and received critical acclaim - credit to u/moonski :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m19oh7/true\\\\\\_short\\\\\\_interest\\\\\\_could\\\\\\_be\\\\\\_anywhere\\\\\\_from\\\\\\_250\\\\\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m19oh7/true_short_interest_could_be_anywhere_from_250_to/)\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m19oh7/true\\_short\\_interest\\_could\\_be\\_anywhere\\_from\\_250\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m19oh7/true_short_interest_could_be_anywhere_from_250_to/))\n\nAnd the general consensus was that the true short interest was likely at or around 900%, or would soon get there and continue. This is the central question of the MOASS thesis - you may know it as, 'how much more than the float does retail own?', or 'how much do we need to hold forever to cause an unending puddle?'\n\nOP also mentions - in a post 5 months ago - that FINRA slipped up and mentioned 226% SI on January 15th, which we somewhat recently found in the discovery documents of the RH class action suit, the exact SI% and date. OP was right about that, and he was right that SI was probably around 967%.\n\nThis SI% downward creep in our subs is absolutely the work of shills, guys, and it's the original MOAFUD. It's what they bought the media for. Don't forget the ads they took out, don't forget the anchors they have on payroll, don't forget CNBC lying to your face for months. Don't let them get your paperhands when you see the volume hit 3-5 times the float, thinking you're gonna end up bagholding. EASILY enough of us are holding for the inf pool. How will we know the MOASS when we see it? \n\nWe'll probably see a 100% buy ratio with 1 billion volume before we return to floor. If we ever come back down.",
