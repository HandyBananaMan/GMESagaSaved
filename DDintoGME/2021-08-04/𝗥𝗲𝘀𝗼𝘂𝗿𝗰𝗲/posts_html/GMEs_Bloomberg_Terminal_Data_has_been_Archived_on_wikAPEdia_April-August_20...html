<h1>0. TLDR</h1>
<p>There was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovexns/i_think_it_is_incredibly_important_that_we_backup/">request</a> to back up GME's Bloomberg Terminal data. It is now archived on <a href="https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia/tree/main/Data/GME-Bloomberg-Terminal-Information-by-Ravada">wikAPEdia</a>.</p>

<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>I have been compiling, organizing, and archiving relevant GME content in <a href="https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia">Github</a> since early 2021.</p>
<p>Thanks to you brilliant apes, I have been able to identify some themes and organize them into their own compilations.  Some examples include <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Meticulous-">Must Read/Serious Due Diligence, Resources, Wealth Management and Regulations</a>. </p>
<p><strong>All of these compilations can now be found on wikAPEdia's</strong> <a href="https://verymeticulous.github.io/wikAPEdia/"><strong>website</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>
<h1>2. Bloomberg Data</h1>
<p>All of u/Ravada's Bloomberg screenshots are now backed up on Github, in case the internet breaks.</p>
<p><strong>I will continue to frequently update the directory daily or weekly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It looks like some days starting in June and July are missing (or I am struggling to find them on Reddit). Please DM me if there are resources I can archive related to GME's Bloomberg Terminal data.</p>

<h1>3. Credit</h1>
<p>This resource could not have been created without u/Ravada. Thank you for continuing to post Bloomberg Terminal updates. Your work is invaluable!</p>
