# 0. TLDR

There was a [request](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovexns/i_think_it_is_incredibly_important_that_we_backup/) to back up GME's Bloomberg Terminal data. It is now archived on [wikAPEdia](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia/tree/main/Data/GME-Bloomberg-Terminal-Information-by-Ravada).

# 1. Overview

I have been compiling, organizing, and archiving relevant GME content in [Github](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia) since early 2021.

Thanks to you brilliant apes, I have been able to identify some themes and organize them into their own compilations.  Some examples include [Must Read/Serious Due Diligence, Resources, Wealth Management and Regulations](https://www.reddit.com/user/Meticulous-). 

**All of these compilations can now be found on wikAPEdia's** [**website**](https://verymeticulous.github.io/wikAPEdia/)**!**

# 2. Bloomberg Data

All of u/Ravada's Bloomberg screenshots are now backed up on Github, in case the internet breaks.

**I will continue to frequently update the directory daily or weekly.**

>**Note:** It looks like some days starting in June and July are missing (or I am struggling to find them on Reddit). Please DM me if there are resources I can archive related to GME's Bloomberg Terminal data.

# 3. Credit

This resource could not have been created without u/Ravada. Thank you for continuing to post Bloomberg Terminal updates. Your work is invaluable!

**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advise, nor am I a financial advisor. I just like to organize things.
