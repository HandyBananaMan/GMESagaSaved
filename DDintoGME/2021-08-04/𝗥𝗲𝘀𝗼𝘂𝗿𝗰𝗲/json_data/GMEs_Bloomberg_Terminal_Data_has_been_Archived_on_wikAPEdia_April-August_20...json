It is now archived on [wikAPEdia](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia/tree/main/Data/GME-Bloomberg-Terminal-Information-by-Ravada).\n\n[It ain't much](https://preview.redd.it/ikdp5ze1cdf71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c48975df91258ac74249775a8611a39c4e81a64)\n\n# 1. Overview\n\nI have been compiling, organizing, and archiving relevant GME content in [Github](https://github.com/verymeticulous/wikAPEdia) since early 2021.\n\nThanks to you brilliant apes, I have been able to identify some themes and organize them into their own compilations.  Some examples include [Must Read/Serious Due Diligence, Resources, Wealth Management and Regulations](https://www.reddit.com/user/Meticulous-). \n\n**All of these compilations can now be found on wikAPEdia's** [**website**](https://verymeticulous.github.io/wikAPEdia/)**!**\n\n# 2. Bloomberg Data\n\nAll of u/Ravada's Bloomberg screenshots are now backed up on Github, in case the internet breaks.\n\n**I will continue to frequently update the directory daily or weekly.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Note:** It looks like some days starting in June and July are missing (or I am struggling to find them on Reddit). Please DM me if there are resources I can archive related to GME's Bloomberg Terminal data.\n\n# 3. Credit\n\nThis resource could not have been created without u/Ravada. Thank you for continuing to post Bloomberg Terminal updates. Your work is invaluable!\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advise, nor am I a financial advisor. I just like to organize things.",
