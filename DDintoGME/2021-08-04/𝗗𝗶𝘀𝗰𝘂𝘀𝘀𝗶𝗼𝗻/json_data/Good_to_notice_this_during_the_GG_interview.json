    "selftext": "He mentioned he got tweets about darkpools etc, and got into it. Meaning he actually reads tweets with information and concerns, and looks into the matter. AKA send him good solid DD to his twitter, to help him in the right direction. Really some DD some of the apes here do is some Einstein wrinkled brain stuff, that might take them a while to find out. So help GG-Guy out.   \nI hope he proves himself a good guy, and I can refer to him as GG-GG in the future. Good Guy Gary Gensler or GAG , Good Ape Gary\n\nEdit: I've just been thinking after some of your replies. If he's not an ape sending him DD may give him some ideas of what we're onto, and could make them hide their shit even better. Maybe send DD straight to the FIB? After all it was them who got guys like for instance Madoff (the biggest ponzi scheme in history guy) and the SEC did nothing too back then.",
