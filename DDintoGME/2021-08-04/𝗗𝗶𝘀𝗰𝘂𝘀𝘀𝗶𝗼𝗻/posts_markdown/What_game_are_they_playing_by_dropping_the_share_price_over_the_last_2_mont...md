I mean, what is their plan here? What is their immediate goal? If they could have dropped the price back to a cover-able level before, presumably they would have tried the "slow bleed" approach before. What has changed to allow them to try it now? What was holding them back before, which is seemingly not as much of a barrier as before? Towards what end and by when?

We are in a frustrating, but still quite fascinating stage of the whole saga. I have one or two of my own theories and ideas for answers to a few of these questions myself. But, would be interested to hear what you Apes on this sub think as well.
