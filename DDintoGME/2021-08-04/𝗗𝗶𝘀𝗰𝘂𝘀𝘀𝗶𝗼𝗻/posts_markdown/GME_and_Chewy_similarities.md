I was recently reading an interview that RC did a while back and couldn't help but notice some of the identical things that he appears to be doing with GME that he did with Chewy.  I'll add some points and personal comments on the way.

Here's the interview from Forbes [https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/)

For me, I have basically shopped at GameStop before it was GameStop.  I used to shop at a store called Software Etc.  [GameStop - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop) That was my go-to store for computer software.  I remember waiting in line the night before to purchase Windows 95 when it first came out.  This is where I also purchased games such as Doom, Duke Nukem 3d, and the original Grand Theft Auto.

When GameStop bought out Software Etc. initially it was a good thing.  They expanded the line of software that was carried previously and started carrying more games for the Nintendo and the Sega.  As time moved on the computer portion of the store shrunk.  Still, I was a loyal customer that would be in there basically every weekend looking for something.

Fast forward quite a few years and I have to admit that I didn't really go in there much.  They carried basically the same stuff that they did before, and if you wanted to sell your games it was basically a joke.  (Viva La Dirt League used to have a video somewhat making fun of it when buying a rare game for something $2 and instantly selling it for $150 or something  [Viva La Dirt League - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/VivaLaDirtLeague/videos), but I can't find the specific video)  So honestly, I kind of quit shopping there. I decided to try it again with the WII when it came out, but wasn't impressed then either.  So I have to confess that until recently I haven't stepped foot in a GameStop since 2014 or so.

I will admit that if the leadership hadn't changed I feel that, sad to say, the SHF were correct that the store was going to die.  In comes RC.  The man with the plan.  I am proud so say that I now hodl stock in this amazing growth company and have shopped there quite a few times recently.  I am impressed with their expanded selection and the speed of their shipping.

So on to the comparison.

"**These were ways we could connect with customers and build loyalty over time, optimizing for a lifetime relationship, not a single transaction.** " - I'd say he is doing that with GS in quite a few ways.  Power Up Rewards, personalized letters, etc.

"**I focused on four pillars and we did them better than anyone else. We started with the value proposition of delighting our customers, which we did through amazing customer service, low prices, fast shipping, and selection.**"

* Delighting our customers - reading through people posting about their recent GS purchases I think it's safe to say that they are delighting their customers.
* Low Prices - same as above reading of people posting that they purchased new TVs and the like that were in stock and cheaper than other competitors
* Fast Shipping - another quote from the same article - " **We opened our first two warehouses in 2014. By 2018 we had seven warehouses around the country and 4.7 million square feet of space.**" Sounds like what they just did with their two warehouses

* Selection - it's always fun to pull up the multiple GME subreddits and see people posting "Did you know they carry..."

" **I needed to hire the best people and delegate into their areas of expertise. Each employee we hired had a strong bias for action and were excited about the opportunity to disrupt the pet industry. We always hired for will over skill. One you can teach, the other you can’t.** "

He is building a company that, even if by some off-the-wall circumstance were to never short squeeze, that I am proud to be a long term investor of as well as a returned long term shopper.  RC and the leadership team is going to do amazing things with this company.

Possibly the most important quote to keep in mind from this article I think should speak to all of us.  I will simply leave you with this quote, and you can do with it as you will.

"**The Type A in me is competitive and loves to win, but the day-to-day feels like you’re losing. If you think you’re winning you’re probably not doing a great job building your company. Even as our sales grew into the billions, I always felt behind. Whether that’s the right mentality or not, that’s how I’m wired.**" - Ryan Cohen
