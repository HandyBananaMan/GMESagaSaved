    "selftext": "NY Fed just released the latest number at 1:16pm ET: $432.9B. Shocked Pikachu, it's higher! It is almost exactly tracking the curve I plotted yesterday. I played with a few other function types and the closest match is still a polynomial, but now an order 2 with R-squared of 0.918, up from 0.885 yesterday.\n\nStill looking to hit $500B by week's end. HOWEVER, according to other DD, reverse repo is not limited at that number, but individual participants are limited to $80B of Treasury borrowing per night, so if there are a few banks that are being big hogs at the trough, they may hit that limit soon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3t5wew58za171.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=0038afb01919581bd0c653f9776c3f717d3ea4c7\n\nOne more thing (doing my best Columbo impersonation): there have been local dips in this number every Monday: 5/10, 5/17, 5/24. No idea why that would happen except maybe reverse repo peaks mid-week? In any event, it might hit $500B before Friday if this week is like the last two.\n\nYesterday's chart: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nk9979/reverse\\_repo\\_overnight\\_lending\\_will\\_hit\\_the\\_upper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nk9979/reverse_repo_overnight_lending_will_hit_the_upper/)  \nFed Repo data: [https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp)  \nSome great DD on the true limit of the reverse repo by u/BlindasBalls: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response\\_to\\_the\\_post\\_about\\_the\\_reverse\\_repo\\_limit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response_to_the_post_about_the_reverse_repo_limit/)  \nHelpful/hilarious post on the Reverse Repo situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nixxvc/fed\\_is\\_in\\_a\\_pickle\\_economy\\_is\\_fuk\\_edition/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nixxvc/fed_is_in_a_pickle_economy_is_fuk_edition/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf):\n\nKeep on HODLin'! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
