<p>I saw the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nk9979/reverse_repo_overnight_lending_will_hit_the_upper/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">post</a> about the reverse repo limit (very well written btw u/HODLTheLineMyFriend) but read some conflicting statements in the comments, so I decided to go on my first solo fact checking tour and looked if these numbers were actually correct.</p>
<p>The 500 billion limit in the post I'm referring to turned out to be for regular repos only, not reverse repos. The 80 billion limit per participant is correct though, and I found something else as well, which might just jack your tits a tiiiiny bit</p>
<p>This is what I found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much of the portfolio of Treasury securities is available for use in RRP operations?  </p>
<p>The FOMC directed the Desk to undertake overnight RRP (ON RRP) operations in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA that are available for such operations. To determine this value, the Desk takes several factors into account, as not all Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA will be available for use in such operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For ON RRP operations, each counterparty is permitted to submit one proposition in a size not to exceed $80 billion and at a rate not to exceed the specified offering rate for each ON RRP operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for the lazy apes, a small summary:</p>
<p>The limit is $80 billion per participant, and total reverse repos are limited to the total value of Treasury securities held in SOMA (minus value reserved for other obligations).</p>
<p>At this moment the total value of SOMA is $7.3 trillion, but this includes numerous things that probably can't be used. An attempt to calculate the actual available amount for RRPs will be done below:</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>EDIT: I will edit this section when we get more information about which parts of SOMA can't be used for reverse repos to get a more accurate calculation of the limit.</p>
<p>After reading this part in above-mentioned source again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What securities are being used for RRP operations?  </p>
<p>The FOMC has directed the Desk to undertake RRP operations using Treasury securities held in the SOMA. The SOMAâ€™s holdings of agency debentures and agency mortgage-backed securities are not currently used in the Deskâ€™s RRP operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can conclude that Agency securities (MBS and CMBS) can be subtracted from the total value, this gives us (calculated in $ Trillion and rounded to 0.001):</p>
<p>7.302-2.268-0.010 = $5.024 Trillion</p>
<p>If we assume that US TIPS are also not used for reverso repos (no actual proof for this so don't take this as gospel) we can subtract another $341 Billion from this number, which gives us a total of:</p>
<p>5.024-0.341 = $4.683 Trillion (of which there might still be some that is not available for reverse repos, for example reverse repos with foreign official accounts)</p>
<p>It appears that there are only 58 total counterparties eligible to use these reverse repos (credit to u/Carb0n12 for being ape enough to look for the list and count every one of them, you are a trooper). Also, the limit was raised to 80B very recently (march 18th 2021) which means that if all 58 counterparties were to use the 80B, the total RRPs would value at 58 x 80B = 4.64T. This is practically the same number as the total available value I calculated above, meaning they probably calculated the 80B limit based of this value (and seems like confirmation that my calculations are correct). </p>

<p>Source of date of limit raise to 80B: https://finadium.com/fed-increases-rrp-limits-from-30-billion-to-80-billion-to-ensure-supply-at-near-0-rates/</p>
<p>Yesterday, already 54 participants used reverse repos, so it's very likely that one of the big banks is going to max out the $80B rather soon, and will be forced to issue margin calls to overleveredged HF's using this bank. THIS COULD BE  BIG!!!</p>

<p>TLDR: Buy, HODL, Vote! Hedgies r fuk and even though the 500 billion limit isn't correct, there IS a limit and they will eventually reach it if it keeps rising like it has the past weeks  ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€</p>
