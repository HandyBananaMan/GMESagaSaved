After Melvin Capital ~~testified~~ lied on 2/18/21, Congresswoman Katharine Manning (D) of North Carolina, decided to invest in Melvin Capital 2-weeks after the hearings. What do you think Ms. Manning did prior to being *elected by the people* to Congress? I'm sure you can take a wild guess...

Okay - now let's just take a minute and let this sink in...marinate on it. So what's the big deal?

***A sitting Congress(wo)man invested*** ***in the same hedge fund*** ***that the Financial Services Committee called on to testify, under oath, 2-weeks before. Tin-foil hat theory - I have no basis in factual data to prove the following statement but it sure would seem like the perfect time to start a little collusion rendezvous', no?***

Now let's look at the flipside and see if it's realistic this is all an innocent misunderstanding. For Melvin, this sum of money isn't material...probably the same for Kathy. So let's say she was living under a rock and had no idea what the hell was going on w/Melvin Capital earlier in 2021. Hmmm. Okay, I could see that. I understand. It's an honest mistake. We all make them, *right*?

~~It's not like the Gamestop Saga was on the news constantly, articles didn't flood the internet and, most importantly...there weren't any Congressional Hearings related to it.~~

Oh wait - ALL OF THAT HAPPENED! Kathy would have to be stupid, inept, or wreckless...none of which are traits I want in an elected official. The point is, I don't see any way there could be an innocent explanation.  The decision here clearly confirms she sees no conflict of interest and more importantly, it's a blatant *go fuck yourself to each and every voter who does see a conflict of interest.*

If we continue voting scumbags like this in office, we deserve every mother fucking thing we get.

**Edit #1:** Manning has solicited and received donations from a LOT of institutional investors. These are just from the first 2 pages.
