<h1>Title: What if additional 5M shares ATM is actually bullish move based on insider SI intel? GME sold 3.5M shares knowing full well it was at least shorted 140%. Perhaps they know SI is well over 200% (140√∑3.5√ó5) and 5M will barely make a ripple.</h1>

<p>There is no denial that RC got into GME knowing the extremely high short interest. The first few moves were to cull planted üêçinsiders, create a vision, shed drowning debt, and mobilize an A-team. The company twitter even mentioned <strong><em>moass</em></strong>, before taking it down. Two recent SEC filings explicitly mention "short squeeze" as risk, and we now know SEC is actively looking into manipulation.</p>
<p>The only question that's left is <strong><em>what is the trigger?</em></strong> This is such a market bomb that, no one, absolutely no one wants that infamy, and deal with investigation/hearings/harassment when the lid blows. Everyone's trying to play by the book. Even SEC keeps formatting "005" because they know it's a trigger.</p>
<p>Perhaps the exponential floor is the noose that slowly chokes Shitadel's capital till Marge wants to liquidate them. The blatant pump-and-dump is a desperate attempt to raise cash beyond Shitdel's recent $600M bond offering. Or perhaps the smaller shorties will take inspiration from Margin Call movie and be the first to cover. Or maybe other banks will follow Jefferies  and BMO to restrict short sale, leaving them with only ETF shorting and synthetic shares to fight rising floor.</p>
<p><strong>One thing seems obvious, no one wants to be seen as initiating the trigger ‚Äî this will have to be organic.</strong> Just BUY / HOLD (not a financial advice).</p>

<p>EDIT 1: <strong>Opinion based on June 10 price action</strong></p>
<p>Price action shows steady linear drop in price, typically seen in <strong><em>iceberg orders</em></strong>. I believe GME didn't waste time in raising cash, and this is super bullish because of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>SHF are caught unaware, so less time to plot</li>
<li>Retailer get their hands on the new issue</li>
<li>Price is going to rebound quickly as most buyers will not paperhand after seeing impressive results even before transformation is in place</li>
<li>It get the job done quickly while raising additional cash for the new CEO</li>
<li>GME is signaling that they will not paperhand during MOASS</li>
<li>Day-traitors get screwed</li>
</ul>

<p>GME didn't waste time. ATM offer completion took 9 trading days and approx. 10% dilution (5M shares) to free float dropped the price by 33% while bringing free cash flow per share to almost $20. New exec compensation is calculated using avg share price between May 27 and June 30. So greenlight from GME starting July 1st. </p>
<p>Ball's now in SEC's court to announce charges against Shitadel and Co. for fraudulent share dilution and harm to investors.</p>
