We welcome speculation and discussion of theories with open arms, so long as everything is stated for what they are. This is not a place meant for entertainment, memes, or the discussion of frivolous topics, and we urge you to make use of other subs for such content.

The front page of the sub is full of memes and other bullshit. It's disappointing. I think the sub should be pure DD.
