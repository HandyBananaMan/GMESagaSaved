<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>N-CSR documents are submitted to the SEC for registered investment management companies.</p>
<p><strong>Why post it?</strong></p>
<p>There seemed to be an incomplete and inaccessible data resource for some Gamestop Shares.</p>
<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>So I went through all the SEC N-CSR forms from 2021-01-01 through to 2021-05-20 <img alt="HERE" src="https://sec.report/Document/Search/" />. Searched for "gamestop", and tabulated all of them under fund and portfolio (if applicable).</p>
<p>N-CSR data is supposed to be uploaded a maximum of 60 days after the end of each quarter. I removed any redundant filings in the period of the search (some had already filed twice). While some aren't super recent, they should be updated by may 30th (60 days after end of Q1).</p>
<p><strong>Why do it?</strong></p>
<p>It was postulated in past posts that \~5,000,000 shares of fidelities institutional holdings were moved to mutual funds since they no longer are reported on their 13f filings. They should show up within these N-CSR filings. Beyond that, it would give us a more accurate picture, at last short term (until votes come in).</p>
<p><strong>How many shares?</strong></p>
<p>As you can see in the linked spreadsheet, we find at least <strong>13,548,582 shares.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You said "at least"?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there is more shares. Unfortunately due to size of some HTML filings I couldn't get some to load at all, some were improperly uploaded on the SEC site, or some seem like they should be listed based on the verbiage but weren't.</p>
<p>There were also ETF holdings which while disclosing their holdings DID NOT list how many shares, simply how the calculation of those holdings would be made.</p>
<p>In cases where those documents could not be accessed, the reason was noted next to the fund.</p>
<p>I will be updating this sheet as new filings come in, those 5,000,000 unaccounted fidelity shares did not seem to show up yet.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking a look!</p>
