**I have linked** [**Ape's Guide to the Galaxy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mnss65/the_apes_guide_to_the_galaxy_a_compilation_of_dds/) **while I post this announcement, will be stickied at the top of the sub again once we have had time to engage with this post as a community.**

&#x200B;

I would like to thank the community for being patient with me, this post is long overdue. First off, in case you haven’t run in to me in the course of my moderating, Hi! I’m u/Theta-voidance and together with u/Chickthief I’ve been doing the bulk of the work for this sub. Our close friend thr0wthis4cc0unt4w4y has taken a step back to focus on his family and infant daughter and will hopefully be back in the near future. Let me preface all of this by saying I absolutely love the little corner of reddit we have cultivated in this sub and I am honored to spend the time I can working on it

There are several concerns that have come up over the past few weeks that need addressing, and we as a community have some important questions to answer about how we’d like to maintain this place moving forward. I am also taking this opportunity to share some subreddit design changes the moderation team is planning ASAP, a data-aggregation project we’ve been working on with some users of the GME Discord to share with the sub, and an idea we had to streamline and improve the DD peer-reviewing process to see what the community thinks.

Because of the other events recently, on the matter of mod drama across the community I have only ![one thing to say](https://imgur.com/a/pvrdPoh). My apologies, that is the only meme you’ll ever see from me, I could not resist. This place was started by thr0w specifically to get away from that dramatic mod bullshit and focus on what the community here finds truly engaging: good research, data, discussion, and theses about GME. That is what this place is for and what it will remain. In the event that another GME sub being on fire increases traffic to this community, first off, welcome new users! Second, please please respect the purpose of this community: well researched DD and discussion about GME and things that might relate to it, nothing else. (Ie: no memes, no promotion, no thoughtless shitposting please, consider the name of the sub: DDintoGME —> does what you are contributing add to the conversation of DD into GME?). Now lets give that situation no more attention that it deserves, lets keep this place civil and drama free please!

# Here are the things we would like to discuss as a community:

&#x200B;

**Content Policy/Guidelines**

Due to IRL time conflicts on the mod team, there was a time that the shitposts and irrelevant content were all over this sub and the content guidelines were not enforced sufficiently. In a community discussion, hundreds of users asked for the content goals of this sub to be taken more seriously and the mod team has been acting accordingly. We ask the users, if you see content that does not contribute to the purpose of this sub please report it for us so we can notice it quickly and remove it.

We are also planning on strengthening the language of the content policy in a more apparent and visible way.

**To be completely crystal clear:**

⁃	No meme posts

⁃	No posts solely for the purpose of humor

⁃	No low effort posts

⁃	No posts that self-promote or promote a particular business

⁃	***Just*** posts that add, information, data, perspective, news, theses, analysis, due diligence,           resources, and thought provoking topics for community discussion

&#x200B;

Please post accordingly, thank you!

&#x200B;

**A couple of questions we ask the community to share its thoughts about:**

⁃	How do we feel as a community about image posts? It would be far easier to prevent memes shitpost content if we didn’t have images, but they can be useful for the purpose of delivering some pieces of good content. Keep images? Limit images more strictly? We are very open to suggestions on this as there is no easy fix. In any case we will remove any shitpost image content we see

⁃	Does anyone have suggestions for a good message to show users before they post to help them ask themselves whether they are submitting the type of  content we as a community would like to see?

&#x200B;

**Steps we as a mod team are planning on taking to be taken in redirecting content:**

⁃	Will ensure that the content policy/goals of the subreddit are presented more visibly and clearly to hopefully prevent/filter some low effort content

⁃	As for the shitposts and memes that do make it through, we will be ramping up a zero tolerance policy. Having made it more explicit and heard back from the community that something needs to be done about the amount of shitpost weeds that have started growing here, we will be removing absolutely anything else that makes it through. We are only human and we do this in our spare time however, so if you see a post that violates the sub’s content policy, please report it! This helps us get to it much more quickly and efficiently.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions from users that we haven’t considered will be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

**Planned Design/Structure Changes**

We will be switching up the stickied posts at the top of the sub in the near future to be a more comprehensive and updated resource that includes both Throws ‘Apes Guide to the Galaxy’ and all subsequent announcements by the moderation team as well as resources for DD and Data as they come up and are found.

&#x200B;

**Community Discussion: Idea to switch to a ‘Community Review’ model for DD Vetting**

This is the thing I am most interested in hearing the community’s thoughts on as it involves an idea to change the format of our sub slightly and I don’t want to overstep beyond what the community wants to see. No doubt you have all noticed the lack of “Reviewed DD” flairs and proper DD vetting in the way the sub was originally proclaimed to be focused upon. There are several inherent issues/bottlenecks with the current way this was supposed to work, and I believe I have a solution.

The main issue is that first off, the names of the DD flairs feel over a certain line to me. “Unverified DD” vs. “Reviewed DD” almost implies that there is some extreme and expert standard of verification and review that the moderators of this sub engage in. The problem is that no mod with an skill for providing peer review under the moniker of “DD Vet” deserves to be considered by any means an arbiter of truth. No one of us is the arbiter of truth, the one who decides if something is true/worthy or false/bullshit, it is too big a responsibility to pretend one human can handle. In my view the current model we have in this sub for reviewing DD runs counter to the whole point of this GME situation. The strength of GME DD in my opinion has always been the crowd-sourcing approach to research that the community has engaged in, sharing theses and data and thoughts with each other in an ecosystem that allows quality information and research to rise to the top, in the implicit belief that enough sheer collective brainpower directed at discovering the truth of something yields better results than any one individual.

My idea is to make the reviewing of new DD a community process. First and foremost I would like to change the DD flairs to be “Unreviewed DD” instead of “Unverified DD”, and “Community Reviewed DD” instead of just “Reviewed DD”.  My thought was to have something like the top two upvoted “Unreviewed DD” posts every 24h or so would automatically receive a new flair of “Under Community Review”, and the entire community would be encouraged to read and give their own reasonable constructive critiques/observations/additions/suggestions in a collective peer review of the new post, and something like the author being mandated to address in Edits the top 3-5 upvoted constructive and well reasoned pieces of feedback in the comments to get the “Community Reviewed DD” flair.  Instead of just DD Vets undertaking the review process as sole arbiters we could become more like respected opinions that DD writers have a mandate to address the feedback of alongside the best perspectives and feedback of the community as a whole. I feel like we are wasting our subs collective brainpower and ability to produce quality reviewed DD content with the current model, and would love to see a shift that enables us to draw conclusions more as a community. On top of this of course there are only so many mods, and those who there are have many irl distractions that get in the way of giving any one post a full review when there is also the entire sub to maintain. We could also consider having a standardized format for such edits where a DD author acknowledges strengths, weaknesses, further considerations to his piece based on comments.

&#x200B;

On that note,

If any users are interested in being mods with limited permissions for either a more DD-focused role, a more community management focused role, or someone who is good at working with Reddits API, please direct message me or u/Chickthief!

**GME Data Aggregation Project**

Last, Just wanted to let you guys know about an exciting project I’ve been working on with some users in the $GME Discord (of which Chickthief and I are also admins).

We have been working on a GME Data Aggregation Project to share with the sub and improve every user’s access to the standard data and DD source material we are always encountering

A few weeks ago I was having a debate in the $GME discord and was trying to summon some options data from my memory but simply couldn’t. In order to finish my debate/discussion I had to comb through my saved reddit posts to track down the data I was recalling. It occurred to me that it seems preposterous no one has made a repository with all, and I mean all, the data points that are regularly discussed in relation to GME so that anyone can always find source material for their DD or support/countersupport in their discussions.

We have been working on a free dashboard of all this data and aggregating/organizing it for some time. For now we have from November to present: all basic price/volume data, all daily historical options data, basic options math/stats (think daily change in ITM/OTM, etc), FTDs, Reported SI, reported institutional holdings, Short Volume, ON RRP data, and a bunch of data visualization of all of this in ways that illustrates different theses. We are still looking for on-exchange vs. off-exchange/otc/darkpool volume data and a few other points, as well as trying to conceptualize a good approach to visualizing the relevant qualitative data. We will be sharing all of this with the sub as a free online dashboard as soon as it is complete. If any subreddit users would like to help us with this project, have access to some good data, or have cool ideas for what else we can include, send me a dm and I will invite you to the GME discord! I will be working on it as much as I can to share with the community soon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Looking forward to discussing all of this together as a community. Exciting things to come, and I can assure you I will not do anything against the wishes of the community as a whole, this is our space together. Aside from what I’ve included in here, please, if any of you have suggestions on how to improve this sub either comment below or send me or u/Chickthief a dm (and also dm us if any of you would like to help moderate) Love what we’ve built here so far :’), thr0w would be overjoyed.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: ya kinda gotta read it. Cheers y’all <3**

&#x200B;

**PS:** If any of you wonderful people happen to enjoy simple graphic work and wanted to help the sub by working on a new banner/icon more in line with Gamestop's new black and white color scheme, please dm me! I would love you forever and happily bestow any flair of your choosing upon you.

**Edit:** looking forward to replying to all of you and cannot begin to tell you all how much I appreciate the kind words, almost brings a tear to my eye :'). Gonna give more people time to respond before I start answering. In case anyone would like to join I also linked the GME Discord that u/Chickthief and I are admins of on the upper menu bar of the subreddit. It is not quite as large a community, around \~11k, but we have a good amount of rigorously analytical DD focused users on that server and a large active section only tailored to DD and research if any of you enjoy discussing this stuff in real time or want to help out with the GME data aggregation project.
