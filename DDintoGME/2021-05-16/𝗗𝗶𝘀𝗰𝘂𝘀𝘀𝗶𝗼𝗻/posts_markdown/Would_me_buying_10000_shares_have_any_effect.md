What happens if I liquidate all my crypto and other stocks, and buy 10,000 shares (yes, I could go all in if I wanted). Would that even move the price given all the shenanigans in dark pools? Would that even have a chance of starting the MOASS? Or would it have no effect at all?

EDIT!

OMG PEOPLE: I’M DOING IT!!!! WATCHING CRYPTO TANK ALL NIGHT COVINCED ME. THANKS TO THE TANKAGE, I AM ONLY DOING HALF OF WHAT I SAID I WOULD (I LOST A LOT OF MONEY IN 24HRS). IF CRYPTO RECOVERS, AND THE MOASS HASN'T HIT, I’LL PUT IN THE OTHER HALF. I ACTUALLY FEEL GREAT ABLUT THIS DECISION. GOING FOR HIGH SCORE!!!!!!

EDIT 2: Sorry for CAPS. I’m just too excited. If this works, I’m opening Domestic Violence shelters, Homeless Shelters, a technology school for underprivileged, donating to Human Trafficking causes, and starting my own kitten rescue (that one’s for me!). I’m going to repair roads in my city too since no billionaire ever bothered to!

GO GME!
