Degiro broker just withdrew the 10‚Ç¨ from my account, what was agreed upon for voting. 

Can other Degiro apes confirm they getting the same?

Seems Degiro is getting the votes out to out favorite store.

Does this mean a bunch of votes are going to be registered under Degiro customers?

Does this mean my tits r jakd?

Well apes....
