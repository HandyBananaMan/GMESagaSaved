It is not stored in the name of the customer.\n\nTherefore, you can receive the rights of shareholders such as dividends and splits, Voting rights cannot be exercised. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nMe: I think Rakuten Securities can vote on my behalf, is that possible?\n\nR: Unfortunately, we don't do that. We apologize for not meeting your wishes.\n\nMe: What institution is the custodian of my shares?\n\nR: We will prepare the information. Excuse me a moment. Sorry to keep you waiting.\n\nIn the United States, there is a securities depository organization called DTC (Depository Trust Corporation), which is stored under the name of a securities company.\n\nThe shares purchased by our customers are stored under the name of Rakuten Securities in the Interactive Brokers (local agency) name account.\n\nMe: Thank you very much. I would like to ask some questions in English, is it possible? Or is there an English support center?\n\nR: We are sorry, but we do not provide guidance or support in English.",
