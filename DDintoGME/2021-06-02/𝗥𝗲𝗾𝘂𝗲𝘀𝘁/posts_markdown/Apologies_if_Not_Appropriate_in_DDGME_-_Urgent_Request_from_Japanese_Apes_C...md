Rakuten Securities won’t let us apes vote because according to them they use Interactive Brokers as their US custodian and the shares are under Rakuten and not under our names!

THIS IS JUST AN EXCUSE!

Tiger Brokers who use Interactive Brokers as their US custodian under Tiger Brokers name let apes vote because of high demand for voting! IF THEY WORK THE SAME AS RAKUTEN THEN RAKUTEN HAS NO EXCUSE! THEY ARE LAZY AND INCOMPETENT!

Let’s get 楽天証券無能 (Rakuten Securities incompetent) trending on Twitter!!!

Anyone who is Japanese or international, knows Japanese or even just google translate is enough!!! We need to push them to let us VOTE!

Please, this is a cry for help. Most Japanese GME holders don’t know about the DD so there has not been a big movement yet. I’m trying my best to inform people around me but there’s not much I can do alone.

I have so much love and respect for all you Apes!
