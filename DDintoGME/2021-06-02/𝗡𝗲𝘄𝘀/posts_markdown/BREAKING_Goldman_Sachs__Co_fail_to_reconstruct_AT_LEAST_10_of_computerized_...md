So I was doing my morning walkthrough of new FINRA violations and caught this BEAUTY for [Goldman Sachs & Co LLC](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_361.pdf). Anyone else recognize the significances of that date range? It's the SAME timeframe that USS GME was prepping for liftoff.

The data is coming out, apes. Their f\*ckery continues.
