<p>I am not a financial advisor. I am merely a stats loving engineer that is probably on the autistic level of number crunching and pattern recognition. There are my thoughts.</p>
<h1>History Repeating Itself</h1>
<p>Back in the first week of July, I posted this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of6vdw/data_analysis_comparing_march_and_junes_data_to/">data analysis</a> comparing the candlestick measurements directly against each other a one to one day setting. the primary image from that post was this:</p>

<p><img alt="March \/ April vs June \/ July Close Up Overlay 2" src="https://preview.redd.it/00anlfllofg71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9020da61010b6ee141dd6f68a20674fb7b9b72a" /></p>
<p>With the overlay theory we now come to this image:</p>
<p><img alt="Current 1:1 Ratio" src="https://preview.redd.it/fexscv2oofg71.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72bf98336d940602e1c8bf434c694b50a66b7838" /></p>
<p><img alt="Current 1:1 Ratio Close Up" src="https://preview.redd.it/ffbx7qbpofg71.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be7494ba0be39bb8f8b52d4216f27752e6117f4a" /></p>
<h1>A more sophisticated look</h1>
<p>With this initial findings, I eventually wrote up this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogjkao/i_think_i_figured_out_the_shorting_algorithm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">DD</a> detailing the repetition of the shorting algorithm behaviors.</p>
<p><img alt="\~90 Day Cycles" src="https://preview.redd.it/v8xv7xurofg71.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62b62fb5d450b4ec07d5c921f94f5781600f72e6" /></p>
<h1>Necessary definition of shit</h1>
<p>When I use the term algorithm, I mean this: Imagine a black box. Within that black box is a bunch of calculations that is going on. A fuck ton of shit is happening, however, that shit box contents do not matter because it only spits out a single answer. This single answer is the only behavior that matters. This is similar to like a bunch of kids in a giant fucking coat. It doesn't matter how many of those little fuckers are in that coat because to the cartoon adult, it only looks like 1 person.</p>
<h1>Back to the crystal ball</h1>
<p>With this 90 day pattern in mind, many people were doubtful due to how only a few cycles were shown. Thus, to prove the extent of tomfuckery that was occurring, I went ahead and wrote this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owlg3z/the_algorithm_has_been_doing_this_shit_for_years/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">DD</a> to show how this behavior has been going on since at least 2012. This has been so ridiculously overpowering that even the days where the most volume and volatility occurred were even repeating. Those dates are as shown:</p>
<p><img alt="Dates of Most Overnight Change and Volume" src="https://preview.redd.it/s5c7zmytofg71.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c1193d4afe2b9291faf52804ead58e0824b6d35" /></p>
<p><img alt="Net Days Between Dates of Most Overnight Change and Volume" src="https://preview.redd.it/mey15wsvofg71.png?width=363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15b9413a681dfafdf6d851e25e7cd58e4ee40873" /></p>
<p>Here is what those days look like with their associated share price and volume. The red dots present those dates. The closing share price is on the top while the volume of those days are on the bottom</p>

<h1>Let's Combine These Fuckers!</h1>
<p>If we continue to use the greatest overnight as our origin date, we come to the following associated date for 2021:</p>
<p><img alt="Inclusion of 2021 Greatest Overnight Change" src="https://preview.redd.it/bctp61xyofg71.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=265055b16c94a39f3d15ffd094cb9f7eba930f8d" /></p>
<p><img alt="Net Days Between Dates with Greatest Overnight Change with 2021" src="https://preview.redd.it/d07y5r01pfg71.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=776fff2057a6625d99fdcd96b1245e55cdf91943" /></p>
<h1>Because Everyone Loves Dates</h1>
<p>If this sequence is 1:1, the next greatest overnight change will occur on August 19 / 20. From the cyclical dates using previous history, the current dats seem to resemble those from 2019. Thus, it would appear as if the greatest overnight change will occur on August 23 since the August 22 is over the weekend.</p>
<h1>In Conclusion</h1>
<p>Both the 90 days cycle theory and the repeating cycle theory support how the greatest run up will occur around the same time frame of 3rd to 4th week of August.</p>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<p>MOASS has the potential to occur a few days after these dates with the greatest amount of volatility. There is no certainty this will occur since no one can see into the future. Personally, I think some shit is going to go down because the overall daily range of high / low and open / close keeps on getting smaller. We currently are definitely in the initial run ups as we have seen over and over again for almost a decade if not longer. Hold onto you tendies. Keep your hands diamond, your balls titanium, and your buttholes clenched for the next few weeks. I'll see you on the moon, apestronauts.</p>
