    "selftext": "* Today's price action was a desperate attempt to disprove cycles (T+35/T+21) and impact of NSCC-002 rule\n* Shitadel and Co knew as well as anyone the status of DTC/NSCC/OCC rules \u2014 they were prepared\n* It is possible that they pumped other stocks they're long on, like Tesla to avoid talking to marge\n* They probably felt stupid that did not find the connection between RC tweets and price-action cycles, which gave another reason for the Hail Mary attack\n* They hate that apes figured out their secret sauce to counterfeit shares (OTM puts) and hiding FTDs (ITM calls)\n* Because they can't write a good counter DD without being called out, they instead chose to:\n   * Further fuel anticipation of several positive events (ATM, -002, R1000, T21/35) to set higher expectations\n   * Avoided easily identifiable shorting techniques like ETF and instead stuck to OTM puts (also because of Monday indices rebalance)\n* So, they tried to do what they typically do \u2014 pump and dump \u2014 but only this time they tried to pump expectations and dump hopes \u2026 and follow-up with news like these\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fb3plt7qob771.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=f197c876a30ad8e1edc702f56f44426ff95a81f5\n\n* But in the process of proving their point, they gave apes tasty tasty discount which is evident by Fidelity orders\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lavnca1tob771.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b75171f679d48870ef3f7be64ef29db29492bc75\n\nThis is a waiting game. We're dealing with the most crooked and arrogant characters of a high flying club. We wait and wait and wait till they bleed \u2014 not a financial advice.",
