<h1>Title: Today's price action was Shitadel &amp; Co's counter DD. It's a desperate move that only further confirms they're trying to rig the game and manufacture stories to get out of a deep dung hole.</h1>

<li>Today's price action was a desperate attempt to disprove cycles (T+35/T+21) and impact of NSCC-002 rule</li>
<li>Shitadel and Co knew as well as anyone the status of DTC/NSCC/OCC rules — they were prepared</li>
<li>It is possible that they pumped other stocks they're long on, like Tesla to avoid talking to marge</li>
<li>They probably felt stupid that did not find the connection between RC tweets and price-action cycles, which gave another reason for the Hail Mary attack</li>
<li>They hate that apes figured out their secret sauce to counterfeit shares (OTM puts) and hiding FTDs (ITM calls)</li>
<li>Because they can't write a good counter DD without being called out, they instead chose to:</li>
<li>Further fuel anticipation of several positive events (ATM, -002, R1000, T21/35) to set higher expectations</li>
<li>Avoided easily identifiable shorting techniques like ETF and instead stuck to OTM puts (also because of Monday indices rebalance)</li>
<li>So, they tried to do what they typically do — pump and dump — but only this time they tried to pump expectations and dump hopes … and follow-up with news like these</li>

<ul>
<li>But in the process of proving their point, they gave apes tasty tasty discount which is evident by Fidelity orders</li>

<p>This is a waiting game. We're dealing with the most crooked and arrogant characters of a high flying club. We wait and wait and wait till they bleed — not a financial advice.</p>
