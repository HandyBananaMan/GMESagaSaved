Heya apes.  

I'd post this in superstonk, but I've perfected the lurk.  

On may 30th i started logging the active users count as reported by the api.  I'm literally a physical laborer  so forgive my dumb ape pictures and use of Google sheets.

If you look at the last time we had a big selloff (June 10th) we see a massive spike in user count before it starts.  This spike continues until like the 11th before it returns to the normalish range.  I don't know what it means, but I thought it was an interesting piece of info to know we had almost a 4x increase in active users BEFORE the selloff.  

The part that is truly anomalous in my opinion are the random drops in count that happen at odd times.  For instance, June 10th, right after midnight, we have 120k active users.  For three hours, they all go to sleep, leaving us with 35k online.  Then at fucking 4am we see 176k users online?  What in all that is holy is going on?  

This probably isn't useful, but it's what I have to contribute.
