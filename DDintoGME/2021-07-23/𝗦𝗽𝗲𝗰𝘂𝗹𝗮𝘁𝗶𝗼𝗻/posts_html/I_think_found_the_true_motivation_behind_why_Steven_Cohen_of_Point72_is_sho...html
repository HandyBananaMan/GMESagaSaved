<p>TL;DR: Steven Cohen has been working on deals to acquire Wata Games, a company that specializes in appraisal and trading of video games and collectables. This deal went through on the heavily hyped day of 7 /14. Steven Cohen's motivation to short GameStop was not because he thought it was a dying brick-and-mortar store, but because he wanted to hurt or kill his competition in the video game trading and collecting sector for easier entry.Â Follow up post: https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/oqpiha/a_dd_on_how_shf_are_manipulating_the_art_world_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</p>
<p>For those who didn't see the post yesterday, I've been researching the manipulative practices that Steven Cohen and Kenneth Griffin have been using against the art market. While I admit I got a little drunk while writing that post, and got side tracked down a rabbit hole of conspiracy level connections to Russian oligarchs and Hollywood executives, instead of more concrete evidence of art manipulation, I think that mistake paid off in a big way.</p>
<p>While trying to walk myself back to where I was before the side rail, I discovered that Steven Cohen, through a series of companies, bought Wata Games.</p>
<p>"Wata Games, the company that graded the recent record-breaking copies of The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64, has been acquired by Collectors Universe, which grades coins, trading cards, and other collectibles and memorabilia. The purchase signals video gamesâ€™ growing prominence in the world of collectibles, which has seen significant interest recently due to the skyrocketing value of things like PokÃ©mon cards."Â </p>

<p>"Collector's Universe provides third-party authentication and grading services to collectors, retail buyers and sellers of collectibles. It's authentication services focus on coins, trading cards, sports memorabilia, and autographs. In December 2020, an investment group led by collector Nat Turner, D1 Partners and Cohen Private Ventures offered $700 million to acquire the Collector's Universe. Ultimately, the deal was increased to $92/share equating to an $853 million acquisition price."</p>

<p>"Cohen Private Ventures invests long-term capital, primarily in direct private investments and other opportunistic transactions, on behalf of Steven A. Cohen."</p>

<p>I wanted to post this as soon as possible, but it fits the theory I was already making for Part 3 of DD on the art market manipulation.Â </p>
<p>The running theory for Part 3 is that Steven Cohen is trying to purchase auction houses and a mass amount of different subjectively priced commodities, like art, baseball cards, and other collectable items, so that he can sell one item at a record breaking price to bump the price of all other related items, and then also profit through the sell of those items through his auction houses. I will hopefully have a much more detailed DD later today or this weekend. But in the mean time I hope this ties everyone over.Â </p>
<p>Edit: Holy fucking shit the amount of messages and chats I am getting in my inboxes accusing me of being a part of Q-Anon and that I need to seek mental health makes me actually think I'm on to something.</p>
<p>For the record, as far as I'm concerned: fuck Q-Anon, fuck Republicans, fuck Democrats, I'm not apart of any affiliations or groups, I'm completely mentally stable and have no thoughts of suicide, and I just fucking like this stock. âœŠðŸ’ŽðŸš€</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm slowly trying to keep track of all the comments coming in, but am also working on my DD. I have seen comments saying that Wata is a retro appraisal company and does not sell used games. That is true, but it is still very relevant to GME and the market they are in. I'll explain in further detail why it's connected, but in the mean time would just like to point you to this 10 month old Nintendo thread and see if you can figure it out yourself instead. https://www.nintendolife.com/forums/retro/value_on_complete_boxed_nes_console</p>
