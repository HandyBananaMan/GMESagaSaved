<p><strong>User</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/St_Savoir_Faire/"><strong>u/St_Savoir_Faire</strong></a> <strong>seems to have found a workaround using this link:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/search?q=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9D%90%91%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AF%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%B0%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%9D%20%F0%9D%90%83%F0%9D%90%83%20%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%22">https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/search?q=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9D%90%91%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AF%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%B0%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%9D%20%F0%9D%90%83%F0%9D%90%83%20%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%22</a></p>
<p>It says: <strong><em>Sorry, there were no community results for “ flair_name:"𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐃 ✔️" ”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>But it shows the results at the same time!</strong></p>
<p>I tried this in other subs, but looks like it only works here (I have no idea why). 🤔</p>
<p>------------------------------------</p>
<p>First time I noticed this was in [r]SuperStonk, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8y11s/the_dd_section_has_disappeared_from_the_filters/">almost a month ago</a>... I was downvoted to oblivion, and ignored by the mods, despite the importance of this fact.</p>
<p>Now it is also happening in [r]GME, [r]GMEJungle... and <strong>here.</strong></p>
<p>New posts with the flair can be seen in the feeds, of course, but to filter by those flairs (and therefore to find or dive for such content) seems impossible.</p>
<p>Some time ago, it still worked in old.reddit, but now (at least for me) is not working even there.</p>
<p>Am I the only one suffering from this situation?</p>
<p>Isn't this a direct way to hide and make the most important content unreachable?</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
