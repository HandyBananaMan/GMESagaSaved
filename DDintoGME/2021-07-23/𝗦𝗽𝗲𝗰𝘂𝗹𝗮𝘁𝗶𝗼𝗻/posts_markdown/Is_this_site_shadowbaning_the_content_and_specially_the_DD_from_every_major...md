# EDIT:

**User** [**u/St\_Savoir\_Faire**](https://www.reddit.com/user/St_Savoir_Faire/) **seems to have found a workaround using this link:**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/search?q=flair\_name%3A%22%F0%9D%90%91%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AF%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%B0%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%9D%20%F0%9D%90%83%F0%9D%90%83%20%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%22](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/search?q=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9D%90%91%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AF%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%B0%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%9D%20%F0%9D%90%83%F0%9D%90%83%20%E2%9C%94%EF%B8%8F%22)

It says: ***Sorry, there were no community results for “ flair\_name:"𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐃 ✔️" ”***

**But it shows the results at the same time!**

I tried this in other subs, but looks like it only works here (I have no idea why). 🤔

\------------------------------------

First time I noticed this was in \[r\]SuperStonk, [almost a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8y11s/the_dd_section_has_disappeared_from_the_filters/)... I was downvoted to oblivion, and ignored by the mods, despite the importance of this fact.

Now it is also happening in \[r\]GME, \[r\]GMEJungle... and **here.**

New posts with the flair can be seen in the feeds, of course, but to filter by those flairs (and therefore to find or dive for such content) seems impossible.

Some time ago, it still worked in old.reddit, but now (at least for me) is not working even there.

Am I the only one suffering from this situation?

Isn't this a direct way to hide and make the most important content unreachable?
