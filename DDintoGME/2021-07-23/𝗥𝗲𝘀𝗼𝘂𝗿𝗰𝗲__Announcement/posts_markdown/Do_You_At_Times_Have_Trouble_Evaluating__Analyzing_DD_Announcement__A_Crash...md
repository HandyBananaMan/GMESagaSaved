# Announcement Portion

Hi all! As I’m sure many have noticed, we have had a surge of new subscribers as a consequence of recent drama on other subs. Let me begin this post by saying welcome to all new users! I understand many are used to the culture of other GME subs, which in the chaos of recent days has understandably lead to some methods of expression and behavior making their way here.



Examples of this involve baselessly accusing people of being shills, attempting ad hominem attacks in comments that respond to unpopular ideas, directing the topic of conversation to prohibited topics that do not directly relate to the research and discussion of GME stock, a lot of use of uncivil and disrespectful language towards commenters one is in disagreement with, directing the conversation towards the conspiratorial when challenged, and comments of cookie-cutter meme language statements purely for their own sake (ie, untethered to any reasoned contribution to the discussion at hand).

For the record, feel free to use these meme language statements to emphasize a point in a productive contribution to the focus of this sub to render it more entertaining, just please do not add comments that effectively only contribute noise. This is the one sub that attempts to keep a focus towards research and discussion in a logical manner, and the moderation team intends to keep it that way.We are planning to improve and specify our content guidelines in the upcoming weeks as well as beef up our automod, however, if users would kindly familiarize themselves with the sub’s content guidelines featured on the side of the sub as part of the wiki, they would learn they are already in fact quite extensive in the interest of keeping this sub’s intended focus.



Regarding the above, I would like to make a few points as to the atmosphere and culture of this sub that the mod team seeks to promote and strive towards.

\-	Every commenter, within the extent of what is permitted by the content guidelines, is allowed to assert/posit any thesis or claim (I would add that they should also bring support for said thesis and claim if they intend to posit it, a claim without support can be tossed aside with 0 consideration imo though, so I hope this is obvious)

o	This means they can posit something bearish; they can posit something bullish; they can posit whatever does not violate the content guidelines.

o	This is to keep the sub exposed to as broad a set of perspectives as possible – and this post will illustrate why the mod team believes this is a net positive



\-	There is absolutely no reason to inherently fear a claim or thesis that makes you uncomfortable or clashes with your confirmation bias. Our cognitive biases plague us all, none of us are immune, and our brain has a certain extent of fight or flight response to uncomfortable ideas it doesn’t want to acknowledge. The good news is that no matter how uncomfortable the claim is to consider, if it is poorly constructed it will fall apart under minimal logical scrutiny. I have written this post in the interest of helping the community, especially the less familiar with logical systems, to have a basic toolkit for DD analysis – the focus of this sub.



\-	& Ultimately, if the uncomfortable claim, thesis, or theory is well constructed and you can’t find anything logically at issue with it, yes, it sucks to have to question whatever clashing view you may have held in response to such an experience, and imo thank goodness you got to read it, if such a thing happens. *If there is literally no logical issue* with anything in an uncomfortable argument/thesis, *then that is a good argument/thesis*.



\-	The rest of this post is me explaining the basics of logic and how they can be used to critically evaluate any claim, thesis, or argument. As we transition the sub towards our intended Community Review model for DD vetting, I hope that this will be useful for helping less familiar users participate in this process, as well as render the activity of well reasoned DD discussion and analysis something slightly more accessible.

# A Crash-Course on Using Basic Formal Logic for Critical Analysis

Now let's talk about Logic. A good understanding of Logic and the topic you’re applying it to is like a superpower: it teaches you to discern the difference between what's plausible/true and what's implausible/bullshit.

The beauty of logic is that, if you demonstrate with it that someone's conclusion does not follow from their premises, their argument has effectively crumbled in an absolute sense. They can bitch and moan, they can cuss and fight, but they know it when it happens, and you know it when it happens. At that point whatever they respond, unless it fixes the logical flaw, can be answered with “Lol”, they have lost the debate and theres nothing they can do to change it unless they want to engage in terms of logic.


For the rest of this post I’m going to ask you to almost entirely forget about the specific variables involved in GME and the stock market –- I will use them to illustrate particular logical structures, and occasionally diverge to give examples of using logic in fully GME-related everyday discussion -- but the logical systems can be applied to any field, and in fact many fields are built entirely upon them, including Empiricism/Science.  Logical systems tend to be absolute, as their purpose is to select for the condition of Truth -- which is binary with Falsehood.


Logic is one of (if not the) oldest and most fundamental analytical systems in existence, a field contributed to by many of the smartest people in History.  Without going into the meta-discussion of whether the field of Logic’s claims about itself are in themselves sound, let's talk about what these claims are. 

The field of Logic holds that it *is* the set of rules that select for Truth, and the requisite structure for correct thinking (in relation to directing analytical thought from what is known to be true towards what is true, and ideally, what was previously unknown to be true). What this means in practice is that logic is **the** system by which one discerns *anything* to be true or false, whether they know it or not. 

Logic may seem like a foreign and not-user-friendly system at first glance, especially once I start to use it more symbolically below. Logic, however, is in  actuality a symbolic version of what your brain already has done every time it has thought correctly to reach a true conclusion. Conversely, shit logic is what your brain has done every time it reached a false conclusion. Logic is something all of our brains naturally utilize innumerable times every day. A basic awareness of the symbolic form, whether you ever use it or not, can give you immense familiarity with the way that correct reasoning does and doesn't work, and to begin to notice when reasoning is correct vs. goes astray in one's own mind. This is likewise applicable to any supported claim anyone ever makes to you in speech or writing


Over the ages there have been a lot of derivations of the system, many alternate and more complex logical forms developed by different geniuses, the first of which has been plausibly argued to go back to Ancient Greece and their golden age of Philosophy. Enough history though, this is about basics, let's get in to how Logic works.

---------

I’m going to start with argument structure. In Logic, arguments are any claim anyone asserts with support, and they all follow a single basic structure. This is as follows:

---------

**Premise 1, Premise 2**…(Premise x) , **Therefore**: **Conclusion 1**, … (Conclusion x \[although don’t worry about multiple statement conclusions yet lmao\]).

---------

Let's apply what this would look like in a GME context (I will demonstrate how to do this using symbolic logic further down – for now the spoken word/verbalized forms of the relevant logical rules/structures are bolded and capitalized).

---------

Premise 1 (**P1**): **IF** hedgies naked shorted GME over 100% of shares outstanding, **THEN** hedgies r fuk


Premise 2 (**P2**): Hedgies naked shorted GME over 100% of shares outstanding


Therefore (**∴**):

Conclusion 1 (**C1**): Hedgies r fuk

---------

Let’s contextualize this further. Anything anyone (and I mean *anyone*, be they the most popular author ever or the least known one) ever asserts that is not a damn near certainty in any DD post, speculative post, thesis, or claim, can be fit into this basic argument structure. If it is a claim without premises, this means a claim with no support, thus P1 & P2 are empty and therefore the conclusion is not logically justified. In my opinion, these can always be safely thrown out as baseless.

---------

**Fun(ish) example**: if I tell you your post violates content policy and is therefore being removed, and you respond "shill!!" with nothing else, then I throw this out as a baseless claim. At least *try* to find some supporting premises lmao.

---------

Also, in case anyone was wondering, the reason you need at minimum 2 premises and at minimum only 1 conclusion is because if you only had 1 premise, the conclusion could only be a re-statement of that premise. Arguments draw connections between premises using logic in order to posit a claim or thesis (conclusion).


Now let’s discuss the related concepts of logical **validity**, logical **soundness**, and the related avenues one can take in challenging a claim. Let’s recall our basic argument structure as it is also relevant:

**P1, P2, Therefore: C1**


The reason that our argument structure is relevant (aside from being the basic form that every supported claim ever made takes), is that there are two principal avenues by which to logically critique an argument:

---------

1. **To demonstrate an issue in the logic of the argument** – ie, the means by which the argument links the premises to draw the conclusion (this relates to **validity**)

2. **To demonstrate an issue with the premises of an argument** – ie, if a premise used to draw a logically valid conclusion is demonstrably false, the conclusion does not follow because one of its supporting premises is falsehood (this relates to **soundness**)

---------

**Validity** is not what many may think. In common parlance a statement is often called “valid” when one thinks it is true or makes a good point. In formal logic this is not entirely wrong, but it misses some key technical qualifiers involved in determining validity. Logic is essentially word math; operating terms used all have a technical function in the process of logical analysis and critical thinking, which in turn mean utilizing logic to determine if something is true, maybe true/maybe false, or false.

Validity may hurt ya brain ever so slightly at first, but there's an easy trick I'm gonna show you right below to quickly determine whether a claim/argument is valid or invalid.

---------

**Validity**: when the truth of an argument’s premises necessitate the truth of the arguments conclusion;

**Or, in alternate terms:**

An argument is valid **if, and only if**, it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion to nevertheless be false.

---------

An argument is valid if the premises being true make the conclusion indisputable, inarguable, logically correct – whether or not the premises are *actually* true. Validity is a measure of the correct (or incorrect) application of Logic within an argument under the hypothetical assumption that all the premises are true – \[questioning whether the premises (supporting points) are themselves true is where we move on to logical soundness\]. The definition of logical soundness involves validity as a pre-condition to conclude soundness, so please be patient lol, we are almost through validity.

The reason the premises are assumed true to test for validity, is that the potential for supporting premises to be false is the other possible death sentence for an argument/claim. Validity just seeks to measure that the system of formal Logic has been used correctly to draw a conclusion from those premises, completely separate from whether those premises are themselves true.

Now that that is hopefully more or less clear, here is the productive, operating tool that one can use to assess validity (keep in mind this is a shortcut, but this post is concerned with basics):

---------

**The simple test for validity is this:**

**Step 1**: take any claim, and set up the support and conclusion in basic form of premises123, therefore: conclusion1,

**Step 2**: ask the two following questions as you follow this decision tree.

\-	A. is it possible for all the premises to be true at the same time?

o	Yes? Go to Q2

o	No? Valid (don’t ask, it's just how it works)

\-	B. in the conceivable world where all those premises are true at the same time, is it possible for the conclusion to still be false?

o	Yes? Invalid

o	No? Valid

---------


Done, that’s the shortcut way to test for validity. If you are reading comments on a piece of DD and just discovered an argument is invalid, boom, done. Gently assert as much to whoever made the invalid statement and their argument/claim has fallen apart, there is no substance to it if the logic is not valid, no need to insult or threaten or call shill. More complex theses can require more advanced validity tests, but this post is concerned with explaining the basics, as gaining an understanding of those can already help organize one’s ideas to shocking extents, as well as one’s ability to break down what they take issue with in another's post.


---------

**Soundness** is the next logical evaluation one makes in analyzing a particular thesis, argument, or claim. Soundness requires validity as a precondition, like so:

**Soundness** = *Valid + True Premises*

**Or in alternate terms**, 

An argument is sound **If, and only if,** it is *both valid* **and** contains *only true premises* (underlying support).

---------

Evaluating the truth of premises is where we branch into the next avenue for logical and well-reasoned critique of any given thesis. In simple terms, is the support someone is applying their (hopefully) good logic to, in fact definitely true? Do the sources the author asserting such is using, and the data they contain, fully justify the authors syntax in describing their support & conclusion?

You see with Logic, its **turtles all the way down** (please don’t ask me about the bottom, that’s the gate to Epistemology and it’s a head-fuck and a half, not worth going there relating to GME unless we all fancy an unpleasant aftermath of asking ourselves “do we *really* know *anything* at all?”).

There are several important historical theorists who conceptualize all knowledge to be predicated upon the possession of prior knowledge, in a form much akin to p1,p2, therefore c1. Think of humanity developing cooking for instance. Leading to this discovery, an oversimplified p1 could be conceived as ‘we have the ability to generate controlled fire’, p2 could be conceived as ‘when food is put near the fire for some time before eating, it tastes better and becomes easier to digest’, therefore, someone at some point perhaps concluded, ‘we should almost always put our food near this fire before eating so it tastes better and is easier to digest.”

When you look at a piece of DD, speculation, or quite literally anything that asserts a claim, everything it uses as a source + the way the author synthesizes the informational value of that source, is itself generated from a set of premises and conclusions, same as everything else. You can apply a degree of basic formal logic analysis to every one of the author’s premises as well to evaluate, to the best of your ability, whether they are also true.

---------

**Example in regular talk:**

**I will give a hopefully relatable example of a well known bearish thesis and how I could challenge the truth of its premises to toss it aside without second thought. As we all know, the original GME bear thesis was built upon a premise of GME likely one day being crushed under its longterm debt. GME no longer has any longterm debt, and that premise and the bearish thesis it attempts to justify positing can eat a dick, it is demonstrably false.**

---------

This is where I will briefly touch on assumptions. These are like hidden premises that the premises of an argument are founded/built upon. My above description touches upon the sort of “turtles all the way down” nature of Logic. The founding logical premises that any given author is putting forth are themselves built upon unquantifiable numbers of assumptions. For example, one important assumption of everything I am saying, is that logic can in fact be used to accurately and precisely select for the Truth or Falsehood of a claim. My only point is if it seems like a DD author or commenter doesn’t actually state their support accurately, or their support itself seems built on even more dubious support, you can apply the same process of logical analysis all the way up and down.

Another assumption is one I possess when I write a post like this, I assume there is some demand or enjoyment of having access to this sort of guide (or rather hope lmao). In this post I will not focus on assumptions, however, as they are a bit trickier.

---------

**Example in regular talk:**

**Another bearish thesis we are all familiar with is "Waaahhhh :'(, why you still buy and hold for MOASS (implicit thesis: that makes no sense to this speaker), when reported SI shows that the shorts have been covered (support)". One can easily challenge this particular argument by explaining how SI can demonstrably be proven to be a metric of dubious truth/accuracy due to its self reported nature and minimal legal deterrents for misreporting, thus the conclusion is premised on unsound grounding, and can be cast aside. Getfukt.**

---------


**Here's imo a good rule of thumb:**

**We needn’t fear a claim we dislike reading, that clashes forcefully with one of our strongly held beliefs or opinions. Why? If it’s a shit claim, and you do basic logical analysis like this post explains, you'll quickly be able to determine one of the following to be the case**: **a**) that’s bullshit, **b**) this person is positing far more than they have justification to assert, or **c**) hmmm, oh shit this person might be right, better re-evaluate my understanding of this situation.


It’s win-fucking-win to learn to think this way with regard to GME, and if as a community we were to familiarize ourselves with the nature of Logic, we could vastly increase our overall capabilities to participate in the collective community reviewing of DD (as the future subreddit model is intended to be).


Let's take it further. Why needn't we fear an attempted bearish claim relating to GME? Well, while it is fallacious to assume past events predict future outcomes, this thesis has been well known for 6 months, and in that time no one attempting to discredit or disprove it logically has even slightly succeeded from my view. That is not insignificant imo. Let's not pretend its some small thesis either, as you will see below, larger claims carry a larger burden of proof/justification and are typically far easier to logically challenge and discredit.

---------

# Ok, now time for some specific logical rules and what can and can’t be inferred about them:

Let’s learn about our placeholder symbols: each premise/phrase/sentence involving one consolidated claim is shortened to be a capital letter. **Eg:** A, B, C … X,Y,Z. They are just placeholder symbols to represent written statements, to which you can add lower case and super/sub-script letters and numbers to qualify further.


---------

**For example: (will use these statements + symbols to illustrate logical rules below)**

\-	**‘GME will soar to the moon, the damn $ value equivalent of a foreign phone number’** will be represented as **[G]**

**-	‘GME *was* shorted over 100% of shares outstanding’** will be represented as **[Ws]** (Was short)

**-	‘GME *is* shorted over 100% of shares outstanding’ will be represented as **[Is]** (Is short)

**-	‘Shorts must cover at some point in time’** will be represented as **[M]**

**-	‘Shorts did cover’** will be represented as **[C]**

**-	‘Shorts have the ability to cover’** will be represented as **[H]**

**-	'Covering is the only way to reduce the short interest from over 100%'** will be represented as **[O]**

**-	‘Every single ape does nothing but buy and hold’** will be represented as **[A]**

**-	‘Shorts r still fuk’** can be represented as **[F]**

**-	**'Shorts did reduce their SI below 100%'** will be represented as **[R]**

---------

**Ok that should be enough. Let’s look at logical operative terms and their corresponding technical meanings.**

---------


**First**, we have **negation**, or the word “**Not**” – represented by the symbol [~] in front of any premise, or set of premises, that is being negated.


**EXAMPLE**: “shorts did **NOT** cover” could be transcribed in logical symbolic form as [~C]

\-	Note: once you have multiple statements strung together in multiple sets of brackets, you can also negate the entirety of sets of statements. This works almost exactly the way multiplying a bracket by a negative works in Math.

Another thing to know is that a double-negation equals a positive (in case you ever wondered where that grammar rule came from). **~(~C) = C**

A positive premise/conclusion (or set of these) that is negated becomes negative. A negative premise/conclusion (or set of these) that is negated becomes positive.

Extra note: in completely regular speech, what a negation does is add the words "it is NOT the case that:" in front of what ever claim the negation symbol is placed before.

---------


**Second** we have **conjunction**, or the word “**And**” – and it it represented by the symbol [∧]


**EXAMPLE**:“Shorts must cover at some point in time AND every single ape does nothing but buy and hold” – could be transcribed in symbolic logical form as [M∧A]

\-	Note: you can string as many statements together as you like with the use of [∧], however, it is important to separate each new term with another set of brackets.

o	“GME is shorted over 100% of shares outstanding, AND Shorts must cover at some point in time, AND every single ape does nothing but buy and hold” could be represented as: [ **Is∧(M∧A)** ]


One thing to know about ‘**AND**’ is that you can pull terms connected by them apart at the end of a conditional (if..then) statement (after the arrow), but not when they represent the condition of the conditional statement (the part before the arrow)

---------


**Third** we have the word “**Or**” – and it is represented by the symbol [∨]

**EXAMPLE**: “shorts did NOT cover OR shorts did cover” can be represented as [ ~C ∨ C ]


The ‘or’ seems simple but by definition it excludes certain statements from being possibly true, creating a logical structure for a claim that asserts only 1 of 2+ outcomes linked by \[∨\]s is possible. It is a key operator to many deductive arguments.

One thing to know about ‘or is that you can pull terms connected by them apart at the beginning of a conditional if then statement (before the arrow), but not when they represent the result of the conditional statement (the part after the arrow)

Further, 'or' can be utilized in complex, multi-variable forms to structure extremely complex logical statements that select by process of elimination for the truth. Think about it, a sequence of 'or's connecting many variables ultimately means that only one, or one one set, of those variables can be true according to the corresponding 'or' statement.

I will give a brief illustration of the logical and deductive power of an or statement when paired with negations. Every single time you read a theory in a DD or speculation post, there are ultimately one of two possibilities, either the theory is right, or it is NOT right. I will represent 'popular author's DD is true' as [P]. Both before and after I read 'popular author's DD', I know for a fact that either P is true or it is false, these are binary conditions. (P ∨ ~P) = popular author's DD is either true OR NOT true. The 'or' has a useful power to exclude falsehood by making premises/conclusions compete with one another for which is true.

"But Mr. Logic Man!" you say, "I get that the DD thesis can ultimately only be true or not true, but come on there's some good parts of it, he definitely got the first part right!" 

Fair point, but you see, as I said Logic is **turtles all the way down.**

First off, from a logical perspective, **if** some of the sub-arguments--that are in effect premises of a grander argument thesis by a DD author -- **are false**,  **then** overall, the grander argument thesis **does not follow from the premises.** 

You are right however, it may be possible to salvage some of the claims, let's say like above you like the first part, call it "Claim 1" and let [C1] represent "Claim 1 of DD author's thesis is true". 

See? Same thing.

Now you have to determine the same thing but for *this* claim: **( C1 ∨ ~C1)** -- "either Claim 1 of DD author's thesis is true OR Claim 1 of DD author's thesis is NOT true." 'Or' statements can be applied to every single critical evaluation you ever do.

---------


**Fourth** we have something a bit more exciting, the conditional “**IF…THEN”** statement. This one is foundational to an enormous portion of all logic you will ever encounter.


**This is represented by an arrow, [→]** , with everything before the arrow being what follows "IF” and everything after the arrow being what follows “THEN”


EXAMPLE: “**IF** shorts did NOT cover, THEN shorts r still fuk” can be represented as [ ~C → F ]

---------

Now, 'If…then' statements allow a certain level of implicit deduction of a new logical truth, the **contrapositive**. To find the contrapositive of any if...then statement, take the part after the arrow and switch it with the part before the arrow and vice-versa, then negate both terms. This is a deductive truth of any true if...then statement. 
- ( A → B ; contrapositive: ~B → ~A, automatically true if original if...then statement is true)

---------

**Here is a little related fallacy**: if it ends up being true that “Shorts r still fuk”[F], that in no way proves that “shorts did not cover”[~C]

However, from the above 'If…then' statement, we can infer (if it is true) that “**IF** Shorts r **NOT** still fuk\[ ~F ] **THEN** shorts did cover” [ ~F → C ]. This is the **contrapositive**.

---------

Note: this is not a demonstration of necessarily true premises by any means, they are obv memey phrases to demonstrate how the formal structure of logic works. If I personally were met with the above, I would deny the necessary truth of the first 'if…then' statement and thus its contrapositive based on analyzing its underlying assumption premises to disprove it logically. From a conversational POV, the above statements are too reductive for as complex a system as the stock market, do we know for an absolute true fact that those are the only variables involved in the equation of shorts being fuk or not? Logically speaking, no. However, *if* (see how this stuff finds itself into every one of your critical thoughts?\] the original statement were true, *then* so would be its contrapositive.


I think I’ll visit more complex logical rules and operators in a later post if there is interest in and appreciation for this one. The above outlines the building blocks of almost everything you need to start breaking down any claim/thesis/assertion made on this sub using critical thinking and logic.


I know it may appear dense and boring, but the above is the basics of what is required to think correctly using reason from a set of true facts to a plausible/likely/true conclusion. Further, it is likewise the basic structure that you need to analyze in others claims to determine if those claims are true/false/unknowable based on the premises


Let's look at how a complex argument structure might look using our above symbols and their associated sentences. I tried to make this demonstration a bit more fun to give a rest from how dense and formal that Logic can seem. Lets take a look: I have listed the above converted-to-symbol statements again below and constructed an example of how to string together a logical argument.


If you were to be evaluating the below argument from some random poster, you would have the opportunity to challenge my argument from two principal angles. First off, do I use logic correctly, in moving from premises to conclusions and further premises and conclusions? Second, are my premises true?  For reference, in the simplistic form that the below argument is made, I could easily make a case the conclusions do not fully follow from the premises as the premises are oversimplified and reductive of the situation they describe in reality.


---------

# Here we go:

Ignore that some of these basic phrases seem bearish, it is often easier to use the positive form of a logical statement when setting these up, even if you wish to assert the negation of the phrase, *ie* to assert Shorts did **NOT** cover (\**~C**), the better way to assign the symbol is (C) representing the meaning “shorts did cover” for the sake of keeping your mind organized.

---------

\-	**‘GME will soar to the moon, the damn damn $ value equivalent of a foreign phone number’** will be represented as **[ G ]**

**-	‘GME was shorted over 100% of shares outstanding’** will be represented as **[ Ws ]** (was short)

**-	‘GME is shorted over 100% of shares outstanding’** will be represented as **[ Is ]** (Is short)

**-	‘Shorts must cover at some point in time’** will be represented as **[ M ]**

**-	‘Shorts did cover’** will be represented as **[ C ]**

**-	‘Shorts have the ability to cover’** will be represented as **[ H ]**

**-	'Covering is the only way to reduce the short interest from over 100%'** will be represented as **[ O ]**

**-	‘Every single ape does nothing but buy and hold’** will be represented as **[ A ]**

**-	‘Shorts r still fuk’** can be represented as **[ F ]**

**-	'Shorts did reduce their SI below 100%'** will be represented as **[ R ]**

---------


Here is an example constructed logical argument with these phrases. For you actual logicians *if* this goes to shit cos I wrote ineffective meme phrasing to make my point, *then* please forgive me lmao.


---------

**P1: F v ~F** -- ('Either shorts r fuk, OR, shorts r NOT fuk')


**P2: Ws** -- (‘GME was shorted over 100% of shares outstanding’)


**P3: O** -- (‘covering is the only way to reduce the short interest from over 100%’)


**P4: Ws ∧ O** -- ('GME was shorted over 100% of shares outstanding AND covering is the only way to reduce the short interest from over 100%’)


**P5: (Ws ∧ O) ∧ ~R** -- ('GME was shorted over 100% of shares outstanding, AND covering is the only way to reduce the short interest from over 100%, AND shorts did NOT reduce their SI below 100%')


**P6: [(Ws ∧ O) ∧ ~R] → (~C ∧ Is)** ('IF [GME was shorted over 100% of shares outstanding, AND covering is the only way to reduce the short interest from over 100%, AND shorts did NOT reduce their SI below 100%]; THEN (shorts did NOT cover, AND Gme is shorted over 100% of shares outstanding)')


---------

∴
**C1**: **~C ∧ Is** (**Therefore:** shorts did NOT cover, AND Gme is shorted over 100% of shares outstanding)

---------

**P7: ([~C ∧ Is] ∧ A) → F** (IF (shorts did NOT cover, AND Gme is shorted over 100% of shares outstanding, AND every single ape does nothing but buy and hold), THEN shorts r still fuk)


**P8**: **A** (Every single ape does nothing but buy and hold)

---------

∴
**C2 (follows from C1, P7&8): F** (**Therefore:** shorts r still fuk)

**C2 (extra proof)[follows from P2-8; and P1, which was ( F ∨ ~F): ~~F = F**. 
-- [Shorts r NOT fuk has been logically eliminated from the original 'or' statement of P1]

---------


**P9: (F → G)** (IF shorts r still fuk, THEN GME will will soar to the moon, the damn $ value equivalent of a foreign phone number)

---------

∴
**C3 (follows from C2 & P9): G** (**Therefore:** GME will soar to the moon, the damn $ value equivalent of a foreign phone number)

---------


The 'or' statement placed at the start of this argument was mostly to illustrate how a central question with a yes or no answer often dominates these theses. In this case I made it 'Either shorts r fuk OR shorts r NOT fuk'. The reason I do a proof of C2 being right is to show that the logic up to that point also validates the current reached conclusion of 'F' using the previous logic and the P1 'or' statement. The last step would also logically prove that the other possibility of the argument's truth (~G) is not the case (~~G) = (G)

Does it make sense how this structure can generalize to most arguments and claims? The process of evaluating every. Single. Piece. Of. DD. And. Research. Boils down to delving into the logic that connects the premises to the conclusion and whether the premises that support the argument are themselves true or false.

If you learn to think like this naturally, and familiarize yourselves with the subject, you needn’t fear any one else’s theses. You will know if they are shit or good. You will have the tools. I hope this was a bit helpful to some of you.

# Last Part: Razors

Razors are a fun little part of Logic/Philosophy. Occams is the most famous, and there are many others. They are little rules you can use on a macro level to select what explanation for a bunch of data/premises is most likely to be plausible/true. My advice is do not use razors as the central piece of reasoning in any of your critiques, they are more like useful logical guideline tools.

---------

**Occams razor** is the principle of simplicity/parsimony: the more factors and convoluted, complex details a theoretical explanation/thesis involves, the less likely it is to be the correct/true explanation. Likewise, the theoretical explanation/thesis that is capable of explaining a set of data in the simplest way with fewest factors and convoluted details is the most likely to be correct/true.

Why is this held? Because think about it, if you make a theory that involves 10 different sets of premises and conclusions to assert its overall conclusion, then evaluating the logic of the theory requires delving into each little set of premises and conclusions (and underlying assumptions) to evaluate each of them on whether they are true or false. If you have to do this to 30 things instead of 3, there is a higher probability of a logical error somewhere in the 30 than the 3. Occams alone however, can get you into trouble.

**Hanlon’s razor** is the principle “Do not assume malice when something is adequately explained by stupidity”. It is useful in this world of speculations as to who is a shill/bad actor. There may well be bad actors among us, and at the same time always ask yourself, could this person also just be wrong due to poor logic or ignorance? The affirmative answer to that question is more likely than malicious intent. Hanlon's razor comes to an end when ignorance/being misinformed/being wrong due to poor logic ceases to be a convincing explanation. In any case please remember not to baselessly accuse people of being shills, if you have suspicions please use modmail to message the mod team.

Y'all gon like this one

**Hitchen's razor:** 

"that which can be asserted without evidence *can be dismissed without evidence*" 

(careful with what you define as evidence for the condition of this razor, different ranges of speculative-solid theories, in different sorts of fields, with different variables, can necessitate an adjustment of what sort of working definition 'evidence'  the context requires. eg: empirical science requires a different sort of support/evidence vs. a speculative post on reddit about where someone thinks they found some hidden shorts but aren't sure)

Edit: a commenter who teaches formal logic at uni included their response to students who like to 'ask' about why one answer to the first question of the simple validity test means that the argument is valid. His comment goes as follows:

"One way I explain the "Don't ask" bit of the simple test for validity is the following. An argument is valid if and only if it is impossible that the premises are true and the conclusion is false. So if it is impossible that all the premises are true at the same time, then it is impossible that all the premises are true at the same time and the conclusion is false. Therefore, any argument with inconsistent premises is valid."

**Note, this is continuously improved and added to until I feel the energy to write another one of these on informal logic**
