<p>HEDGIES CAN DELAY THE M.O.A.S.S WAY MORE THAN WHAT SOME OF YOU ARE IMAGINING. You are literally fighting against some of the most financially powerful entities on Earth, and just because they are trapped and need to cover sooner or later doesn't mean they'll give up without fighting back. I'm seeing a lot of well intentioned apes hyping dates even if we should not! </p>
<p>The only way for them to get out of their hole alive is to make us sell by playing with time. As long as they meet their margin call's requirements, have liquidity or can generate more synthetic shares to manipulate the stock price, they'll hold their shorts. Their goal is not even to cover without going bankrupt; they do not want to cover at all. </p>
<p>Please don't do dates or have any expectations. No one knows when M.O.A.S.S. will happen. No one knows how M.O.A.S.S. will unfold. I'm not against any of the fundamental and technical analysis studied and done by our apes to predict the next price impulses or so, but these aren't a guaranteed truth, only probabilities. No dates, no prices, just up. Setting up expectations for retail through shills and hyped dates and then breaking them to make us sell is the only strategy left for them. </p>
<p>Be patient. We set the price. We own the float. It is just a matter of time.</p>
