<h1>I'm gonna keep this simple.</h1>
<ul>
<li>Jim Cramer pumping retail investors to buy GME?</li>
<li>MSM also urging the same thing?</li>
<li>FTD T+21 clearing cycle could be complete?</li>
<li><em>Why would they urge buys if they weren't done or have enough legitimate shares at hand to clear FTDs?</em></li>
<li>Shorts have been borrowing to short sell for days, and probably didn't short yesterday because they know shit's about to go up?</li>
<li><em>It's in their best interest to start shorting as high as possible while avoiding margin call - so they wouldn't short it at $150/160 yesterday knowing it still needs to rise further</em></li>
<li>Large open interest for Puts @ $300 strike?</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>In my opinion, this all boils down to a very simple prediction:</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buying pressure would probably go unfiltered on the way up</strong> <strong>~~today~~</strong> <strong>soon, shorts are counting on paper hands joining, people would be excited and a massive short-sell dump of the borrowed shares would follow.</strong></li>
<li><strong>This would scare off the newcomers, causing further dumping via paperhands after their short - at which point they would recommence their filtering of buy pressure and allow shorts to instantly cover for a quick profit while hammering retail investor morale to not get back into $GME.</strong></li>
<li><strong>From the puts open interest - price would very probably land on a floor lower than $300 after dump.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>If you're looking to buy I think I don't have to recommend when would be the best time for you to do so. I'm counting on all of us to be strong and know what's possible on the horizon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GOOD LUCK &lt;3</strong></p>
