# I'm gonna keep this simple.

* Jim Cramer pumping retail investors to buy GME?
* MSM also urging the same thing?
* FTD T+21 clearing cycle could be complete?
   * *Why would they urge buys if they weren't done or have enough legitimate shares at hand to clear FTDs?*
* Shorts have been borrowing to short sell for days, and probably didn't short yesterday because they know shit's about to go up?
   * *It's in their best interest to start shorting as high as possible while avoiding margin call - so they wouldn't short it at $150/160 yesterday knowing it still needs to rise further*
* Large open interest for Puts @ $300 strike?

# In my opinion, this all boils down to a very simple prediction:

* **Buying pressure would probably go unfiltered on the way up** **~~today~~** **soon, shorts are counting on paper hands joining, people would be excited and a massive short-sell dump of the borrowed shares would follow.**
* **This would scare off the newcomers, causing further dumping via paperhands after their short - at which point they would recommence their filtering of buy pressure and allow shorts to instantly cover for a quick profit while hammering retail investor morale to not get back into $GME.**
* **From the puts open interest - price would very probably land on a floor lower than $300 after dump.**

**If you're looking to buy I think I don't have to recommend when would be the best time for you to do so. I'm counting on all of us to be strong and know what's possible on the horizon.**

**GOOD LUCK <3**
