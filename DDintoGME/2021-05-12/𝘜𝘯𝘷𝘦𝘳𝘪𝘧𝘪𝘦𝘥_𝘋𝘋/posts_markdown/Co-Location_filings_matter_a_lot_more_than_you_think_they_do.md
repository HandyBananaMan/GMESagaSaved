First sub post, had to shut this thing down. You guys have been dismissing the **bread and fucking butter** of Citadel's profit structure: High-Frequency Trade Difference Profit Scalping.

I present argument 1: The SEC is looking at Virtu and Citadel.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-sec-chairman-sets-sights-on-citadel-securities-and-virtu-11620576000](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-sec-chairman-sets-sights-on-citadel-securities-and-virtu-11620576000)

Who is Virtu? Among other things, they are the biggest dark pool owner in Canada. 65% of all dark pool trades. Accounts for 7% of their exchange volume in total. Sound familiar?

The name of that dark pool? ITG TriAct MatchNow. Note them listed in the Co-Location "third party services" section of the filing.

[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91388.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2021/34-91388.pdf)

The ITG TriAct MatchNow has been acquired in August 2020 by CBOE: [https://www.thetradenews.com/cboe-completes-acquisition-of-dark-pool-matchnow-from-virtu-financial/](https://www.thetradenews.com/cboe-completes-acquisition-of-dark-pool-matchnow-from-virtu-financial/)

" Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Cboe noted that the purchase price is not material from a financial perspective. " - [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/banking-essentials-newsletter-may-edition](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/banking-essentials-newsletter-may-edition)

So Virtu sold the biggest dark pool in Canada for a financially immaterial offering. Sit on that.

If you don't know who CBOE is: "Cboe Global Markets is an American company that owns the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets."

They run several exchanges, including the BZX Exchange, BYX Exchange, EDGA Exchange, and EDGX Exchange, and now own MatchNow.

And now proposals for connectivity, systems access, and co-location services are proposed by all the NYSE branches in March.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Small aside: If you ever wondered who designed the system and requirements for transparency for the ATS markets, it's this guy, Luparello, who's been working for Citadel since 2017:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, so why does connectivity and co-location matter? Simple.

&#x200B;

The National Best Bid and Offer.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp)

"**Understanding the National Best Bid and Offer**

The NBBO is calculated and disseminated by Security Information Processors (SIP) as part of the National Market System Plan (NMSP), which is used to process security prices. There are two SIPs responsible for this task. The Consolidated Quotation System gives the NBBO for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, NY-ARCA, and NY-MKT, whereas the Unlisted Trading Privileges Quote Data Feed gives the NBBO for securities listed on the NASDAQ.

The NBBO updates throughout the day with the highest and lowest offers for a security among all exchanges and market makers. The lowest ask price and the highest bid price are displayed in the NBBO and are not required to come from the same exchange. The best bid and ask price from a single exchange or market maker is called the “best bid and offer,” rather than the NBBO. Dark pools and other alternative trading systems may not always appear in these results, given the less transparent nature of their businesses."

More on the NBBO: [https://www.sec.gov/comments/265-29/26529-11.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/265-29/26529-11.pdf)

MatchNow (among others) now gets to be included in the NBBO for the NYSE. As per the wording of the filings "at their own discretion," so updating offers when and however often they want to.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Bread and Fucking Butter

SO, this fee structure/co-location filing is the infrastructure to integrate them onto the NBBO for NYSE. The fee structure also **inherently disincentivizes fast connections**, because faster = more costly.

Could this be why Citadel was investing into the NYSE's CEO's wife's SuperPAC?---->

"High-frequency traders generally invest in specialized infrastructure in order to directly connect to exchanges and process orders faster than other brokerages. In effect, they do not rely on SIP data for their buy/offer bids and take advantage of the latency between calculation of the NBBO and its publishing to mint profits. Recent research has focused on whether this enables them to front-run others.

According to a 2014 University of Michigan study, traders profited by as much as $21 billion by taking advantage of this latency. "By anticipating future NBBO, an HFT algorithm can capitalize on cross-market disparities before they are reflected in the public price quote, in effect jumping ahead of incoming orders to pocket a small but sure proﬁt. Naturally, this precipitates an arms race, as an even faster trader can calculate an NBBO to see the future of NBBO, and so on," the study's authors write." " still quoting from: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary-

The SEC said it was looking at Virtu and Citadel right before it tried to turn off this infrastructure filing.

Virtu owned the biggest dark pool in Canada, made an arrangement with CBOE for new ownership in August, then it got integrated into the National Best Bid and Offer infrastructure system for the NYSE at the end of March. (Among other dark pools, like ones where users get to SET THEIR OWN FUCKING PRICE D:<)

The same infrastructure filing also set up a fee schedule that inherently disincentivizes fast data feed connections to the NBBO system.

High Frequency Trading firms like Citadel and Virtu profit off scalping the difference in the prices between the nationally offered bid (NBBO) and their super-fast connections to the actual alternative trade exchange systems.

They just tried to sneak some of the biggest, darkest, most manipulative exchanges into the national bid offering system, and change the system with insane fees to inherently benefit HFT firms.

This was a massive move they tried to make and it's being seriously underappreciated. It would have meant a lot more money in Citadel's pockets.

SEC was right to say no.

This was a much bigger deal than you guys seem to think.

\-----

TL;DR- My argument is this-

Citadel bribed NYSE through a SuperPAC to make infrastructure changes to the national best bid and offer co-location feed arrangements. They wanted the NYSE to set up tiered services and massive fees, so alternative exchanges would want to integrate their data to the NBBO at slower speeds which puts profit directly into Citadel's pocket. Because at it's heart, Citadel is still a fucking scalper.

A nasty, overgrown cyst of a scalper, but a scalper nonetheless.
