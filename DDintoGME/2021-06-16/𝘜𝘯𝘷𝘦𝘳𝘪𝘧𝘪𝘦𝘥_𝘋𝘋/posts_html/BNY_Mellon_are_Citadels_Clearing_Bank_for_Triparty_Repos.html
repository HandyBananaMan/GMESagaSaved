<p>With the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o13686/am_i_reading_this_correctly_from_041321_citadel/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf">new found document</a> outlining Citadel’s agreement for a line of credit with BNY Mellon, I wanted to point out that BNY Mellon are one of two clearing banks. The other is JP Morgan (who last I knew severely limited operations). In the triparty repo market, their role is to settle the transaction of various securities, and particularly government securities (Treasury securities, agency MBS). </p>
<p>Previously I have written about Citadel’s role in the repo market (<img alt="found here" src="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nypf3d/citadel_and_the_7_citadels/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf" />). Effectively, they are able to act as secondary market makers for government bonds (with a role nobody else has). This puts them in a similar situation with Treasury securities as with GME. I know you’re thinking it, and yes, this is exactly the collateral used in Overnight Reverse Repos. Though Citadel are not Fed ON RRP counterparties, BNY Mellon are.</p>
<p>In order to act in this capacity, Citadel must have an account set up with a clearing bank to settle trades with institutional counterparties through their clearing bank (BNY Mellon).</p>
<p>Also, final note, Pershing = BNY Mellon, if you see that anywhere.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Citadel are using every play in their book, no holds barred. This line of credit isn’t with just any old bank, it’s with a bank that lets them be a market maker for government bonds.</p>
