What the title says.

In this post from dlauer [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhtt04/cost\_basis\_and\_trade\_price\_issues/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhtt04/cost_basis_and_trade_price_issues/) he said we should file a whistleblower complaint. Has anyone followed this up or have an idea about what's going on?
