<p>It is time, my fellow Apes, to drown out the noise and focus on our individual exit strategies and preparations for the MOASS and the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>I just want to say what a pleasure it has been to share this journey with you all. I have felt the love from you and I hope you will feel it back from me in this contribution.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've swapped over to updating this one, which also contains DDs from the entire story.</p>

<p>I get a bit emotional typing those emojis, knowing that one day soon they will represent the past, as glorious as that past is going to be.</p>
<p>This list is nothing more than my personal list of DDs and advice that I am studying to prepare for the MOASS. I invite you to help me build this in the comments. This list covers a wide variety of topics, from the financial and technical to the cultural and psychological, but avoids the investigatory. I am grateful to all of these authors for their contributions to our individual success.</p>
<p>I'm adding this section a few weeks later. This is my master list of DD that gets us to where we are going. People are always asking for a guide to the "basic" DD, here's mine.</p>

<p>See you on the moon.</p>
<p>Blanderson</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Thank you all for the kind words, let me just say to all of you that you are very welcome. üíï</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Some good advice from the comments:</p>
<p>u/lemon01747: "It may do everyone some good to download or copy these posts in some way, as apes have speculated that during MOASS, reddit will likely go down due to overwhelming traffic or a coordinated attack (to disrupt communication)."</p>
<p>I suggested printing them to PDF, which is what I have done.</p>
<p>u/LootHound_Antilles: " Apes should write out their exit MOASS strategy and put it on their bathroom mirror. When we launch, go review and take a deep breath and trust yourself that wrote out your plan without the adrenaline rush."</p>
