<p>So, I'm finally allowed to share something that I feel if it at least gets to one person and gets one more vote, then I'll be happy I tried. My buddy and I both bought back into GME on Apr 22nd. At the time I was in RobbingHood. I was reading some DD one day and saw someone post about searching the word proxy in email, and for shit and giggles I did. After TONS of lurking (not a social media fan) and reading and learning, I thought that if I hadn't got the shares be the 15th, that I didn't get a vote, so I never even tried or thought about it. To my surprise, RH had in fact sent me a proxy to vote with, and my friend as well.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, I finally got the courage to get my ass out of RH(first time trader) and transferred to Fidelity. I saw some posts about cost basis and it being all messed up, so naturally that was the first thing that I checked. Well what do you know, it was jacked up, and said that I had owned shared as far back as Jan during the first sneeze. I wasn't even trading then. (maybe why I was able to vote?)  Like I said, Even if this gets to one person, then it will be worth it for me. There is still some time...</p>

<p>TL:DR - I got shares on the 22nd of April, and was able to vote. RH fuckery, of course, they picked up shares for me in Jan. when I wasn't even trading. The cost basis on Fidelity told the truth when I transferred.</p>

<p>Edit 1 - If anyone would like to take this info to a place it could possibly get a little more exposure, EVERY VOTE COUNTS!!</p>

<p>Edit 2 - I cannot change header, but the DM's I sent were to u/criand and u/HomeDepotHank69 .. I know these are busy guys, and not trying to call anyone out, but just wanted to clarify where the no response to DM's came from</p>
