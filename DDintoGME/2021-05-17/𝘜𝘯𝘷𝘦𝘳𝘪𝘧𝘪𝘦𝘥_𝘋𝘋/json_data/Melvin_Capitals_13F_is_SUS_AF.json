    "selftext": "Melvin Capital does not list a single PUT option in their 13F.  Did they close every single short position they had, and all associate puts????  NOT JUST GME.   EVERYTHING!!!!\n\n6 million shares worth of GME puts are gone.  They had been building this position for over a year.  Are we supposed to believe all 6 million puts expired?  \n\nCitadel upped their position on GME puts by over 1 million shares.  They haven't covered their shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of their filings are here:  [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1628110](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1628110)\n\nI'm only marking this as DD because I will be adding to it and would really like some more input.",
