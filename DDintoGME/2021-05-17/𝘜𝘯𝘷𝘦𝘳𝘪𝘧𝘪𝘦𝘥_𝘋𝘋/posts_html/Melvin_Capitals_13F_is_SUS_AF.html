<p>Melvin Capital does not list a single PUT option in their 13F.  Did they close every single short position they had, and all associate puts????  NOT JUST GME.   EVERYTHING!!!!</p>
<p>6 million shares worth of GME puts are gone.  They had been building this position for over a year.  Are we supposed to believe all 6 million puts expired?  </p>
<p>Citadel upped their position on GME puts by over 1 million shares.  They haven't covered their shorts.</p>

<p>All of their filings are here:  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1628110">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1628110</a></p>
<p>I'm only marking this as DD because I will be adding to it and would really like some more input.</p>
