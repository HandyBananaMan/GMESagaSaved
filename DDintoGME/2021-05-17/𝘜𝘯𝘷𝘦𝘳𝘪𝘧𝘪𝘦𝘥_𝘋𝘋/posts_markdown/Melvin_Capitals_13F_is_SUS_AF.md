Melvin Capital does not list a single PUT option in their 13F.  Did they close every single short position they had, and all associate puts????  NOT JUST GME.   EVERYTHING!!!!

6 million shares worth of GME puts are gone.  They had been building this position for over a year.  Are we supposed to believe all 6 million puts expired?  

Citadel upped their position on GME puts by over 1 million shares.  They haven't covered their shorts.

All of their filings are here:  [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1628110](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1628110)

I'm only marking this as DD because I will be adding to it and would really like some more input.
