#Title: Is this legal? Looks like Steven Cohen’s Point72 partners filed to have Employee Investment Funds exempt from the rules, be held in offshore accounts, and maybe even “short” them? Filed @ SEC June 16th. Am I reading this right? Is this what Kenny’s been doing too while hiding from Apes & GME?
