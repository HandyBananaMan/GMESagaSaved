(these ETF by nature are balanced and risk adverse it was a leap to think they could buy it up through the ETFS) they have 6 million in one, a couple hundred thousand in another.  Probably over 10 million worth of the bonds in these ETFS.  Another thing is buying through the ETF is not very smart as BlackRock wouldn't have total control of the Debt through the ETF and its also publicly reported (my idiot ass found it)\n\n....but if someone wanted to buy up Citadels debt they would do it through these bonds, we cant find that information out as it is a private placement Bond. They would just buy them up through the Bond Market.\n\nSee [The\\_Captain\\_Slog Again](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mw96bf/citadel_bond_info_blackrock_and_ryan_cohens_tweet/gvhrm4n?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nI learned a little abut Bonds thanks to the\\_Captain\\_Slog\n\nI hope this Helps, I still think having these bonds out there is significant.  Anyone can buy up this Debt.  It should be interesting to watch these bonds vs similar bonds on how they preform.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTLDR- Citadel has 1.6 Billion of corporate Debt.  ~~Ishares (blackrock) bought all 3 bonds on 4/20.~~  They have monthly reporting so they reported on that Date, so that is why it all says 4/20, Ryan Cohen tweeted a gif of a BEAR BOND on 4-20. **(I still think the bonds are shit and maybe this was his meaning....)**  Tell me what this means!!!!!!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Found the Bonds still need help what it means!\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCitadel has 3 current outstanding Bonds, 500m, 500m, and 600m, total of 1.6 Billion in corporate debt.\n\nAll of them are international bonds, so you wont find them on fidelity bond listing.\n\nSomeone bought all 3 of them on.......4/20 I just had to put that up here.\n\nFirst the Data\n\nBond #1\n\n500M, issued 2017, coupon 5.37%, Maturity Ja2023, Call December 2022, rating BBB\n\nBookrunner- JP Morgan, UBS Depository- Clearstream Banking SA Euoclear Bank\n\n**Cusip ID-  17288XAA2**\n\n[Bond Info](https://preview.redd.it/827v3wlr6ru61.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f2c97d362b42cb867eb668187af3701e8db3bb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[3 month Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/7sqwoh4t6ru61.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81617c1b67f4d07ea911ded75e237c90abcc93a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[IShares buys4\\/20.....nice dude](https://preview.redd.it/i3e8zz9x6ru61.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b2466a3d3306c79138ad4816c92fe9daf0fb07)\n\nBond #2-\n\n500m bond, Issued 2019, 4.875% coupon rate, Maturity Jan/2027, Call option Nov 2026, Rating BBB\n\nBookRunner- Goldman Sachs, UBS Depository- Clearstream Banking S.A Euroclear Bank\n\nCuspit Id-  17288XAB0\n\n[Bond Info](https://preview.redd.it/cmuhr3ed7ru61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f5b8623fe14d884f1c5de037bdb8e0c149b9a8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[3 month price chart](https://preview.redd.it/jo99c9of7ru61.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd734287843d7e147560baa019a5cddba56c8bb8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ishares 4\\/20....you guys are funny](https://preview.redd.it/a43rvsci7ru61.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc7a94b5cadd849766649c5f55dd0a3e4b1c307)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBond #3\n\n600M bond, Issued 3/03/2021, 3.375 Coupon, Maturity March 2026, Call Feb 2026 Rating -BBB\n\nBookrunner BoFA Securities, Goldman Sachs, UBS.
