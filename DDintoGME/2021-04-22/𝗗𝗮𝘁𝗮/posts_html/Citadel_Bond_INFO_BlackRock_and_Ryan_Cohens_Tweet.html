<p>CItadel has three bonds and have used the first two in the past to fund dividends to the owners (not for operations)</p>

<p>So when they issued a third bond in March(BBB- by the way, a step below the other two in a hot economy) I became interested in looking at the bonds.</p>
<p>I thought I found that Blackrock through Ishare bought a lot of the bonds, that is not true.</p>
<p>They own a good amount through the ETFs but not enough to be significant. (these ETF by nature are balanced and risk adverse it was a leap to think they could buy it up through the ETFS) they have 6 million in one, a couple hundred thousand in another.  Probably over 10 million worth of the bonds in these ETFS.  Another thing is buying through the ETF is not very smart as BlackRock wouldn't have total control of the Debt through the ETF and its also publicly reported (my idiot ass found it)</p>
<p>....but if someone wanted to buy up Citadels debt they would do it through these bonds, we cant find that information out as it is a private placement Bond. They would just buy them up through the Bond Market.</p>

<p>I learned a little abut Bonds thanks to the_Captain_Slog</p>
<p>I hope this Helps, I still think having these bonds out there is significant.  Anyone can buy up this Debt.  It should be interesting to watch these bonds vs similar bonds on how they preform.</p>

<p>TLDR- Citadel has 1.6 Billion of corporate Debt.  ~~Ishares (blackrock) bought all 3 bonds on 4/20.~~  They have monthly reporting so they reported on that Date, so that is why it all says 4/20, Ryan Cohen tweeted a gif of a BEAR BOND on 4-20. <strong>(I still think the bonds are shit and maybe this was his meaning....)</strong>  Tell me what this means!!!!!!</p>
<p>*************Found the Bonds still need help what it means!***************</p>
<p>Citadel has 3 current outstanding Bonds, 500m, 500m, and 600m, total of 1.6 Billion in corporate debt.</p>
<p>All of them are international bonds, so you wont find them on fidelity bond listing.</p>
<p>Someone bought all 3 of them on.......4/20 I just had to put that up here.</p>

<p>Ok so the bond debt will be right below the secured bank debt but above everyone else including the individual investors.</p>
<p>~~Why would Blackrock want to buy a bunch of Bear bonds on 4/20?~~</p>

<p>Does this give a bigger seat at the table when Citadel is liquidated, protects there other investments from the fallout. (whoever buys these bonds would have a seat at the table)</p>
