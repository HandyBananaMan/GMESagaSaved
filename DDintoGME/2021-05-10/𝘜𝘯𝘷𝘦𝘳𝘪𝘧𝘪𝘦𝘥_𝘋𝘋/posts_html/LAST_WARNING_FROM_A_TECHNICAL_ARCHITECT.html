<p>First let me say this is not financial advise, but for certain some technical advise on RHs failure.</p>
<p>Working as an IT architect for various large institutions during my career and now, I can tell you....THERE IS NO FUCKING SERVER FAILURE AT THESE KIND OF COMPANIES....EVER</p>
<p>No single medium sized company would let you implement their system...whatever it may be... in a SPOF (Single Point Of Failure) setup in a production (live) environment. </p>
<p>It is MANDATORY(!!BY REGULATION) by various IT regulatory obligations, that while handling sensitive real-time data there must be a disaster recovery plan in the form of a instant-failover once a failure occurs to the production system. This ofcourse depends on juristiction, but I can personally guarantee you the following: Not a single CTO would let their systems be implemented without said disaster recovery.</p>
<p>My guess would be that it is an orchestrated technical setup in their system, to initiate these downtime frames. There is no other logical or technical explanation..</p>
<p>TLDR;</p>
<p>PLASE GTFO ROBINdaHOOD</p>
