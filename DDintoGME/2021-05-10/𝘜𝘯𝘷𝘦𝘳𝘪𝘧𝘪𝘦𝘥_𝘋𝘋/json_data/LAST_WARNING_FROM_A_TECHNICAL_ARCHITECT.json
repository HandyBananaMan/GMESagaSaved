This ofcourse depends on juristiction, but I can personally guarantee you the following: Not a single CTO would let their systems be implemented without said disaster recovery.\n\nMy guess would be that it is an orchestrated technical setup in their system, to initiate these downtime frames. There is no other logical or technical explanation..\n\nTLDR;\n\nPLASE GTFO ROBINdaHOOD",
