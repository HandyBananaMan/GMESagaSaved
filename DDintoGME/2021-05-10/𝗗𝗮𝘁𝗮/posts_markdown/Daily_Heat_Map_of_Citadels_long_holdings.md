It occurred to me that one way to see if Citadel is starting to feel the squeeze by having to liquidate to stay ahead of margin requirements on their shorts is to watch the movement on their biggest holdings. If they're trying to increase liquidity, they're likely to shave off parts of all their holdings, but I suspect, given their media control and general fuckery, that they will pick certain sectors and shave only those, so boomers can read in MarketWatch that tech stocks are down today, or there's a drop in consumer cyclical with some line about WHY it happened. That way it blends into the overall market and doesn't spook other investors.

So, I built a heat map of their top 50 long holdings, as disclosed in their 12/31/2020 13F filing, using closing prices as of today, 5/10/2021.

Certainly seems like the reds today were limited to tech and communication. They also were some of Citadel's largest holdings. If my theory holds, they'll cut some healthcare, industrials, and consumer staples tomorrow and we'll see dips in those sectors.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the kudos! I am shocked and humbled by the number of upvotes.

Regarding their options holdings, it's hard to represent them in a heatmap, but I did include tickers for which their primary holdings are calls and puts. Because options have differing strikes and expirations, and they appear to sometimes be taking both sides of a ticker's movement, it's hard to track options as an indicator, I think. Perhaps someone can provide me with a way of looking at their options that is useful.

I did notice that EEM was on their list, and it also saw it in today's list of top open interest (OI) in the whole market for puts.

Someone asked for the 13F link, so I'll share my links here:[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)[https://www.holdingschannel.com/13f/citadel-advisors-llc-top-holdings/](https://www.holdingschannel.com/13f/citadel-advisors-llc-top-holdings/)

Edit 2: Not sure the best way to share the next days' update, but I'll just add a link here for May 11:
