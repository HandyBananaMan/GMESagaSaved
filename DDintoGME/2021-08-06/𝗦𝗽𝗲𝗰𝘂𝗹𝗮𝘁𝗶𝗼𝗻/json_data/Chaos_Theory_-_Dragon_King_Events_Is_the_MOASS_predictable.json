    "selftext": "Chaos theory. in mechanics and mathematics, the study of apparently random or unpredictable behavior in systems governed by deterministic laws. \n\nA dragon king event is a large scale massive event that is formerly considered a black swan event. A black swan event is considered a rare, unpredictable, once in a lifetime occurrence that evolves from chaotic systems. The theory was put forward by Didier Sornette\n\nA dragon king event can be anything that is considered a massive outlier on a statistical, logarithmic scale. And when I say anything, I mean anything. From predicting massive earthquakes, to city population size, potential space disasters, *stock market crashes*, epileptic seizures, etc... If there is a scale with outliers there are dragon king events.\n\nAfter 2008 and the financial crash, Didier Sornette, director of financial crisis observatory, developed this theory with the hypothesis that such events are actually predictable, and in term, preventable. \n\n\"Sornette explains that there are instabilities within complex systems: feedback, tipping points and other unappreciated correlations and dynamics. These undiscovered characteristics are nonlinear and can amplify consequence to extreme levels.\" \n\nhttp://www.sigmarisk.com/news/2017/7/25/black-swans-and-dragon-kings\n\nHypothesis I: Financial bubbles can be identified in real time\n\nHypothesis II: The end of the financial bubble can be assessed using probabilistic forecasts\n\nIn case of dragon kings, the mechanism is basically a gradual maturation towards instability, represented by the bubble the end point of which is usually the crash. And it is hard for standard techniques to predict such a non-linear mechanism. The core of the inner instability of the system has to be identified and the tiny causal perturbations recognized in order to get to the cause of the crash or crisis.\n\n\nhttp://www.sachinmittal.com/2016/06/02/how-to-predict-financial-crisis-the-dragon-king-theory-vs-the-black-swan/\n\n\n#Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles\n\nThroughout history we've suffered many an economic bubble, multiple concurrent days where crashes in the tens of percent in the overall have occured. Massive drops in crypto and housing markets. We can and have  researched many factors that come into play with systemic corruption and unfair market practices etc... But overall, **The core factor is when a system has developed an instability, any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control.**\n\nThe more complex the system, the more likely and inevitable a dragon king event will occur. Kept to itself, a closed system will eventually keep homeostasis. Complex systems require precise calculations to make them work. Any deviation or change in variables can contribute to change in the outcome or functioning. \n\nWithin the system, you will find things start ramping up and ramping out of control exponentially. In the following paper, two scientists studying voltage oscillations with two circuits in synch, they found most of the time the two would oscillate together like a pair of swinging pendulums, with only slight deviations away from synchronization. \n\n\"Gauthier and his colleagues have shown that the differences in the circuits\u2019 voltages during these desynchronisations are indeed dragon-kings. \u201cThey were as big as the system would physically allow, like a major disaster,\u201d Gauthier says.\n\nThe pair went on to show that they could reliably forecast when a big event was about to happen; whenever the differences between the circuits\u2019 oscillations decreased to a certain value, a leap of dragon-king proportions was almost always imminent. And once they saw it coming, they found they could apply a small electrical nudge to one circuit to make sure it didn\u2019t tear away from the other\"\n\n**We basically kill the dragon-king in the egg,\u201d Sornette says. \u201cThe counter-mechanism kills it when it is burgeoning**\n\n\n\"by using this system to find out at what stage in the process a dragon-king can be prevented, Sornette hopes to see whether financial regulation could prevent a crash once a stock market bubble has already begun to grow, a controversial topic among regulators.\n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029443-000-slaying-dragon-kings-could-prevent-financial-crashes/\n\n********\n\nIn context of gme\n\nJan spike wasn't odd- gme had been increasing steadily as far back as Aug 2020. Rc first took stake in gme in September of 2020. He did not join the board until Jan 2021. These are but some of the factors smart individual investors like dfv looked out for-potential price fluctuations that accounted for good fundamentals and exponential meta changes regarding the company. \n\nIn 2008 its been hypothesized that the housing market crash never resolved, it was kicked down the road. We had market fluctuations in 2015, 2018, but continued exponential growth overall esp in 2020. All political administrations supported and encouraged growth and turned a blind eye to illegal market practices within trading and the market. We were hit with a massive unforeseen event in March 2020-global shutdown which heavily beat down the stock market and major exchanges. This was stopped by one of the largest financial stimulus we have ever had which offset what seemed to be an inevitable correction due to the economic strain the pandemic had on the world. \n\nWe have found oscillations within multiple company's stock prices. At times they follow to a T, at times deviate. Gme may or may not be the center of this, but it has the focus. In feb, several brokers effective culled purchasing (and at times selling) power for gme and other meme stocks. \n\nA large deviation is inevitable. The MOASS is the dragon king we have been discussing. The bubble will pop. \n\n*******\n\n**but can we really slay the dragon?**\n\nPer Sornette, if you can study these bubbles, study the fluctuations, study the variables, you can effectively stop a dragon king event before it starts. Let me include a few excerpts from this article https://www.wired.com/2013/10/chaos-theory-dragon-kings/\n\n\"Stop a stock trade and avoid a catastrophic global financial crash. Seal a microscopic crack and prevent a rocket explosion. Push a button to avert a citywide blackout\" - the first one stood out at me, for obvious reasons. \n\n\"Even in something like a financial system, the key parameter may be the amount of money each individual in the world has. Changing something like that might be out of the realm of possibility. In complex systems 'it\u2019s possible the laws are simple, but maybe the parameters we need to control are not very accessible' \" \n\n insert Thanos gif 'I am inevitable' \n\n\nUsing statistical analysis, they search for what he called \u201ctrenchant super-exponential growth,\u201d which is where the price of an asset grows much faster than a simple compound interest. It is possible that such behavior is a warning bell for financial bubbles.\n\nOh my, isn't this something that is occurring with almost... Well everything? \n\n\nLink to original pdf\n\n https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4290\n\n\nLastly, this Ted talk by Sornette \nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/didier_sornette_how_we_can_predict_the_next_financial_crisis/up-next\n\nHe discusses how to predict dragon kings in the financial market and use them to stop a market crash, bubble popping, or bubble forming. Skip to 15:30 on the video for the part I refer to-\n\nBy adding tiny perturbations at the right time you are able to control the outcome. You can effectively add a little kick that will destabilize the system.\n\nGME appears to have had many \"tiny perturbations\" happen to it over the past 6 months. Between random fluctuations in its share price. Making odd leaps end of day. Shutting down trading. Spikes and flash crashes. What we see as manipulation, may be done for this reason. \n\nBut my favorite line these researchers have written?\n\n**\u201cThe fear of central banks is that their intervention might actually worsen the situation and trigger the crashes, destabilising the system even further\u201d**\n\nUnless you are blind you know that just about every market from corn to swimming pools to housing to crypto is just begging to go tits up. At what point do these manipulations fail or backfire?",
