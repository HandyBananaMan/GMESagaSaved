# Title: This price action isn’t boring it’s exciting af. 155 probably triggers a shit ton of buy orders so they’re walking a perilous tightrope right now. This means margin requirements are closing in, they’re not comfortable leaving price over 160 and are willing to risk taking it down right next to 155

If this $4 range between 156-160 is their sweet spot how many sessions can they keep it pinned there? When will all those people with limit buys at 155 decide 156 or 157 are just as good of a deal and pull the trigger? What will happen on Wednesday when gme gets added to s&p 400? If you’re bored right now you’re not paying attention to the actual state of play.
