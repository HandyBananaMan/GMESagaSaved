# After-Market

Well the really tried to slam us below that 157 resistance the puts on the options chain were coming in hot but it held ending the day above 157 even if just slightly was a pretty big win as it invalidated the efforts of 17.1M dollars worth of contracts. Thank you all and see you tomorrow.

Edit 4 3:10

Hit a high at 161.25 and then dipped back below VWAP not a lot of momentum either way today just slow crawl down slow crawl up ...

Edit 3 1:36

Finally crossed back above VWAP a little extra volume flowing in. Be interested to see if we start to run off this.

Edit 2 11:56

Managing to hold 157 for now spy is coming down a bit and since our volume is till low I expect that to drag us around some.

Edit 1 10:00

Not the worst morning so far climbed up quickly from the morning short volume is ok around 400k and nice bounce on VWAP

# Pre-Market Analysis

Not a lot that I didn't cover in the [weekly post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ow16bf/jerkin_it_with_gherkinit_forward_looking_ta_for/), be sure to check that out. Volume is around 17k right now, with 15k shares to borrow. So nothing crazy just that weird movement at the end of day on Friday. We are currently trading on that low support at 162.00.
