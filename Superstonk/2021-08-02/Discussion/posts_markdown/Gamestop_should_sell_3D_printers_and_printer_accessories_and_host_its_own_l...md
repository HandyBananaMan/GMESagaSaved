 (game storage cases, controller grips, small statues)

Imagine that - getting to start a hobby and not being bound to Amazoff for supplies?

3D printing is electronics and gaming adjacant and having an easy-to-use one-stop store for supplies would for sure make it easier and more fun to explore for many.

Edit: like Elegoo printers for example. Affordable enough, I just want Gamestop to sell me one, thanks
