<p>(game storage cases, controller grips, small statues)</p>
<p>Imagine that - getting to start a hobby and not being bound to Amazoff for supplies?</p>
<p>3D printing is electronics and gaming adjacant and having an easy-to-use one-stop store for supplies would for sure make it easier and more fun to explore for many.</p>
<p>Edit: like Elegoo printers for example. Affordable enough, I just want Gamestop to sell me one, thanks</p>
