<h1>Title: The fact that they’re so obsessed with keeping us from going green is a major indicator we’re near the end because it’s all about optics and psychology for them now.</h1>

<p>I can clearly visualize the shfs meeting with their psyops team now. The psychologists have formulated what they think is the best plan of attack. “You’ve got to make them think they’ll never see green again. Make them believe it’s hopeless. That the game actually IS rigged in our favor. That we can keep manipulating the price downwards forever and that every week it will close just a little bit lower than the week before. On and on until the investment has lost all its value. Make them believe the dream of green is a dream of the past.”</p>
<p>Well guess what you unethical piece of shit spineless pathetic excuse for human being psychologists? We have psychologists too.</p>
<p>The paradoxical fact is that the very obsession with keeping it from touching green is all the psychological proof we need to know you’re at the end of your rope and nearing defeat. Because in the big leagues finishing a couple bucks in the green or a couple bucks in the red doesn’t matter. What matters is long term trajectory if you’re a shareholder or getting puts or calls in the money if you’re playing derivatives. </p>
<p>By tanking the price hard every time it approaches green you’re showing your hand to any psychologist worth his salt. You’re trying to instill feelings of powerlessness, hopelessness, despair, apathy. But the fact that we know you’re trying to do that instills us with feelings of power, hope, and purpose. Never selling, never backing down. Only hodling with diamond hands and buying. And again, a huge fuck you to the psychologists who have attempted to use your training in human nature to screw over your fellow man. The heroes of psychology of the past on whose mighty shoulders you stand would be deeply ashamed of you.</p>
