<p>Maybe some wrinkle brains can help me out with the details, but we’ve seen one dirty trick after another, all used to fudge data and hide their ridiculous short positions. We know they have been abusing their market maker privileges to help out other SHF’s, a slap on the wrist is not enough. The American people should demand more from their politicians and financial institutions. We’ve been living in a rigged system long enough.</p>
