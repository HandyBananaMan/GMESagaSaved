<p>Hey Guys.</p>
<p>I'm a daytrader as a hobby (I am a HODLer of GME though) and I wanted to point out something interesting I noticed.</p>
<p>An indicator I use is called Market Cipher that has given me great success in trading and identifying price trends.</p>
<p>Without getting too technical for non-traders, I saw a strong buy signal flash for GME last week. This is interesting because it’s on a higher time frame chart - daily chart makes it more significant.</p>
<p>These are the green dots at the bottom of the complicated looking squiggly thing (follow the pink arrows to see)</p>

<p>The last time this buy indicator flashed was March 2, 2020. The price was $3.85.</p>
<p>Since then GME has rallied \~4500% to our current price in a little under a year and a half.</p>
<p>Notice how there have been some sizeable dumps in price along the way too.The last time the green buy signal flashed on the daily, price ended up having a big dump, only to mini-moon, and then never ever reach that price again.</p>
<p>So maybe price now goes to $100, hoping to freak retail out, but there's a HUGE amount of buyers around there and it shoots up and begins the next parabolic uptrend. I think this may happen very soon.</p>
<p>45X from here in a year and a half, with no squeeze, and better fundamentals puts us at $7K if history repeats. Not saying it will, but also not saying it won't. For more info how, Elliot Wave guy's posts can show you. Also shoutout to Rocky Outcrop and Tradespotting on youtube.</p>
<p><strong>How long are you prepared to hold if you have to? The answer is as long as it takes. This is a patience game.</strong></p>
<p>I also want to show you this other chart.</p>

<p>This chart is another indicator, and all you have to know is the yellow X's represent possible price manipulation. There are so many of them geez. These charts are in Log Scale by the way.</p>
<p>Zoomed in to 1Hr time frame:</p>

<p>Interestingly, TESLA also had tons of yellow X indicators before its slow-squeeze too. Movie stock as well. If we want to compare it to a regular stock, look at Microsoft's yellow Xs:</p>

<p>LOL. Like 2 since 2012.</p>
<p>HODL.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>It's from Market Cipher A indicator. It's usually used for crypto, but I applied it to GME and voila.</p>
<p>Copypasta:</p>
<p>The Yellow X is a bearish indicator and is intended to indicate high volume long covering that is rapidly bought up and sold short. This market condition also presents a possible opportunity for whale traders to exaggerate the condition by manipulating the rate of buyback indicating a possible bottom or reversal to breakout traders. This in turn supplies local liquidity then the whales reverse position forcing the market lower. The Yellow X is most reliable on 1 hour and above time periods.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I saw an interesting post on Trading View that showed green dot buy signals on high time frames for Bitkorn. The last time it showed a green dot was when Bitkorn was $3000. (It also recently flashed again for $9k and $31k). Makes you wonder what’s coming up for GME.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: Tesla Chart as requested.</p>

<p>FINAL EDIT:</p>
<p>Just wanted to clear a few things up for some people here. Technical analysis works. Just because it doesn't tell you the future, doesn't make it BS. It's not supposed to tell you the future and doesn't claim to, but lay out the possibilities, and narrow it down into the higher probabilities.</p>
<p>TA is not a crystal ball. It's more of a 'peek around the corner' that gives you an edge, or a slight advantage, more than guessing randomly. In trading, that is more than enough to win in the long run.</p>
<p>More importantly, the common question is does TA work on a manipulated stock?</p>
<p>Here is my take:</p>
<p>Firstly, pretty much all stocks are manipulated. Don't think anyone is surprised there. Some stocks more than others, but fundamentally TA and any price action in general is a reflection of human psychology, a map of how people tend to sell low and buy high. When stocks go up, you get excited and pile in cuz you think it will go higher (greed). When it goes low, you sell or at maybe question yourself, or need extra confirmation bias to make you feel at ease (fear).</p>
<p>GME is interesting because apes are HODLers even if the price dips, HOWEVER, even if apes own the float, don't forget there is Smart Money - institutional money that plays the game in this way with TA too. They have levels that they are looking to buy at as well. We are not the only ones watching this everyday.</p>
<p>So let's say GME does go down $100 (not saying it's probable, but anything is possible), do you know how many funds that are bullish on GME long term are going to take the opportunity to buy the crap out of it there? If it even gets there? A lot!</p>
<p>So be excited as the price dips. This is the time that retail could accumulate MORE and own the float many, many more times over.</p>
<p>When price starts hitting $350 again, most people will be STOKED. Well I'm saying (in my opinion, not financial advice) KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY NOW. Future you will thank you now.</p>
<p>And thanks for the nice words everyone. Yellow X guy. Nice ring to it.</p>
