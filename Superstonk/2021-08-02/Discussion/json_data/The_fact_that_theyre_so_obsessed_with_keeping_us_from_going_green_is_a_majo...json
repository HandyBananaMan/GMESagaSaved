    "selftext": "I can clearly visualize the shfs meeting with their psyops team now. The psychologists have formulated what they think is the best plan of attack. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make them think they\u2019ll never see green again. Make them believe it\u2019s hopeless. That the game actually IS rigged in our favor. That we can keep manipulating the price downwards forever and that every week it will close just a little bit lower than the week before. On and on until the investment has lost all its value. Make them believe the dream of green is a dream of the past.\u201d\n\nWell guess what you unethical piece of shit spineless pathetic excuse for human being psychologists? We have psychologists too.\n\nThe paradoxical fact is that the very obsession with keeping it from touching green is all the psychological proof we need to know you\u2019re at the end of your rope and nearing defeat. Because in the big leagues finishing a couple bucks in the green or a couple bucks in the red doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is long term trajectory if you\u2019re a shareholder or getting puts or calls in the money if you\u2019re playing derivatives. \n\nBy tanking the price hard every time it approaches green you\u2019re showing your hand to any psychologist worth his salt. You\u2019re trying to instill feelings of powerlessness, hopelessness, despair, apathy. But the fact that we know you\u2019re trying to do that instills us with feelings of power, hope, and purpose. Never selling, never backing down. Only hodling with diamond hands and buying. And again, a huge fuck you to the psychologists who have attempted to use your training in human nature to screw over your fellow man. The heroes of psychology of the past on whose mighty shoulders you stand would be deeply ashamed of you.",
