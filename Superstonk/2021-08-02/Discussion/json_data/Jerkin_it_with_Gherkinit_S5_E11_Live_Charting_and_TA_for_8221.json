Thank you all and see you tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e167wyw640f71.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=67056f043d9b8138100a6661a2663d6083133c2c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0nu2njja40f71.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c07a90af54fbc722091a1abeb6b651ff2893ec0\n\n\\- Gherkinit\n\nEdit 4 3:10\n\nHit a high at 161.25 and then dipped back below VWAP not a lot of momentum either way today just slow crawl down slow crawl up ...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pxt927nuze71.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=a35ec73bf52094c4ba8269ab7b6b4119db8242a6\n\nEdit 3 1:36\n\nFinally crossed back above VWAP a little extra volume flowing in. Be interested to see if we start to run off this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26yzug1pdze71.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd37d81347420baf60e31b629ffe0c615b916fd\n\nEdit 2 11:56\n\nManaging to hold 157 for now spy is coming down a bit and since our volume is till low I expect that to drag us around some.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6uhp9b1wye71.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65c1791c86c5f9dfea88f0150a6d9e75c59e879\n\nEdit 1 10:00\n\nNot the worst morning so far climbed up quickly from the morning short volume is ok around 400k and nice bounce on VWAP\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jxwedl2bye71.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&s=51e98d8c4dd4c1fab6b11c0b2daacd6ddf4e71f1\n\n# Pre-Market Analysis\n\nNot a lot that I didn't cover in the [weekly post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ow16bf/jerkin_it_with_gherkinit_forward_looking_ta_for/), be sure to check that out. Volume is around 17k right now, with 15k shares to borrow. So nothing crazy just that weird movement at the end of day on Friday. We are currently trading on that low support at 162.00.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cx52h5g6wxe71.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=51502270cc6c07985b76e2040a0228d57e55c5ea\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n*\\* Although my profession is day trading, I in no way endorse day-trading of GME not only does it present significant risk, it can delay the squeeze.*\n\n*\\*My YouTube channel is \"monetized\" if that is something you are uncomfortable with, I understand, while I wouldn't say I profit greatly from the views, I do suggest you use ad-block when viewing it if you feel so compelled.* *My intention is simply benefit this community.
