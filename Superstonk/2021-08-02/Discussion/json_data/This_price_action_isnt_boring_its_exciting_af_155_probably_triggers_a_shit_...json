When will all those people with limit buys at 155 decide 156 or 157 are just as good of a deal and pull the trigger? What will happen on Wednesday when gme gets added to s&p 400? If you\u2019re bored right now you\u2019re not paying attention to the actual state of play.",

This means margin requirements are closing in, they\u2019re not comfortable leaving price over 160 and are willing to risk taking it down right next to 155",
