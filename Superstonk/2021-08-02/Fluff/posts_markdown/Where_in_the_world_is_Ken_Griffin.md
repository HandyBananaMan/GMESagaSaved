Where in the world is Ken Griffin?

Our boy Ken has a couple of private jets.   The one we can track is a Bombardier BD700 a 16 passenger private jet.  

You can see where his plane has been by changing the date under history on the left

Since the start of all the GME fun in January Ken has made roughly 61 round trip flights between Chicago, NY, Florida, Colorado, Hawaii, Paris, Texas and Ohio.   That's a flight every 3.1 days.  

I was not able to find the carbon foot print of his exact jet, but using the newer Bombardier model (global 6500) with the same seating capacity [here](https://www.paramountbusinessjets.com/private-jet-carbon-offset-system/#time-distance-results) I can get a sense of the waste he is putting out. 

So a rough estimate of Ken's private jet's carbon foot print is 1105 metric tons of carbon dioxide produced in the last 7 months.   An equivalent for a economy seat is for the same flights is 24 mT.

Now an average car produces [4.6 metric tons](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#driving) of C02 per year.   So ken polluting the same as 240 cars per year.  

Why am I getting lectured on the environment with the Ken's doing all that damage?
