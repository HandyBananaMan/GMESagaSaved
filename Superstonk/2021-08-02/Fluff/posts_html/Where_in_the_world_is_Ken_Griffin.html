<p>Where in the world is Ken Griffin?</p>
<p>Our boy Ken has a couple of private jets.   The one we can track is a Bombardier BD700 a 16 passenger private jet.  </p>
<p>You can see where his plane has been by changing the date under history on the left

<p>Since the start of all the GME fun in January Ken has made roughly 61 round trip flights between Chicago, NY, Florida, Colorado, Hawaii, Paris, Texas and Ohio.   That's a flight every 3.1 days.  </p>
<p>I was not able to find the carbon foot print of his exact jet, but using the newer Bombardier model (global 6500) with the same seating capacity <a href="https://www.paramountbusinessjets.com/private-jet-carbon-offset-system/#time-distance-results">here</a> I can get a sense of the waste he is putting out. </p>
<p>So a rough estimate of Ken's private jet's carbon foot print is 1105 metric tons of carbon dioxide produced in the last 7 months.   An equivalent for a economy seat is for the same flights is 24 mT.</p>
<p>Now an average car produces <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#driving">4.6 metric tons</a> of C02 per year.   So ken polluting the same as 240 cars per year.  </p>
<p>Why am I getting lectured on the environment with the Ken's doing all that damage?</p>
