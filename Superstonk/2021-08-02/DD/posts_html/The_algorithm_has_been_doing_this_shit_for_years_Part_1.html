<p>I am not a financial advisor. IRL, I’m an engineer with a strong stats background who spends too much time on the internet.</p>
<p>Aight. So, shit is about to get real real here. Buckle up. Hold onto your tendies. Keep your hands diamond, your balls titanium and your butthole clenched.</p>
<h1>Background History</h1>
<p>Some time ago, I noticed a repeating trend with the GME share price. This was the image was from that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogjkao/i_think_i_figured_out_the_shorting_algorithm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">post</a>. Since people often made the comment about needing more data to prove if shit was going down, I decided to provide it.</p>

<h1>A History of C***-KEN ({°}) and McDICK 8==D~~</h1>
<p>Before I go too further, I want to identify a few key time frames. One is the Citadel Unusual Number of Tomfuckery Knavish Economy of Nakedness era occurring in the earlier years of GME (\~2008), and Melvin’s Constant Decreasing Intentional Current Kbullshit era (\~2015), which I will refer to as C***-KEN and McDICK respectfully. I have so kindly made a graphical representation of this for your viewing pleasure. Periodically, some of the dates have not been presented for formatting and scaling purposes (and because length doesn’t matter, and as a woman, I have no idea what 6 inches really is).</p>

<h1>The C*** KEN era</h1>
<p>Looking in to the past and the SEC website, Citadel started to place married options in the fucking hundred and thousands starting back in like 2008. (For this table, I stopped consolidating data from the SEC website about 2009 because it’s a bitch and I’m half lazy.)</p>

<p>How fucking bad can this get? Like…. Really? IDK. Let’s look at the GME close, GME FTD, and VIX close starting when the FTD was first recorded on 10/12/2005.</p>

<p>Hmm…. It looks as if shit got real real in late 2008 when the little red dots turned into a stream of menstrual blood basically when GME was getting a bunch of FTD’s on the rag, I mean reg.</p>

<p>Wasn’t Citadel first recorded to fuck shit up in 2008Q3?</p>

<p>What other fuckery happened around this time?! How fucking bad can this get? Like…. Really? IDK, man. Let’s look at a range of values from 01/01/2007 to 12/31/2010 to look at comparing values and also add some lines to show where 03/31/2008 and 09/30/2009 are located. It also looks inverse so let’s throw in a 1 / VIX close into that group.</p>

<p>Want to know why I clearly have identified the location of the clit in this blue waffle?!</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/yds6zcqrsze71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c78ce3e63f8e697efd6f202eca109c0402cf67b</p>
<p>This is why. Right around 11/21/2008, VIX had a high that will not be seen <strong>again until 2020</strong>.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/c2sumvhssze71.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25907548d2c41a01c3f1431cd89f090d038517a9</p>
<p>It would thus be inferred that there is a STRONG Fucking correlation of the ~~inverse~~ VIX to the C***-KEN.</p>
<h1>VIX and McDICK</h1>
<p>In <a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/14112014-Equities-Most-shorted-of-the-week.html">May 2014</a> (circled within the first blue ball), GME short interest was noted to be markedly increased from \~18% to 26%.</p>

<p><a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/25112014-Equities-Retailers-on-short-seller-holiday-list.html">This value</a> increased from \~25% to 32% in July.</p>

<p>Per the SEC quarterly filing, McDICK entered around the 2nd blue ball.</p>

<p>Here is even the call and put volume of by year to show the number of marriages going on:</p>

<p>From the OBV, it doesn’t really look like it’s retail. The OBV (blue) pretty fucking much remained the same (if not trended a wee bit up) while the share price (black) dropped like hot sauce. Looks a lot like what we’ve been seeing now while we have been holding it in and prairie dogging it until we hit MOASS.</p>

<p>So…. Like WTF happened in 2019?</p>
<p><a href="https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-declares-quarterly-cash-dividend-announces-intent">The numbers of shares dropped by a shit ton</a>. This is why we see a drastic dip in the OBV that was presented in the beginning.</p>
