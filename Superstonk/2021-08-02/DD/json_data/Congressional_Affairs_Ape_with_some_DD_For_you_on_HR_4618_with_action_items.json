    "selftext": " Hi Apes, Apettes, Non-Binary Apes, and All apes in between \u2013 Congressional Affairs Ape here! I am so excited that I can finally use my skills to do some proper DD. We have finally ventured into my field, so without further ado, let\u2019s get into the actions that Congress is taking.\u00a0 \n\nMy normal portfolio is natural resources, but I am more than happy to lend my expertise regarding all things congress.\u00a0 \n\nTL; DR:\n\n1) If this bill were to become law, Bullish AF, with an exciting new date to hype (180 days from passage).\n\n2) The path for this bill to become law is long and hard, but not impossible. \n\n3) If you want this bill to become law there are specific and clear things to do, right now in the full post.\n\n\n[H.R. 4618 Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4618?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22short+sale%22%5D%7D&amp;amp;amp;s=1&amp;amp;amp;r=1) \n\nFirst up is the bill status. This bill was just debated, marked up, and voted out of committee by the House Committee on Financial Services.\u00a0 \n\n[Here\u2019s a link to the markup](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408113) if you want to see it, the committee was fairly busy that day.\u00a0 \n\n[This link is the current status of the bill itself](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bills-117-4618-w000187-amdt-8.pdf). During the markup the Committee did something typical which is to adopt an amendment in the nature of a substitute. They post it to the committee website because Congres.gov (run by Congressional Research Service) can be significantly slow. Bottom line, this is your most up-to-date bill text.\u00a0 \n\n[This is the current law](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section78m&amp;amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;amp;edition=prelim) (to which this bill amends). There are a lot of places to get this but I prefer the US Code Website.\u00a0 \n\nThe law has four sections. The first two modify existing law, and the second two take new actions.\u00a0 \n\nBelow is my own original work to superimpose the amendment on the law (deleted text is ~~strikethrough~~ amendment text is *italics*). The first two sections of the law modify the code. I\u2019m skipping you down to the relevant sections, covering Section 1 and 2. Please note that the bill strike text and the US code are slightly different, this sadly is normal and the House Law Revision Council does not always codify everything so perfectly. Don't sweat it, I believe this is a good representation of what H.R. 4618 does. If you are wondering what that means, it's that Congress passes laws real fast but is slow to modify the \"books\" so sometimes the law text is not updated in a timely way. Think of it as a full employment practice for people like me to step in and do this kind of work. Your welcome.\n\n**\u00a778m. Periodical and other reports** \n\n**(f) Reports by institutional investment managers** \n\n(1) Every institutional investment manager which uses the mails, or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in the course of its business as an institutional investment manager and which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding ~~equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1) or otherwise becomes or is deemed to become a beneficial owner of any security of a class described in subsection (d)(1) upon the purchase or sale of a security-based swap that the Commission may define by rule, having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000 or such lesser amount (but in no case less than $10,000,000) as the Commission, by rule, may determine, shall file reports with the Commission in such form, for such periods, and at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one year or shorter than one quarter.~~ *covered securities having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding twelve months of at least $100,000,000, shall file reports at such times after the end of such periods as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, but in no event shall such reports be filed for periods longer than one quarter or shorter than one month*.\u00a0\u00a0Such reports shall include for each ~~such equity\u00a0security~~ *covered security*\u00a0held on the last day of the reporting period by accounts (in aggregate or by type as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe) with respect to which the institutional investment manager exercises investment discretion (other than securities held in amounts which the Commission, by rule, determines to be insignificant for purposes of this subsection), the name of the issuer and the title, class, CUSIP number, number of shares or principal amount, and aggregate fair market value of each such security. Such reports may also include for accounts (in aggregate or by type) with respect to which the institutional investment manager exercises investment discretion such of the following information as the Commission, by rule, prescribes- \n\n(A) the name of the issuer and the title, class, CUSIP number, number of shares or principal amount, and aggregate fair market value or cost or amortized cost of each other security (other than an exempted security) held on the last day of the reporting period by such accounts; \n\n(B) the aggregate fair market value or cost or amortized cost of exempted securities (in aggregate or by class) held on the last day of the reporting period by such accounts; \n\n(C) the number of shares of each equity security of a class described in subsection (d)(1) held on the last day of the reporting period by such accounts with respect to which the institutional investment manager possesses sole or shared authority to exercise the voting rights evidenced by such securities; \n\n(D) the aggregate purchases and aggregate sales during the reporting period of each security (other than an exempted security) effected by or for such accounts; and \n\n(E) with respect to any transaction or series of transactions having a market value of at least $500,000 or such other amount as the Commission, by rule, may determine, effected during the reporting period by or for such accounts in any equity security of a class described in subsection (d)(1)- \n\n(i) the name of the issuer and the title, class, and CUSIP number of the security; \n\n(ii) the number of shares or principal amount of the security involved in the transaction; \n\n(iii) whether the transaction was a purchase or sale; \n\n(iv) the per share price or prices at which the transaction was effected; \n\n(v) the date or dates of the transaction; \n\n(vi) the date or dates of the settlement of the transaction; \n\n(vii) the broker or dealer through whom the transaction was effected; \n\n(viii) the market or markets in which the transaction was effected; and \n\n(ix) such other related information as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe. \n\n(2) The Commission shall prescribe rules providing for the public disclosure of the name of the issuer and the title, class, CUSIP number, aggregate amount of the number of short sales of each security, and any additional information determined by the Commission following the end of the reporting period. At a minimum, such public disclosure shall occur every month. \n\n(3) The Commission, by rule, or order, may exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, any institutional investment manager or security or any class of institutional investment managers or securities from any or all of the provisions of this subsection or the rules thereunder. \n\n(4) The Commission shall make available to the public for a reasonable fee a list of all equity securities of a class described in subsection (d)(1), updated no less frequently than reports are required to be filed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Commission shall tabulate the information contained in any report filed pursuant to this subsection in a manner which will, in the view of the Commission, maximize the usefulness of the information to other Federal and State authorities and the public. Promptly after the filing of any such report, the Commission shall make the information contained therein conveniently available to the public for a reasonable fee in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe, except that the Commission, as it determines to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, may delay or prevent public disclosure of any such information in accordance with\u00a0section 552 of title 5. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any such information identifying the securities held by the account of a natural person or an estate or trust (other than a business trust or investment company) shall not be disclosed to the public. \n\n(5) In exercising its authority under this subsection, the Commission shall determine (and so state) that its action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors or to maintain fair and orderly markets or, in granting an exemption, that its action is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of this subsection. In exercising such authority the Commission shall take such steps as are within its power, including consulting with the Comptroller General of the United States, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the appropriate regulatory agencies, Federal and State authorities which, directly or indirectly, require reports from institutional investment managers of information substantially similar to that called for by this subsection, national securities exchanges, and registered securities associations, (A) to achieve uniform, centralized reporting of information concerning the securities holdings of and transactions by or for accounts with respect to which institutional investment managers exercise investment discretion, and (B) consistently with the objective set forth in the preceding subparagraph, to avoid unnecessarily duplicative reporting by, and minimize the compliance burden on, institutional investment managers. Federal authorities which, directly or indirectly, require reports from institutional investment managers of information substantially similar to that called for by this subsection shall cooperate with the Commission in the performance of its responsibilities under the preceding sentence. An institutional investment manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \\[12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.\\], shall file with the appropriate regulatory agency a copy of every report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection. \n\n(6)(A) For purposes of this subsection the term \"institutional investment manager\" includes any person, other than a natural person, investing in or buying and selling securities for its own account, and any person exercising investment discretion with respect to the account of any other person. \n\n(B) The Commission shall adopt such rules as it deems necessary or appropriate to prevent duplicative reporting pursuant to this subsection by two or more institutional investment managers exercising investment discretion with respect to the same amount.[2](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section78m&amp;amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;amp;edition=prelim#78m_2_target) \n\n*(7) Form of Reports.--The Commission may prescribe by rule the form of the reports required under paragraph (1).*\u00a0 \n\n*(8) Covered Security.--For the purposes of paragraph (1) the term \u2018covered security\u2019 means--* \n\n*(A) an equity security of a class described in subsection (d)(1); or* \n\n*(B) a direct or indirect derivative interest or position (including security-based swap) in an equity security, as defined by the Commission.* \n\nSection 3 of the law states that after 180 days of the enactment of the Act, the SEC has to implement rules made by Section 929X of title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act.\u00a0 \n\n[Section 929x is on page 496 of this doc](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/pdf/PLAW-111publ203.pdf) (the enrolled public law). This puts a statutory requirement for the SEC to promulgate rules to actually enforce this part of the law.\u00a0 \n\nSection 4 of the law states that the SEC shall conduct a study to evaluate the standards and criteria to determine how confidential treatment shall apply to 13(f) filings, and a year after this Act is passed into law, they have to submit a report to the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Further, the SEC has 2 years to revise and issue rules to consistent with the findings of the study.\u00a0 \n\n**Analysis:** \n\nSection 1 and 2 are important for a number of reasons, but particularly because they broaden the definition of the type of security product covered here. A financial institution can\u2019t claim \u201coh this financial product isn\u2019t covered by the law.\u201d Basically all financial products would now be covered by the reporting law. If this were to become law, bullish AF. \n\nSection 3 is far and away the most important because if passed into law (which we are a LONG time away from), the SEC would actually have to enforce the law within 180 days (new potential hype date alert) from enactment with respect to the illegal practice of naked short selling or otherwise fabricating shares of stock. The original law did not have any time frame so if the SEC did not prioritize issuing those rules, well it just didn't get done. I know it sucks, but that\u2019s kind of how it is. Shit like this changes a lot as administrations change, different priorities are set, ect.\u00a0I\u2019m of the camp that the SEC is doing as good a job as it can do with the resources it has. My agency certainly operates this way. It is what it is. If this were to become law, bullish AF. \n\nSection 4 requires the SEC to take a hard look at 13(f) filings, and look at the discretionary practice (or should there be), and then make rules to codify their report findings. This would give the administration writing the report an outsized influence on the outcome here, and the timeline is inside the current administration (before the next presidential election). My analysis is that were this to become law, the SEC would probably do something to daylight the 13(f) reports or to maybe publish them in a more open and transparent way after a period of confidentiality, or something along those lines. This is a long term thing (2+ years). If this were to become law, I remain, Bullish AF. \n\n**Concluding thoughts:** \n\nThis seems like a good law, that\u2019s reasonably bipartisan. This law would definitely lower the boom on short selling and look at daylighting some other financial practices that potentially cause consumer harm.\u00a0 \n\nHowever, there is a long ass road before this bill becomes a law. Here\u2019s what we have left: \n\n* The House Committee on Rules would need to write a rule for the floor debate of H.R. 4618, which if it has support of the Rules Committee (a proxy for the speaker these days, this was not always the case, but it is now), then the bill would have a time, place, and manner for debate. This would also set up if there would be any additional amendments considered on the bill.\u00a0 \n* Floor debate / floor vote. Realistically, if the House majority puts this on the floor, this will probably pass the house. It\u2019s either bipartisan enough to go forward or the majority has the votes. If this does not have bipartisan support, it is almost certainly DOA on the Senate floor.\u00a0 \n* The bill is transmitted to the United States Senate. \n* The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee would need to consider the bill and either report it favorably, or a split vote (in the 50-50 Senate), there would need to\u00a0 be a discharge petition to get the tie vote to the floor. \n* The Majority Leader of the Senate, who has the power over the calendar would have to schedule a vote on Cloture, which is a 60 vote threshold, to begin a period of 30 hours of debate. Prior to the invocation of cloture, debate is considered Unlimited in the Senate. This is the filibuster hurdle that you may have heard something about in the news. If this was a bipartisan vote in the house, there is a possibility that the Senate moves to consider the bill and debate it on the floor.\u00a0 \n* Debate time expires and a floor vote is held. 51 votes are needed to pass. Again in the 50-50 Senate, the Vice President serves as the President of the Senate and could cast a tie breaking vote. This is also a proxy for the administration position (the vice president would not be likely to vote to pass a bill that the President would veto). \n* If the identical bill is adopted by the Senate, the bill goes to the President for their Signature or Veto. \n* If the bill is not identical (and I mean to the punctuation mark), it goes back to the House of Representatives where it either goes back to Committee or the Rules Committee steps in with a new rule to get it to the floor for consideration. When both the House and Senate have passed identical bills that is sent to the President for their signature or veto. \n\nIf this bill has hope it needs citizens calling their Members of Congress to tell them to support it, this need to be bipartisan, by a huge margin. Make it clear that 80-90% of Americans support this law.\u00a0 \n\n**Action Items:** \n\n1) [Call the House Committee on Rules](https://rules.house.gov/) and ask them to: \n\nA) Set a rule for debate. Recommend a closed rule so that additional amendments cannot be offered.\u00a0 \n\nB) Approve the Rule. \n\nC) The Committee Chair is [Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA-02)](https://mcgovern.house.gov/) 202-225-6101 and the Ranking Member is [Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK-04)](https://cole.house.gov/) 202-225-6165. These two members of the House of Representatives collectively control what is debated, the manner in which it is debated, and for how long. The rules committee is very important. When you reach out to these lawmakers be extremely nice. Give them the ability to be bipartisan and work together this is deeply not a partisan issue.\n\n2) Call your Member of Congress, whoever they are, and ask them to support this bill.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n3) Call your Senators and ask them to support this bill (once it passes the House). \n\n[Find your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) \n\n[Find your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm) \n\nTips when talking to members or there staff: \n\n* Be extremely polite \n* Be totally happy to talk to staff or leave a message \n* Do write a letter or send an email or a fax \n* Don\u2019t expect to talk directly to a legislator \n* Don\u2019t call anyone a jerk \n* Simply let them know that this bill (H.R. 4618) is important to you, why it\u2019s important, and keep it simple. It\u2019s illegal to make 100 copies of your car title and try to sell your car 100 times \u2013 this practice should be outlawed when it comes to stocks as well. Simple. The better you can articulate it, the easier it is for them to support. Members of Congress by and large are against crime, and they should support this bill because it would take meaningful action to suppress crime. Especially white collar crime.\u00a0 \n* Don\u2019t talk about individual securities (like one particular class A stock that we all LOVE). But do get into the issue at hand. Naked short selling is a practice that is criminal and strikes at the heart of confidence in our financial system. People need to be confident in American markets, and this bill makes people more confident.\u00a0 \n* Do plan a day of action with your fellow apes to be good advocates for the bill. Like tomorrow! Are your tits jacked? Call your member of Congress.\u00a0 \n* Do, write paper letters. Do light up the phones. Do the things to get the attention of the decision makers in Washington to make this happen. It actually works when you do this.\u00a0 \n* Do, understand that collective action for a law has nothing to do with your interest and support of any particular security you may or may not be hodling.\u00a0 \n* DO be super super super polite. Nobody will give a hoot about what you have to say if you\u2019re a jerk.\u00a0 \n* DO ask me questions about congress or the process I will do my best to answer them.",
