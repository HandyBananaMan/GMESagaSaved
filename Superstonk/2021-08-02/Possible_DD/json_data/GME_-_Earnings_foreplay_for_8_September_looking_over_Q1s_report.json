This is part of the reason why so many of us REALLY FUCKING LIKE GME](https://preview.redd.it/ef9fgz654we71.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=81e3d602b14318f4168d280be40b5b9ad3feeb24)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeptember 8 is the announced date for the Q2 earnings report.  What are the expectations for Q2?\n\n***Consensus:\u00a0 $0.41 EPS***\n\n***Revenue:\u00a0 $1.07 Bil***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow did the previous earnings go? Why is GME getting so good fundamentally that the earnings look like a fucking giant green dildo getting lubed up?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Net Sales Grew 25% to $1.3 Billion\n\nEarnings blew last year out of the water. And we see an increase in all cash flows across the board, with a lot going from \"investing activities\". Basically, setting GME up to be a new monolith for the 2020s. This happened in Q1, while the consumer base and operations was still setting up basically. It's probably still in development, but it would be fair to expect it to be EVEN BETTER than Q1.\n\n[Literally no reason NOT to be extremely bullish.](https://preview.redd.it/b8o6e9r97we71.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=5309ae5d7a49b463bf9b84f4ee5b1ef64152a779)\n\nOh and did you notice? They are paying their debt too!  As of May 1, 2021, the Company had $770.8 million in cash and restricted cash, compared to $583.9 million in cash and restricted cash in the prior year. The Company had no borrowings under its asset-based revolving credit facility and no long-term debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Q1 Losses?? What the fuck is a loss?\n\nLower net losses over 2020 and a SIGNIFICANT increase in transformation costs! You know, the thing Ryan Cohen said he'd do? Well, seems that actions speak louder than words and that's why it's been so silent.\n\n[Literally every single losses from 2020 has been EXPONENTIALLY reduced. This is almost fucking unprecedented. Almost 5x reduction in operating and net losses over JUST one year. ](https://preview.redd.it/e1o6kvw46we71.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=691a442430208cdc2df100cca73b818de8b81ce8)\n\n\\*SG&A means: selling, general and administrative expenses\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Highlights\n\n* Net sales increased 25.1% to $1.277 billion, compared to $1.021 billion in the fiscal 2020 first quarter, overcoming a nearly 12% reduction in the Company\u2019s global store base due to strategic de-densification efforts, and continued store closures across Europe due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n* Gross margin was 25.9%, a decline of 180 basis points compared to the fiscal 2020 first quarter;\n* Reported selling, general and administrative expenses were $370.3 million, a decline of $16.2 million, or 4.2%, from $386.5 million in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. Adjusted for severance, transformation and other costs, selling, general and administrative expenses were $351.7 million, a decline of $29.5 million, or 7.7%, from $381.2 million in the fiscal 2020 first quarter;\n* Operating loss of ($40.8) million compared to ($108.0) million in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. Adjusted operating loss of ($21.6) million compared to ($98.8) million in the fiscal 2020 first quarter;\n* Net loss of ($66.8) million, or ($1.01) per diluted share as compared to net loss of ($165.7) million, or ($2.57) per diluted share, in the fiscal 2020 first quarter. Adjusted net loss of ($29.4) million or ($0.45) per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of ($157.6) million or ($2.44) per diluted share in the fiscal 2020 first quarter;\n* Adjusted EBITDA of ($0.7) million compared to ($75.5) million in the fiscal 2020 first quarter, and;\n* Income tax expense was $1.3 million compared to income tax expense of $50.4 million in the fiscal 2020 first quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMention from the retarded OP: All this is basically from [https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/gme](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/gme)\n\nTried to condense and put out all the stuff I found interesting and relevant going forward. Flair is possible DD since I don't see this as a real DD, especially if compared to the other real ones. This is just a small FYI.\n\nOh and if anything is wrong, point it our and I'll correct it (or add if there's anything interesting to be added)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nQ1 was amazing. Q2 MIGHT be better, but I don't give a fuck. Fundamentally it's bomb proof and that is the SMALLEST reason why I like the fucking STOCK. No hypes, no dates. Sit back and just enjoy the ride.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEuropoor here but I really do try to buy more. If you think you don't matter, you do. Even with .X, X, or XX shares. Brick by brick we're owning the stock and the numbers are on our side.",
