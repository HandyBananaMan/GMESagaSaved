    "selftext": "Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes around the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nAfter the $1 trillion RRP on Friday, the United States Congress failing to extend the eviction moratorium, and finally the ongoing meltdown of Evergrande in China, things seem very primed for volatility, which just might be the catalyst that ignites the MOASS. I know we're all eagerly HODLing with our Diamantenh\u00e4nde, and many Apes are beginning to wonder just how long this is going to take. Worry not - the DD is solid, the short interest is astronomical, and the short hedge funds are desperate. DTCC rules are in place, the SEC seems to be coming out to play, and there are several scapegoats to pin the global economic collapse on. The time is coming, and I, for one, am proud to stand before you and call myself an Ape. **Ook - ook**.\n\nToday marks a new week, and starts a new month. Today is August 2nd, and you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 120 minutes in: **$159.68 / 135,23 \u20ac**  *(volume: 4212)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 115 minutes in: $159.11 / 134,75 \u20ac  *(volume: 4181)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 110 minutes in: $160.96 / 136,31 \u20ac  *(volume: 4074)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 105 minutes in: $159.84 / 135,36 \u20ac  *(volume: 4069)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 100 minutes in: $160.27 / 135,73 \u20ac  *(volume: 3999)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 95 minutes in: $160.78 / 136,16 \u20ac  *(volume: 3650)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 90 minutes in: $159.10 / 134,74 \u20ac  *(volume: 3572)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 85 minutes in: $158.85 / 134,53 \u20ac  *(volume: 3539)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 80 minutes in: $159.11 / 134,75 \u20ac  *(volume: 2473)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 75 minutes in: $160.06 / 135,55 \u20ac  *(volume: 1774)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 70 minutes in: $160.01 / 135,51 \u20ac  *(volume: 1677)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 65 minutes in: $160.10 / 135,59 \u20ac  *(volume: 1553)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 60 minutes in: $160.07 / 135,56 \u20ac  *(volume: 1510)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 55 minutes in: $160.16 / 135,64 \u20ac  *(volume: 1480)*\r\n- \u2b1c 50 minutes in: $160.56 / 135,97 \u20ac  *(volume: 1346)*\r\n- \u2b1c 45 minutes in: $160.56 / 135,97 \u20ac  *(volume: 1311)*\r\n- \u2b1c 40 minutes in: $160.56 / 135,97 \u20ac  *(volume: 1263)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 35 minutes in: $160.56 / 135,97 \u20ac  *(volume: 1187)*\r\n- \u2b1c 30 minutes in: $160.53 / 135,95 \u20ac  *(volume: 1134)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 25 minutes in: $160.53 / 135,95 \u20ac  *(volume: 1114)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 20 minutes in: $160.46 / 135,89 \u20ac  *(volume: 768)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 15 minutes in: $160.44 / 135,88 \u20ac  *(volume: 738)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 10 minutes in: $160.74 / 136,12 \u20ac  *(volume: 371)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 5 minutes in: $160.72 / 136,11 \u20ac  *(volume: 367)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 0 minutes in: $160.89 / 136,25 \u20ac  *(volume: 0)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 US close price: $161.12 / 136,45 \u20ac   *($161.00 / 136,35 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD.
