<p><strong>Mod Team Updates -</strong> We have some exciting changes coming to the moderator team!</p>
<p>First, I am extremely glad to bring you the good news that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Sharkbaitlol/">u/Sharkbaitlol</a> has decided to return to the mod team! Shark was an extremely valued member of the team, so to have him return is a huge boon for the community and mod team alike. Next, we have two <em>new</em> mods joining our ranks alongside Shark's return, please welcome:</p>
<p>u/Chared945<a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Doom_Douche/">u/Doom_Douche</a></p>
<p>We are pleased that these Apes all decided to join our team. I will speak for the mod team when I say that we are all excited to work alongside these three new members. You will be seeing them around the sub, so feel free to say hi! ðŸ‘‹ Also, please go easy on them as they learn the ropes, everyone starts somewhere. There is always a potential that mistakes can be made, so be patient if that happens to be the case</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Karma Requirements -</strong> As many of you know our sub's Karma requirements are quite strict; too Strict, many would say. The team has been discussing the best course of action here and we have come to the conclusion that we need to lower it some. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Jsmar18">u/Jsmar18</a>, (who is a Data ~~scientist~~ wizard), put together some graphs to show us the Karma breakdown of our members as it relates to the Karma req's we have implemented.</p>
<p>After much thought, we have decided to lower the Karma requirements only a small amount for now to reduce the risk that may exist by allowing more accounts through. <strong>The new submission requirements are as follows:</strong></p>
<p>Posts: 6000 Karma / 240 Days | Comments: 1500 Karma / 120 Days</p>

<p>"TLDR: There is a lot of DD, a lot of speculation, amazing theories on reddit and for the newer apes this is the data that will confirm a lot of it for you. You'll be able to see what holders from 2020 or early 2021 have experienced and why these holders like myself are so zen. Hedgies haven't covered/closed they are fucked. Apes set high scores."</p>

<p>"Keep Strong. Apes are right. You are sitting on a winning lotto ticket. The numbers have been drawn and you won..... Now everyone is trying to convince you that you didn't; just so you don't collect your winnings. They are throwing every obstacle in your way but you hold that winning ticket. The price of the stock and their manipulation can only last so long.......and at the end of the day if you held.... you will change your family's life!"</p>
