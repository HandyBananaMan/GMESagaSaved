<p><strong>TL.DR: It seems like those fuckers are hiding (covering but not closing) the synthetics, then shorting the ETF that holds the puts hiding the synthetics. (Thanks to YT user Blackchain).</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: If there's any info to be corrected, Charlie will post a video on &gt;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CharliesVids/videos">his page</a>&lt;. Even if that's not the case, I would still totally recommend his channel, as its pretty much unique as to the info he digs.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Added another link to another mindblowing video.</p>
<p>Edit 3: <strong>It’s put contracts but it’s in the IWM ETF not GME</strong> (thank you u/squidja) - Take a look at the weight of GME over this ETF and the % shorted</p>
<p>Edit 4: Changed the first photo to better reflect the idea of the video.</p>
