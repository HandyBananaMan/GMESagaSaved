**TL.DR: It seems like those fuckers are hiding (covering but not closing) the synthetics, then shorting the ETF that holds the puts hiding the synthetics. (Thanks to YT user Blackchain).**

**~~^((We have turned off our share lending, so they are resorting to ETFs)~~****\*\*\*\*****~~)~~**

Point 1: [Almost 575 MILLION puts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi1Qfql3mCw) for IWM is the number Charlie could find.

Point 2: [ETF Manipulation IS A COUNTER TO SHARE LENDING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0_a8C9lvOo)

&#x200B;

Point 3: [Further proof that this is “all one giant share lending mess”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYs2ZPijdHw)

&#x200B;

Point 4: [Give a look at the MSCI ESG score for iShares ETF (aka DOGSHIT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQezP2PfJrM)

&#x200B;

Point 5: IF YOU HAVEN'T TURNED OFF YOUR SHARE LENDING OPTION, THE TIME IS NOW =)

END GAME MUCH?

&#x200B;

RULES BEING ENFORCED? DON'T THINK SO

&#x200B;

INSIDER TRADING, FRAUD, COLLUSION FOR COLLAPSE AND MAYO SHORTING

&#x200B;

WHAT THE FUCK FOLKS,

WHAT THE FUCK.

EDIT: If there's any info to be corrected, Charlie will post a video on >[his page](https://www.youtube.com/c/CharliesVids/videos)<. Even if that's not the case, I would still totally recommend his channel, as its pretty much unique as to the info he digs.

Edit 2: Added another link to another mindblowing video.

Edit 3: **It’s put contracts but it’s in the IWM ETF not GME** (thank you u/squidja) - Take a look at the weight of GME over this ETF and the % shorted

Edit 4: Changed the first photo to better reflect the idea of the video.
