<p>Please remember that GameStop is sitting on almost a couple billion of cash on hand, if the price is dropping from Hedgie action, or there is some sort of sell off going on by an institution (doubt it, but if so fuck them anyways), GME will announce a share buyback in order to return value to shareholders and executive team, thus reducing the float and putting even more pressure on shorts.</p>
<p>Price goes down to a $100? GME could buy the 5mil shares they just sold with half their raised cash. that's almost 10% of the float out of circulation.</p>
<p>Scared GME is going to go back to $20 where a lot of analysts are putting it at? GME can remove 40% off the float with half the cash they just raised. This would almost double the reported short interest. (This, of course, would not happen as the stock is very illiquid as it is and any large purchase can send this to the moon.)</p>
<p>Not only would apes buy the dip, but so will the company if they see that their share price is undervalued.</p>
<p>If you believe in the future of this company, know that no amount of fuckery from SHFs will prevent the company from doing what's best for the company and the shareholders. They can't. Its all a mind game from now until they close their positions, we know it, they know it, RC knows it.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
