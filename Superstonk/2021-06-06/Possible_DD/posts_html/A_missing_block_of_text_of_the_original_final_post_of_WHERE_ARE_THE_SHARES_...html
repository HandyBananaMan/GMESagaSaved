<p>I left the original DD "WHERE ARE THE SHARES?? A Beginner's Guide to Hiding 100 Million FTDs - (FINAL)" by u/leavemeanon open because I wanted to read it later, but then I forgot about it and then it was deleted, but my browser was still opened on that page.</p>
<p>Thankfully, u/VoxUmbra could recover it and posted the whole DD here (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_1/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_1/</a>) (Thanks for that!)</p>

<p>Because I was curious I just used a text difference tool to check if the two final posts were actually equal, and found out that <strong>the original author,</strong> u/leavemeanon <strong>probably made a few more changes that were NOT archived AFTER the post was up.</strong> Most of them were insignificant, but one part was a giant block of text  that was added above the <strong>Gamestop, for real this time</strong> title.</p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> u/VoxUmbra <strong><em>99.99% SURE DID</em></strong> <strong>NOT</strong> <strong><em>EDIT THAT PART OUT. MOST LIKELY, THE POST WAS ARCHIVED</em></strong> <strong>BEFORE</strong> <strong><em>THE EDIT WAS MADE.</em></strong></p>

<p>You should skim through that IWM  prospectus. Especially the 'Creation and Redemption' section. Again,  creation/redemption isn't a "one-for-one", <em>all or nothing</em> process - AP deposits some pile of [assets and cash], and ETF issuer provides [50,000 ETF shares OR 50,000 underlying shares.]</p>
<p>And,  obviously, no physical shares are being exchanged - it's all data.  Specifically, the ETF issuer treats the deposits as "redemption  credits", basically looking at the 'asset/cash' pile and saying - <em>can't tell if that's ETF or underlying, so we'll just say it's both</em>. So if the AP prefers the underlying (to meet demand there), ETF issuer returns so called <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2017/34-82193.pdf"><strong>"redemption credits"</strong></a> for the asset/cash deposit, <strong>and these trade just like real shares.</strong></p>
<p>Why  doesn't the ETF just use the shares it owns? Well maybe because  redemption credits are written against taxes, but probably because the  fund already lent all of its real shares. A couple times. Each. That's  what they do.</p>
<p>and these "redemption credits" are used <strong>cumulatively</strong>  for tax write-offs, so they are tracked somehow. Not reported of  course, and there's a little blurb in the IWM prospectus that says  something like "we've elected to not adopt an automated regulation  system for the creation/redemption deposits..."</p>
<p>so  the only intermediaries between infinite derivative/cash deposits and  infinite liquidity is 1) the algo's ability to find a synthetic that's  cheaper than the shares (arbitrage) within 3 days (or 6 or 35...) and 2)  the custodian's stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Who's that custodian? <strong>State Street.</strong> Seriously. I felt like someone was just messing with me when I read all this.</p>

<p>If anyone wants proof, I just used the Firefox "Download page" feature to download the whole final part of the DD and got it saved.</p>

<p>u/VoxUmbra you might want to consider adding this to your recovery post of the original DD.</p>
