Daily there are multiple reposts, the guy is a legend and I see everyone of them get 4K+ upvotes. While I love reliving the badass comments he has made, reposting his final update and reposting his comments about “I bought more” or “what’s an exit strategy” could be misused by folks karma farming to seem more legit. 

Just an Ape’s opinion.
