So before the weekend CNBC aired naked shorts. Whilst they could have cut to another camera or ads etc or just left the camera on the dude they went to a long shot of this woman with a memeable face. And it was memed. 

Now Murdoch's fox is interviewing 'one of us'. The rest of the media are following up with stories. 

These are the same media who wouldn't mention gme a month ago. Ignored it rising, shouted about the dips. Not once have they been on our side and they never will be. Billionaire owned, billionaire run. Billionaires narrative. 

They know we don't trust them, they've tried every trick and we did not falter. Now they're trying to gain trust, spinning a little of the narrative we love. It's blown up. They're going to spin this against us. They will run the naked line until midweek and then they'll have investigations that find no naked shorts. Counter DD and more FUD to pick off paper apes. 

(Edit: meant to say here about spinning naked narrative on other tickers, but the wrinkle smoothed out. ... Why do you think you're seeing lists of 50 tickers that BANKS have banned shorting on. I've never the fuck heard of half of them... FUD. Repeat after me. ONLY GME. HODL)

I have seen posts and comments talking about the woman, how she's secretly a hodlr and one of us. Because she tweeted something by dfv and said meow. Wow 1 fucking retweet and suddenly the face of the biggest FUD machine is an ape? The fuck she is. It was an act, and you're buying into it.  

Do not believe them. Do not trust them even when they tell the truth. They're the fucking wolves, and they're putting on their lambskin Clara to trick you. 

Not financial advice. I just hodl, wait and eat crayons.
