Probably all of us. we need to work on our branding. Once we get better branding we get more people understanding our movement and this will put the political pressures for legislation reform. I want to hear this issue being addressed by the President of the United States\n\nif occupy Wall Street protests and the 2008 crisis wasn\u2019t enough to get the reform we needed in place we\u2019re gonna need better branding and more public face speaker heads for this movement. \n\nIf the SEC makes money every time these hedge funds commit crimes instead of making them serve jail time they are corrupt. The SEC shouldn\u2019t be incentives to make money off fines, they should be held accountable for fairness and law and order. The SEC isn\u2019t blind to these issues, they profit off them.\n\nThe DTCC cannot be a self regulated  institution. No foxes allowed in the henhouse\n\nWe need to work on branding!\n\nEdit: movement stocks are also a good name\n\nEdit2: wanna make it clear not fin advice, I personal just like the stock, that being said, if you own GME or not their is a systemic issue.",
    "title": "Stop calling them \u201cmeme\u201d stocks. They are momentum stocks. When the media calls them \u201cmeme stocks\u201d it comes with a negative connotation and the average folk take it for just that.. a meme. We are a movement for financial reform. Let\u2019s get better at our branding to get the legislative reform we need",
