I'm not a writer, so I always have trouble on where to start. A major historic story is being written and we are living in it. There is so much more to this ongoing story than a bunch of smooth brained apes going to the moon and receiving life changing money.  I am in it for the life changing money, but it isn’t the money that motivates me, it is all the good I am going to be able to do that inspires me to Buy, Hodl and I voted!

I want to start with the two main characters of this story, Ryan Cohen and Keith Gill. What really inspires me to be part of this whole story is the character of these two gentlemen. My job for 30 years has been to “read” people.  I do not know either of them personally, I only know them through their actions and words. So, I take all the information I have been supplied: Letter to the board, interviews on TV, tweets, reddit posts, blogs, past actions (chewy customer service), YouTube channel, etc. and try to determine what type of person they are. This is done through actions, watching body language, facial expression, eye movement and probably most important their speech (tone and inflictions).  Through many years of studying this information you are able to get a pretty good idea of the person you are dealing with. In my opinion we are dealing with two very humble, sincere, kind individuals who care more about others than themselves.

Why does this matter? I will get to that in a little bit. We need some more background first.

When I am hiring someone (I hire about 3-4 new employees a year) one of the questions I ask in the interview is “what motivates you to get out of bed to go to work?”. 9 times out of 10 the answer is money. I then press them farther because money is not a motivator. Money is just a green piece of paper. You don’t jump out of bed every weekday morning for the opportunity to go home with some green paper. What motivates you is what money can do for you.  Does it provide: family, travel, sports, cars, food, prestige and fame? These are the things that motivate an individual.

Prestige and fame - most individuals would love to have their names written in the history books, to live on beyond their mortal life.  And not just some obscure history book, but the majority of the world knows you by name. So how do you get your name in neon lights forever? Written in history that stands up to the test of time!   Ever heard of Mansa Musa? Ever heard of Koroibos of Elis? Didn’t think so. Who are these individuals? One was the richest man in history and the other was the first ever Olympian. What this shows is that over time, riches and stardom are things that fade and do not hold up to time. 

The names that hold up are those that have made significant changes to the world. Ever hear of Spartacus, Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Voltaire, Sir Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, Plato? These are all individuals that made significant changes to human kind without being leaders of countries or spiritual leaders. 

I believe this is Ryan Cohen and Keith Gill’s Legacy.  It is not the millions or billions of dollars they will make. It will be the impact they have on our world.  I do not believe either of them thought 6 months ago they could have imagined they would impact the world in such a significant way. I do believe sometime in the last 6 months they realized the opportunity they had to change the world. They are seizing on that opportunity not for want of money, fame or prestige, but for the opportunity to make our world a better place. 

How many stories have we heard of all the good that has already been done and all the good that is going to be done? Saving the gorillas, saving the oceans, changing our financial systems? Personally, I will be starting a charity to help less fortunate children. This is history being written that will stand the test of time. This is their legacy.  

Personally, I want to thank them both for understanding the potential and being the catalyst for all the good that is going to come from this. This is not hero worship or putting any individual on a pedestal.  This is just giving appreciation for those that deserve it.  We need more people in the world like this!

TLDR: Ryan Cohen and Keith Gill’s legacy is being written and it isn’t about money, prestige or fame. It is about changing the world to be a better place.

P.S. Thanks for everyone that contributes, especially the in-depth DD. I have no idea how you all have so much time and write so much. This little piece took this smooth brained ape forever to write!!
