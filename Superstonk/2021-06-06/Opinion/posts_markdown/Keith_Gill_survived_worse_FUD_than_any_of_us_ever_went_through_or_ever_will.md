FUD will continue to get worse and worse as time progresses. The shills are evolving and getting better at creating FUD that looks like a legit post. This is absolutely nothing compared to what DFV has dealt with because we now have support. He didn't have support for a very long time. 

Seriously this guy is amazing. His determination and willpower is absolutely inspiring. He did his own research and stuck with the DD instead of letting his emotions get to him. No doubt he had some sleepless nights debating in his own mind wether or not he made the right move but in the end he stuck with his own research and the deep value he saw in the stock. 

He delt with more FUD than any of us ever have or ever will in the future. I completely believe shills were targeting him even back when he first started talking about GME. But what he really had going against him was that just a small group of people saw what he saw and he had little support. Most people ripped into this guy for making what they thought was a stupid bet. He continued to post updates win or lose...

He still stuck with it and now look. He's a multi millionaire and probably gonna be one of the wealthiest people on the planet from this. This man held for so long and didn't sell a single share. He only sold half his ITM calls and most of that profit went to quadrupling his position in the common stock.  

TRUST THE DD! DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!! THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE!!! EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST SPECULATION OR FUD!!
