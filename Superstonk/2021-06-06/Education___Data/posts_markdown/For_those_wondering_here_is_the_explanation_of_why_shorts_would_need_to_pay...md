Hi everyone! The more we know, the better informed we can all be. So I thought it would be good for me to explain to anyone who may want to add an extra wrinkle why there is hype around a dividend being announced at the shareholder meeting. I’m sure you have seen the “because shorts need to pay the dividend” but I am going to explain why this is the case. 

So a dividend is basically a company deciding to reward shareholders. Let’s use a cash dividend as an example. Gme could decide to issue a $x dividend per share to all share holders on a certain date. 

Now why is this bad news for the shorts? Because 99% of the SHF either have borrowed the shares they are shorting (the legal way to short) or have created the share out of thin air (naked shorting/illigal).

scenario 1: borrowed shares from institution

In this scenario they have borrowed the shares from an institution and then sold it. When a dividend is issued the institution they borrowed the shares from receives the dividend from gme. The institution does not need pay that forward to the shorter borrowing the shares, because that institution still owns the shares. The shares have just been borrowed out by the SHF. 

However! The entity or person the shorter sold the shares to is entitled to receive the dividend. They have bought a share regardless of whether it was originally borrowed or not. Because the shorter has now sold shares they don’t technically own, they are on the hook for paying the dividend to that party. 

Scenario 2: naked shorting

In this scenario the SHF has created the shares out of thin air. So obviously gme would have no record of these shares and would not pay out a dividend on shares that should not exist. So therefore the hedgies would also need to pay out the dividend here. Because the people who have bought the naked shares, are still legally owed a dividend! 


So that is why people are hyped. If a cash dividend is announced, it could mean extreme REAL losses to the hedgies. I say real because normally just like us, until they close their positions it is only a paper loss. But this dividend would be them paying out actual cash which they cannot kick down the road. They would have to pay $x dividend per share multiplied by number of shares they have shorted. That could either cause some to close out their positions or weaken them in there continued shenanigans!

It gets even more exciting when we talk about a certain potential for a gme digital currency dividend. This the hedgies cannot pay to the shareholders because it would be a unique asset held by gme. So this would be best case scenario as they would need to close out their positions because paying this dividend would not be possible without somehow obtaining the digital currency from gme. 

Conclusion: A dividend may or may not be announced! This rocket is inevitable either way. There are many more catalysts outside of this to launch the rocket. But hopefully I have helped add a wrinkle for apes to understand dividends and how they relate to the current situation a little better!

EDIT 1: so I have been asked this question a few times in the comments and wanted to address it here. I am not 100% sure on this answer as my brain is still smooth, so if I am wrong feel free to correct me apes :) 

Question: what happens when all these brokers start telling GameStop they have more shares than exists in terms of them paying out the dividend.

Answer: I do not believe that is how it works. Every real share issued by gme should have a share certificate proving that it is a real share. This plays into the posts we have seen where people wanted the actual copy of their share (with the caveat that it makes it take longer to sell). That would be the share certificate. If you had that, you would get paid directly by gme with a dividend. 

Now most of us do not have that, and it would be with our broker. So our broker on the announcement of a dividend would have to start tracking down the share certificate for the stock you own. 

So what about synthetic shares? Well your broker would say “hey, I need the share certificate for my client for that gme share I bought from you”. This would start the chain reaction of brokers calling brokers that sold them the share until it goes back to the hedgie that originally created the synthetic position. They have no one to ask so the chain stops here. So now they either need to pay the dividend forward since the share does not exist. Or buy a real share, and then provide that share certificate to your broker. That’s why For the ETF dividend, they would likely be forced to buy a share from the open market so that they can deliver that share certificate. They can’t just pay it forward! All that buying pressure would equal lift off. Hope that helps :)

EDIT 2: so another question I have been getting is who would force the SHF to provide the dividends if they refuse to. I admit I can’t really find an answer to this online so maybe wrinklier brained apes can help.

My theory would be the following. There would be so much pressure from brokers or institutions for the SHF to provide that information. They would file lawsuits and shit would literally blow up. Because our brokers are just as much on the hook to get us our shares or dividends as the SHF is to give it to them. 

Also remember that this would be fraud. It would be definitive proof that you have been sold something that does not exist. I believe the hedgies are currently conducting their fuckery knowing that it can’t currently be definitively proven, even though us apes have figured it out. However if they fail to deliver either a dividend or crypto dividend, then all of a sudden there is proof that fraud has been committed.

So I think between the pressure from other institutions and brokerages plus the proof it would provide is why they would have to either pay up or close out the position. Again though this is all opinion and maybe their are governing forces that would force them to do this. Appreciate the help of any wrinkly brained apes on this one!

EDIT 3: I have had a few comments saying that gme should not do a cash dividend as it would be bad for the company at this time. This post is mainly meant to educate apes on what role dividends play with shorting. As mentioned at the end of the post, a dividend may or may not happen. My personal opinion is I have 100% trust in Ryan Cohen and know he will do what is best for the company and therefore all us shareholders. If no dividend is announced, just know papa Cohen didn’t announce one for a reason.
