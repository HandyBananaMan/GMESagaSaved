    "selftext": "I'm a PhD researcher who uses [conversation analysis](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-conversation-analysis-ca-1689923) (CA). CA looks at everything from everyday conversations to courtroom interactions to political interviews to try to understand why we say what we say when we say it. It can shed light on things like authority, affiliation, or even the relative power of the press in a country. Seeing the [analysis of Melissa Lee's reaction by an actor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt1c6k/dont_believe_melissa_lees_shock_is_real_i_am_an/) made me realize I also actually have something to contribute for once!\n\nWe all know about the CNBC segment. I've seen a lot of people saying this is a monumental moment *just* because Lee said \"naked shorts\" live on mainstream media. In watching it again, there's more going on here.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nshffm/naked\\_shorts\\_just\\_confirmed\\_by\\_the\\_enemies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nshffm/naked_shorts_just_confirmed_by_the_enemies/)\n\nIf you listen to when Lee comes in, she's completing Seymour's sentence. This is doing a lot of different conversational work--it attempts to increase affiliation between them, speed the progression of the monologue, and assert a claim of ownership over his conclusion.\n\n[Brackets indicate overlapping speech.](https://preview.redd.it/g2owd04vfl371.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=49ad887371f640ac3c0c01ce7d18598070a69c39)\n\n More importantly, Lee reached a different conclusion than Seymour did. A key part of CA is knowledge\u2014who knows what, and how do they use it? This can turn into a rabbit-hole, because it also involves how people orient to shared knowledge. (*What does the speaker know? Does the recipient know that the speaker knows it? Does the speaker know that the recipient knows that the speaker knows it?* I'll stop there.)\n\nThe key here is that Lee treats her conclusion as obvious based on *what they* ***both*** *know.* She's not just saying the quiet part out loud, she's saying it like they all already knew it. Which, of course, is what Reddit's been saying all along.\n\nCA tends to seem like common sense once it's explained, but being able to explain that common sense is important. If you were wondering why Lee saying \"naked shorts\" was a big deal when it had clearly already been implied by Seymour, now you know: **it's not just that she said it, it's where she said it and how she said it.**",
