<p>FINRA is requesting comment on potential enhancements to its short sale reporting program.  FINRA is considering:</p>
<p>(1) modifications to its short interest reporting requirements (Rule 4560);</p>
<p>(2) a new rule to require that participants of a registered clearing agency report to FINRA information on allocations to correspondent firms of fail-to-deliver positions; and</p>
<p>(3) other potential enhancements related to short sale activity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>FINRA encourages all interested parties to comment on this request for comment. Comments must be received by August 4, 2021. </p>

<p>FINRA is considering whether amendments to its short interest reporting and dissemination program would be appropriate to improve the regulatory and public utility of the information. FINRA also is considering whether any changes to other aspects of its short sale regulatory program would be beneficial, as discussed below. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>A. Publication of Short Interest for Exchange-listed Equity Securities</strong></p>
<p>FINRA Rule 4560 requires firms to report short positions in all equity securities (other than Restricted Equity Securities) to FINRA. Thus, FINRA members are required to report short positions in both OTC equity securities and exchange-listed equity securities. However, FINRA currently only disseminates on the FINRA website short interest information for OTC equity securities. For exchange-listed securities, FINRA provides the reported short interest position information to the applicable listing exchange for processing and publication. Exchanges historically have handled the publication of short interest data for their listed securities, even after short interest reporting for all equity securities was consolidated through FINRA in 2008.<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/21-19#_edn8">8</a></p>
<p><strong>FINRA is considering consolidating the publication of short interest data that is reported to FINRA for both listed and unlisted securities.</strong> If FINRA were to make this change, short interest files for all equity securities would be made available free of charge on the FINRA website and would not require changes to firms’ reporting requirements. In addition, if this change was made, the below potential changes to the content and timing of publicly disseminated data would apply to listed and unlisted securities. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>B. Content of Short Interest Data</strong></p>
<p>FINRA receives short interest data from members on a firm-by-firm basis and subsequently aggregates the information by security to create the disseminated data files. FINRA is considering changes to the data fields firms are required to complete. </p>
<p>As discussed above, FINRA’s website publication of short interest data currently is limited to non-exchange listed, OTC equity securities and includes the following fields:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Security name</li>
<li>Symbol</li>
<li>Settlement Date</li>
<li>Market (<em>i.e.</em>, OTC equity securities)</li>
<li>Current aggregate short interest position for the security across all firms</li>
<li>Previous aggregate short interest position for the security across all firms</li>
<li>Change in short interest position since the prior reporting period (number of shares)</li>
<li>Change in short interest position since the prior reporting period (percentage)</li>
<li>Average daily trading volume for the security</li>
<li>Days to cover<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/21-19#_edn9">9</a></li>
<li>Revision Flag<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/21-19#_edn10">10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>FINRA is considering the following changes to reported and disseminated short interest data.<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/21-19#_edn11">11</a> In some cases, FINRA also is considering whether the additional data points proposed to be collected should be disseminated publicly or used only for regulatory purposes. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proprietary and Customer Account Categorization</strong>: FINRA is considering requiring firms to segregate the total reportable short interest into two categories—short interest held in proprietary accounts and short interest held in customer accounts. Specifically, in addition to reporting the total short interest in a security, firms also would be required to specify the short interest held across all proprietary accounts and across all customer accounts (for both retail customer and institutional customer accounts) for each equity security as of the close of the designated reporting settlement date. FINRA believes that this information would provide beneficial regulatory information regarding the type of market participant that accumulated a short interest position (i.e., a firm or a non-broker-dealer customer).  </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account-level Position Information:</strong> Alternatively, FINRA is considering requiring firms to report (for regulatory purposes only; not to be disseminated publicly) short interest position information with more granularity by reporting at the account level for all equity securities. Account-level short interest position information would provide FINRA with insight into the identity of the individuals or entities that accumulated concentrations of large short interest positions, which FINRA would use to enhance its reviews for compliance both with SEC Regulation SHO and FINRA’s short sale rules. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synthetic Short Positions:</strong> In addition, FINRA is considering requiring firms to reflect synthetic short positions in short interest reports. For example, enhanced short interest reporting could include <strong>synthetic short positions achieved through the sale of a call option and purchase of a put option (where the options have the same strike price and expiration month) or through other strategies.</strong> FINRA believes this information would assist FINRA in understanding the scope of market participants’ short sale activity,  specifically regarding the use of less-traditional means of establishing short interest. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loan Obligations Resulting From Arranged Financing:</strong> FINRA understands that members may offer arranged financing programs (sometimes called “enhanced lending” or “short arranging products”) through which a customer can borrow shares from the firm’s domestic or foreign affiliate and use those shares to close out a short position in the customer’s account. FINRA is considering requiring members to <strong>report as short interest outstanding stock borrows by customers in their arranged financing programs to better reflect actual short sentiment in the stock.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Shares Outstanding (TSO) and Public Float:</strong> FINRA also is considering including in FINRA-disseminated short interest data, where available, the TSO and public float for securities. FINRA would obtain this information from a third-party source and include it in disseminated information; therefore, this change would not alter firms’ reporting requirements. FINRA believes disseminating a security’s TSO and public float would provide investors with contextual information regarding the relative size of the aggregate short position in the security.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threshold Security Field:</strong><a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/21-19#_edn12">12</a> FINRA is considering including in FINRA-disseminated short interest data a new field that would indicate if the security is a threshold security as of the short interest position reporting settlement date. This change would not alter firms’ reporting requirements. FINRA believes that a security’s status as a threshold security could be useful to investors and other market participants in evaluating an investment decision, and that consolidating this information into disseminated short interest data simplifies the process of obtaining this information for users of the data. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>C. Frequency and Timing of Short Interest Position Reporting and Data Dissemination</strong></p>
<p>Members currently must submit short interest reports to FINRA twice a month and reports are due to FINRA by 6:00 p.m. ET on the second business day after the reporting settlement date designated by FINRA. FINRA is considering requiring firms to report short interest data to FINRA more frequently. Specifically, FINRA is considering <strong>reducing the reporting timeframe to daily or weekly submissions</strong> and, to enable FINRA to disseminate the collected information to the marketplace on a timelier basis, such reports also would be due to FINRA in a shorter timeframe following the applicable settlement date. For example, if FINRA were to require daily submissions, short interest reports could be due by 6:00 p.m. ET one business day after the designated reporting settlement date, and for weekly submissions, short interest reports could be due by 6:00 p.m. ET one business day after the weekly designated reporting settlement date (instead of the current requirement of two business days after the designated reporting settlement date).<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/21-19#_edn13">13</a> </p>
<p>FINRA also is considering reducing the FINRA processing time involved in disseminating short interest data. Currently, FINRA disseminates short interest data for OTC equity securities on the FINRA website seven business days after the designated settlement date, which is five business days after the reports are due from member firms. FINRA is considering reducing this processing time. The proposed reduction in FINRA processing time could apply where firms report short interest to FINRA on a daily or weekly basis, as described above, and also could apply to the current twice a month reporting cycle (with or without a reduced firm turnaround time).</p>
<p>Increasing the frequency and timing of reporting and disseminating short interest data would provide FINRA, other regulators, investors and other market participants with a more current view of short interest information, better inform investors’ and other market participants’ investment decisions, and provide more timely information to FINRA for regulatory use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>D. Information on Allocations of Fail-to-Deliver Positions</strong></p>
<p>Regulation SHO permits a member that is a participant of a registered clearing agency to allocate a portion of its Rule 204 fail-to-deliver position to another broker-dealer based on that other broker-dealer’s short position.<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/21-19#_edn14">14</a> FINRA is considering enhancing its short sale reporting program by adopting a new rule to require members to submit to FINRA (for regulatory purposes only; not for public dissemination) a report of daily allocations of fail-to-deliver positions to correspondent firms pursuant to Rule 204(d) of Regulation SHO. </p>
<p>The proposed allocation report may include the following fields:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Identity of correspondent firm</li>
<li>Amount allocated to correspondent firm (number of shares)</li>
<li>Trade date(s)</li>
<li>Allocation Date</li>
<li>Close out Date</li>
<li>Applicable close out obligation (T+3, T+5 or T+35)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This information would provide FINRA with important supplemental information in support of its Regulation SHO surveillance program. Currently, when there has been a fail-to-deliver, FINRA initiates an inquiry with the clearing firm requesting information on whether the fail-to-deliver has been allocated to a correspondent firm and, if so, the identity of the correspondent firm. Obtaining daily information on fail-to-deliver allocations would allow FINRA to directly identify the member that is responsible for a close-out obligation (without first requesting this information from the clearing firm), and, therefore, would allow FINRA to conduct more efficient investigations.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> FINRA is enhancing it's Short Sale Reporting Program, and has invite the public to provide comments on the proposed changes before August 4, 2021.</p>
<p>It's a positive step forward, but we have to make sure FINRA provide more data transparency, stronger regulation and deeper investigation into illegal naked shorting.</p>
