Hello Superapes!

It's almost Monday and that means another round of Technical Analysis with me Gherkinit.

The first thing I wanted to touch on was the announcement of Jefferies and BOA to no longer lend shares [I covered this in my other DD today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ntpkuy/never_a_borrower_be_a_synopsis_of_gmes_1_borrow/)

As always later tonight I will post a consolidated [Video DD of this on my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial) for those of you that don't have the time to read through this, or have reading comprehension issues it will be posted by 9pm EDT.

\**a note on this in the conclusion*

So let look at our usual suspects

# Technical Analysis for this Week

**The Ascending Channel**

It appears this trend, known as a [broadening formation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broadeningformation.asp), is holding quite strong since it began on May 11^(th). Tuesday we cleanly bounced off the upper-resistance of the previous weeks Bull Flag sending us on the run from $220-294. Forming yet another bull flag for this weeks price action. Upon completion of that run, we had a very direct line of consolidation within resistance to close @ $248.36 on Friday. This continues to imply that buyers are willing to buy higher, shorting is not profitable, and potential sellers are not taking profits (GME undervalued, hedgies are fuk, and apes hodl)

Another thing I noticed this week which I am still determining is that the bull flags are increasing in scale if we break down each one by price action we can see that they are getting bigger.

[Rate of Increase of the 18 days of trading that occurred in this formation](https://preview.redd.it/l13xwivwno371.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5cf72038591423aaa643bf4666d8c92fa406b5e)

**If** this growth rate of 6.4% is exponential, GME should be at:

$338.94 at the end of next week.

$859.60 by close of market on July 2^(nd), 2021

$4,053.48 by close of market on July 30^(th), 2021

Just for fun --->

$7,375,244.54 on January 28^(th), 2022

I'm sure some catalyst will rocket this long before then. However, If the proverbial can keeps getting kicked, this is something to think about.

# Indicators

**MACD**

MACD is looking like it's in a continued upside move looks like the current growth trend is going to continue.

**BBKC/TTM**

GME has begun it's breakout of the squeeze indicator I expect volume and volatility to increase as this pattern expands over the coming week/s.

# Conclusion

I have no reason to believe that the current trend won't continue. So this week I again expect a large run-up in the early part of the week followed by consolidation into the latter half. Monday we may see a continuation of Friday's downtrend to that resistance at 242.50 before we begin the weekly uptrend. I am still keeping my eye on CV\_VWAP but have seen no indication of major arbitrage since Pentecost on May 21^(st).
