What's going on fellow diamond-handed, tendie-hungry apes? I'm here to give you all some confirmation bias about where I think GME is headed based on some technical analysis. I'd like to remind you also that we just had a very good week and things are starting to get juicy as we're approaching levels we haven't seen since January and March. 

In this post, we'll be highlighting two main things: **the FTD cycle** visualized and **common behaviors/patterns** stock like to follow 

If you don't know much about the [FTD cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/myxei0/hank_returns_with_some_ftd_cycle_dd/) somehow at this point, read up on it from u/HomeDepotHank69 and come back here. 

So let's begin!

**I. The Bigger Picture** 

![Here's a look at the daily GME chart since the beginning of 2021](https://preview.redd.it/8e31gzp7ig371.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d03ce4f6fa8d44edb6f39536048330175d911b)

As you can see here, where GME is currently at now, we are about at 50% of the intraday all-time high (ATH) of 483 back in January. The last two weeks including a back-to-back T+35 day and T+21 day have given us enough momentum to hover around the 250s with some pretty solid support around 245 although we went as high as 294 on 6/2. 

![This is the same time frame, just with premarket \(PM\) and after-hours \(AH\) trading included in the graph. Each candle is 4 hours of trading as opposed to 1 day of trading in the previous chart](https://preview.redd.it/llizn0zwkg371.png?width=1776&format=png&auto=webp&s=1be4d06f1fb1c419e035794415c6e360b95af142)

Here we can see that GME's real ATH was at 513.12 in the premarket during the end of January. This chart is included so you get an idea of how our favorite stock has been trading during the year.

Now that you're familiar with GME and the chart, we can move on to the next part.

**II. The FTD Cycle** 

This is a theory we have developed a while ago that seems to have been proven true many times. So far the accuracy is 100% and there's plenty of data to back this up. When it comes to investing/trading for me, I make decisions based on cold, hard facts and data and I fully believe in this concept of a FTD cycle as it makes perfect sense. 

Like I stated before, there are endless posts on this, much more in depth than this explanation, but basically we see a spike in share price every 21 trading days. This is known as T+21 as it includes the settlement period for a day (T) and the 21 days that follow before the next failure to deliver day (+21). Basically (some) of the shares that were borrowed and failed to be delivered in a certain period of time causes a price increase as MM/brokers have to buy shares on the open market, and therefor we see an increase in the stock price.

Many apes have pointed out that this week has been different than the others. As you can see, after the first two T+21 FTD cycles, we saw a big run-up in the stock price both times. On January 25th GME gapped up in the premarket and went as high as 160 before closing back around 75. The next few days a massive gamma squeeze began and the stock went as high as 483 during regular trading hours. Keep in mind that a week prior to that FTD day, GME was trading in a range between 30-45.

The next FTD day was 21 trading days after on February 24th, where the price doubled from 45 at open to 91 at close and tested 200 in the after hours. The next day GME sold off quite a bit, but it trended up for the next few weeks and then went as high as 348.5 in the next few trading sessions.

These two dates (January 25 & February 24) were big moves up and really solidified that the game was not stopped and that the hedgies were really in this thing and fighting to keep it down. It showed them that they had to be prepared for the next FTD days because this wouldn't be as easy as they first thought. 

Because of this, they did their best to keep the next FTD cycles under control. Let's take a look at the next two FTD days, March 25th, and April 26th and see how the stock traded after the run-ups. 

![The white circles highlight the price action of the FTD days](https://preview.redd.it/5uvpibsmsp371.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a460765da502765d89467de9bda5cddf5dd8a2d)

Observe **Figure 1** with the white arrow on the left. This was the day GameStop released Q4 earnings for 2020 along with the wrap-up for the fiscal 2020 year. It was a completely normal call and nothing was incredibly noteworthy on the negative side. However, they did mention a huge increase in ecommerce sales and a shifted company focus to the transition to a mainly ecommerce brand. At this point, they had eliminated most of the debt on the balance sheets by paying off a note and things were looking very bullish for GameStop.

But what do you think the hedgies did?

That's right, they shorted it hard and GME closed down 33% the next day. At the time we just assumed that they wanted to make shareholders think the earning call was overwhelmingly negative and that people were actually selling as opposed to more short positions being opened. But looking back at it, I don't think that was quite the case. 

*The shorts knew that the next day was a failure to deliver day and had no choice but to drop the stock as low as they could before a huge day of buying pressure.* This makes so much more sense looking back at it because the next day, **GME closed up 52%**, a miraculous comeback from the previous day's dip. 

The shorts couldn't let this momentum continue, so for the next few weeks and until the next FTD day, we see a sustained selloff and downtrend in **Figure 2.** 

By the next FTD day 21 days later, GME steadily increases and closes the day up around 12%, not bad. However, the hedgies once again kill the upwards move and momentum by shorting our beloved stock more and more. **Figure 3** shows the familiar sustained selloff to keep the HFs further away from margin call territory. Things keep trending down and sideways as volume decreases significantly, but then the next FTD day comes, and boy is it a beauty. 

![The circle highlights the most recent FTD day and the white lines \(I know, rare white crayon\) show that we're in an ascending channel](https://preview.redd.it/93dmbpshuk371.png?width=1783&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b77377dad23a7fcfe0731bb0348592d8dc8143d)

This breakout is different than the others. We didn't see a big dip the day before like we saw before earnings on 3/23, or a steady selloff prior to the previous FTD day on 4/26. Instead, this time GME was steadily trending up since around 5/10. This is huge since the last few FTD days with double digit percent gains (52% and 12% respectively) have been followed by downtrends and dips to keep the price down and the odds of a sudden upwards reversal low. 

The last 7 trading days have been a solid uptrend, which is very different than the following 7 days of the last few FTD days. If this trend continues the way the first two big FTD cycles did back in January and February, we may see a big move upward soon in the next 3-5 trading days. 

Now that you're all caught up with the FTD cycles and the current trend of our favorite stock, let's move on to the juicy part. 

**III. Common Stock Behaviors & Patterns** 

After watching a stock or multiple stocks for a while, you get familiar with certain patterns and tendencies that just keep happening. Although GME is heavily manipulated with all of the aggressive and illegal naked shorting going on, it still conforms to many patterns that stocks tend to follow. One thing to keep in mind with a stock and looking at its chart is that the chart is essentially telling a story of where the stock has traded in the past. 

People buy and sell stocks and there are always people who think it is going up and there are always people who think it is going down. This creates a market and this is how prices move, using the most smooth-brained explanation. There are individual investors (retail traders) and institutional investors (hedge funds, money managers, market makers, etc.) who have either gone long or short at any point in time and at any price. This means people have seen the stock and been involved with it at all different price points, whether high or low. So when someone says something like "the stock wants to go up," or "it looks like it wants to drop," it really means that the people behind it want to make it move a certain way in their favorable direction. 

Keeping this in mind, GME wants to go up for a few reasons. Stocks like to make highs, have healthy pullbacks/dips and recover to test those highs and potentially break through and create new highs, which we call a "breakout." When you think about it, it just makes sense. Some retailers and institutional investors have seen the price at $XXX before and want to see it get there again or possibly further. 

For long-term price action, there are two common scenarios: 

**Scenario 1 -** The price tests the a certain level (most likely a previous all-time high), and either gets rejected and drops, only to test it another day, or it breaks through and creates a new high and the process repeats itself. This tends to happen with healthier companies with potential and attention of retailers and institutions. 

**Scenario 2 -** The same situation but flipped occurs as well for stocks that make new lows. Investors who see a stock is worth less than the market values it help drive down the price and bring it lower to where they'd like to see it. This tends to happen to weaker, older companies that are forgotten about or nearly obscure and have flawed business models/markets. 

However, if you're a publicly traded company and have any possibility of future growth in your industry, odds are that the first scenario mentioned happens with new highs being established and tested. Unless your company is at risk of going out of business, being delisted from an exchange where it is publicly traded, or part of a failing industry, would it make sense for scenario 2 to be a possibility for new lows to be established and tested. 

GME was in scenario 2, not too long ago, *or at least it was thought to be*, by the hedge funds who shorted the hell out of it for years. As we all know now, they were very wrong as GameStop belongs in scenario 1 as it is an essential part in the very explosively growing gaming industry with lots of potential to corner the market. 

So now that we know GME is in scenario 1, what does that mean for the stock? Glad you asked. People invested in companies that have future potential want to see it succeed and if there's not many reasons it could fail, it only makes sense to trend upwards (in the bigger picture). All of this is considered very bullish, even without accounting for a MOASS, massive unclosed naked short positions, and heavy market manipulation. This stock wants to go up and test its highs as it is obvious now to the entire world that GameStop is not on its last leg. 

There is evidence of this in the charts as well. As I stated before, stocks like to make highs and test them. The higher the price and greater the pull-back, the longer it may take to test those highs. Short-term highs are created and tested constantly in many stocks, but we're zooming out a bit this time to get a better look. Long term highs like to be tested and we have seen this a few times throughout the last six months on GME. 

**Take a look at this chart and get familiar with these important levels** 

![I included notes on this chart, but will be doing a breakdown for all of these levels](https://preview.redd.it/q8svsestyp371.png?width=1776&format=png&auto=webp&s=66ca0a69bc2e81fdd3c4b037a003ad941d076642)

**Let's break it down for you from left to right**

We see that January's highs around 480-520 are the highest levels we could be testing soon. It doesn't seem likely that we get rejected at these levels, so once we breakout from there, who knows where the price could end up. This is the almighty long-term resistance GME faces. As stated earler, this is the highest price, so it is expected to take the most time to test. 

Next up we have the second battle of 200. In February, GME spiked in the last hour of trading (power hour) and went as high as 200 in the after hours before coming back down the 160s at the end of after-hours trading. This was a very important day because it showed us that the game wasn't over yet. For the next few days, GME stayed below 200, but that level was kept in mind. It wanted to be tested since it was GME's newest short-term high. Sure enough, only several days later, GME broke through 200 and closed above it. 

The uptrend continued in March to the point where it started testing levels not seen since January. It broke past 250 and 300 and went as high as 348.50, just before coming crashing down as hedgies dropped the price 50% in half an hour to 172. We now have a resistance level at 348.50 that is likely to be tested again sometime soon. 

After that big drop, GME continued to "sell-off" for a few weeks and established a new low between 116-120 after GME's Q4 earnings report. This level is yet to be tested, but isn't likely to any time soon. This gave us apes a pretty good idea where a strong support was and where we could expect heavy buying pressure in case of another dip. 

The next several weeks have heavy consolidation while GME trades in a range between 135 and 200. However, we are currently in an uptrend as we broke out to the upside of the range and passed the 200 level (remember the 200 resistance from February?). A new short-term high of 294 was established on 6/2 and is likely to be tested soon given the current momentum of GME. 

**Now that we know all the data, FTD cycle information, and key areas, what is the take away?**

This is my equivalent of a TL:DR as I try to summarize everything you learned today. GameStop stock is on a current uptrend and takes a similar trajectory to January and February run-ups, which is very promising. The FTD cycles have helped ignite the spark and give GME the momentum it needs to break and hold key levels like 200 and 250, which were just tested recently. The next key areas/short term highs we are looking to test next include 294-300 and 348.5-350. If we can successfully break through those shorter-term highs, then the real all time highs are on the menu. It is very possible that we can test areas between 480-520 in the next few trading days or weeks, depending on what happens at the annual shareholder meeting and the price action we see this week. Things are starting to line up for us, and I'm personally jacked to the tits for this week. Stay strong and hold the line, fellow apes, we're so close, I can feel it.
