<p>Hello Superapes!</p>
<p>It's almost Monday and that means another round of Technical Analysis with me Gherkinit.</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to touch on was the announcement of Jefferies and BOA to no longer lend shares <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ntpkuy/never_a_borrower_be_a_synopsis_of_gmes_1_borrow/">I covered this in my other DD today</a></p>
<p>As always later tonight I will post a consolidated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial">Video DD of this on my YouTube</a> for those of you that don't have the time to read through this, or have reading comprehension issues it will be posted by 9pm EDT.</p>
<p>*<em>a note on this in the conclusion</em></p>
<p>So let look at our usual suspects</p>
<h1>Technical Analysis for this Week</h1>
<p><strong>The Ascending Channel</strong></p>
<p>It appears this trend, known as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broadeningformation.asp">broadening formation</a>, is holding quite strong since it began on May 11^(th). Tuesday we cleanly bounced off the upper-resistance of the previous weeks Bull Flag sending us on the run from $220-294. Forming yet another bull flag for this weeks price action. Upon completion of that run, we had a very direct line of consolidation within resistance to close @ $248.36 on Friday. This continues to imply that buyers are willing to buy higher, shorting is not profitable, and potential sellers are not taking profits (GME undervalued, hedgies are fuk, and apes hodl)</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed this week which I am still determining is that the bull flags are increasing in scale if we break down each one by price action we can see that they are getting bigger.</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> this growth rate of 6.4% is exponential, GME should be at:</p>
<p>$338.94 at the end of next week.</p>
<p>$859.60 by close of market on July 2^(nd), 2021</p>
<p>$4,053.48 by close of market on July 30^(th), 2021</p>
<p>Just for fun ---&gt;</p>
<p>$7,375,244.54 on January 28^(th), 2022</p>
<p>I'm sure some catalyst will rocket this long before then. However, If the proverbial can keeps getting kicked, this is something to think about.</p>
<h1>Indicators</h1>
<p><strong>MACD</strong></p>
<p>MACD is looking like it's in a continued upside move looks like the current growth trend is going to continue.</p>

<p><strong>BBKC/TTM</strong></p>
<p>GME has begun it's breakout of the squeeze indicator I expect volume and volatility to increase as this pattern expands over the coming week/s.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I have no reason to believe that the current trend won't continue. So this week I again expect a large run-up in the early part of the week followed by consolidation into the latter half. Monday we may see a continuation of Friday's downtrend to that resistance at 242.50 before we begin the weekly uptrend. I am still keeping my eye on CV_VWAP but have seen no indication of major arbitrage since Pentecost on May 21^(st).</p>
