<p>There's not much to say, but there is too much attention on Apes setting stop losses or selling on a drop.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Apes are not selling.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Apes are not selling at 420.69.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Apes are not setting stop losses.</p>
<p>I trust you all, go forth with nothing but faith in your Ape-kind and pay no mind.</p>
<p>IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT HERE BREAKING WALLS AND BEING EXCITED! NOBODY IS SELLING, BUT GET HYPE CUZ EVERY $1 INCREASE IS $1 CLOSER TO FORCED LIQUIDATION. </p>
