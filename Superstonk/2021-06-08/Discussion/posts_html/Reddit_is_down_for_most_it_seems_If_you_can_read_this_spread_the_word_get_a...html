<p>Adding text for the sake of the 250 character rule. </p>
<p>got notification from @heyitspixel69 on Twitter this morning that Reddit was kicking a 503 error.</p>
<p>As suggested by others I use NordVPN and it seems to work fine.</p>
<p>I love you all, see you on the moon!</p>
<p>That is all</p>
<p>Edit: that was all…</p>
<p>Question that came up that I’m unsure of:</p>
<p>-What are angles of approach if/when the internet goes down and our floor has been savagely surpassed? More specifically, how do we sell our shares i.e. email, phone, etc?</p>
<p>Inversely, FORCE us to hold forever, I fucking dare them 🤣</p>
<p>Ediit: better VPN suggestions have been made MullVad VPN and ProtonVPN</p>
<p>for NordVPN I found that loading different locations finally landed me on a server that got me through.</p>
<p>As well, redditstatus.com has a list of the fastly servers that are operational. Thanks u/s1609</p>
<p>Also, I was recently made aware of plan b: </p>

<p>Conclusion: due to mechanisms that I don’t completely understand one or more major CDNs (content delivery networks) went down this morning for no reason that I have supporting evidence to point to. </p>
