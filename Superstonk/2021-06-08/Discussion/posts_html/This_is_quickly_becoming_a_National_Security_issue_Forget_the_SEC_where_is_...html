<p>These economic terrorists at Citadel and Susquehanna have shown quite clearly that they will stop at nothing short of disrupting our communications platforms in order to prevent themselves from losing money while gambling on the stock market.</p>
<p>Where does this lead next if this terrorism is not curtailed?  Disrupting the power grid?  What if you relied on these comms platforms to be able to make an emergency call for help?  Or to do business on?  Just how vulnerable are we to their whims?</p>
<p>Remember, these funds and institutions are legendary for stopping at nothing, even the laws of the countries they operate in are not respected.  They are willing to go to any length to buy another day to stay in the fight.</p>
<p>There is risk present here that cannot be further ignored.</p>
<p>Look, in 2015 China kicked Citadel out of their country for shady activities revolving around their HFT short selling antics.  Read about that here;</p>

<p>"In addition to Citadel Securities and the four domestic investment firms, three local brokerages that facilitated the trades for Citadel Securities were fined an additional 416 million yuan ($60 million) for <strong>margin financing violations and short selling</strong>. The CSRC later cleared the brokerages but issued fines totaling 15.2 million yuan ($2.1 million) on four domestic firms involved in the probe. </p>
<p>The $97 million settlement for Citadel Securities is “more than 40 times the combined” fee paid by domestic firms implicated in the probe, according to the FT, and four times the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-24/goldman-agrees-to-22-million-settlement-with-china-regulator">$22 million settlement</a> Goldman Sachs paid for similar 2015 trading infractions."</p>
<p>They were kicked out of fricking CHINA for being too corrupt!  Think about that and let it sink in.</p>
<p>They haven't changed, they've simply grown more bold.  And it's time to put an end to this before it exposes us to even more risk.</p>
<p>The risk is not worth keeping them afloat here any longer.  People's livelihoods are at stake, their retirements, pensions and investments.  Business owners, hard working Americans that need their 3 letter agencies at a time right now, to just do their damn jobs.</p>
<p>Now am I saying that Citadel and Susquehanna are responsible for today's outage timed precisely, exactly with the crash from the runup?    </p>
<p>I'm not, because I can't prove this myself.</p>
<p><strong>But it's not my fucking job to</strong>.  All I can do is ask questions, hold open discussions, raise awareness and buy more and hold.  Today was a good day for me for doing my part, I did all of those things and I can sleep well tonight as a result.</p>
