 Adding text for the sake of the 250 character rule. 

got notification from @heyitspixel69 on Twitter this morning that Reddit was kicking a 503 error.

As suggested by others I use NordVPN and it seems to work fine.

I love you all, see you on the moon!

That is all

Edit: that was all…

Question that came up that I’m unsure of:

-What are angles of approach if/when the internet goes down and our floor has been savagely surpassed? More specifically, how do we sell our shares i.e. email, phone, etc?

Inversely, FORCE us to hold forever, I fucking dare them 🤣

Ediit: better VPN suggestions have been made MullVad VPN and ProtonVPN

for NordVPN I found that loading different locations finally landed me on a server that got me through.

As well, redditstatus.com has a list of the fastly servers that are operational. Thanks u/s1609

Conclusion: due to mechanisms that I don’t completely understand one or more major CDNs (content delivery networks) went down this morning for no reason that I have supporting evidence to point to.
