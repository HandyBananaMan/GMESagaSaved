<p><strong>EDIT AFTER THE Q1 EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> I am sorry to report, Apes, that we missed criteria (6) below. It was a good fight, but the additional buying pressure by Apes couldn't quite make up for the fact that Q1 always tends to be the most sluggish quarter for retailers. But, we march on and creeping that profitability up - let's see how the Q2 results go in three months!</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The S&amp;P 500 quarterly rebalancing announcement is next Friday 18th June. After the Shareholder Meeting tomorrow, and with it the 2021 Q1 earnings results, we will know if GME meets the eligibility criteria for inclusion. All signs point to the criteria being met, at which point up to the S&amp;P selection committee to decide if GME will be added. This appears to be a very distinct possibility, and if so GME will enter the index at around the 350 mark in the list by market capitalization. </p>
<p>Consequently, asset management firms that manage ETFs tied to the S&amp;P 500 will have no choice but to rapidly and mandatorily add GME shares to their index tracking funds. Hence a large volume of GME shares could be forced bought in the open market, possibly leading to a squeeze in the share price (similar to Tesla's +70% run-up last year, in the five weeks after their S&amp;P 500 inclusion was announced). </p>
<p>Such a run-up in the share price has the potential to reach the margin call price for some of the short hedge funds, so this could become a catalyst for the MOASS itself. The best part is: there is nothing Shitadel and friends can do about it, as the buying pressure will be coming from their competitors - who are forced <em>by their business models</em> to buy more of the stock.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS THIS DD ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p>Apes, this is a follow-up to my post yesterday regarding the probable shift of GME within the Russell Indexes, from its current Russell 2000 small-cap index status to the Russell 1000 large- and mid-cap index instead:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nu91kx/russell_1000_many_poorly_researched_or_purely/h0wbdrk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</p>
<p>As the conclusion to this DD, I stated that the Russell reconstitution is likely to have a neutral effect on GME share price. However, I added that the index rebalancing that could have a much greater impact is the following (copy-and-pasted from yesterday's post):</p>
<p><strong>THE INDEX THAT REALLY DOES MATTER: S&amp;P 500</strong></p>
<p><em>The Russell Indexes are actually more important for micro- and small-cap, than for mid-cap and larger firms such as what GME has now become. The reason being that the S&amp;P Indexes dominate in the larger cap area, whereas the Russell Indexes are more for the smaller cap arena. Hence the larger a firm grows, the more important the S&amp;P Indexes become. As such, asset management firms tend to use the S&amp;P Indexes - and especially the S&amp;P 500 - for constructing their large cap Index ETFs. There are 14 S&amp;P 500 tied ETFs available and their combined AUMs are enormous, close to $900 billion i.e. about 30x bigger than the two Russell 1000 ETFs. Depending on GME's market capitalisation at the time, it could mean a huge number of shares being mandatorily having to be bought in the open market, so that these ETFs are correctly matching the S&amp;P 500 Index including GME. Incidentally, criteria for entry to the S&amp;P 500 index are as follows:</em></p>
<p><em>(1) Market capitalization must be greater than or equal to US$11.8 billion</em></p>
<p><em>(2) Annual dollar value traded to float-adjusted market capitalization is greater than 1.0</em></p>
<p><em>(3) Minimum monthly trading volume of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date</em></p>
<p><em>(4) Must be publicly listed on either the New York Stock Exchange (including NYSE Arca or NYSE American) or NASDAQ (NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Select Market or the NASDAQ Capital Market).</em></p>
<p><em>(5) The company should be from the U.S.</em></p>
<p><em>(6) The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter</em></p>
<p><em>Assuming GME maintains a share above 167, criteria (1) on the above list is fulfilled, meaning it would only need to achieve criteria (6) to meet all six requirements. </em><em>I think it is likely GME will achieve this by Q3 earnings</em><em>, so inclusion within the S&amp;P 500 is very possible after that. If that happens, then each of those S&amp;P 500 tracking ETFs is required to go out and buy the shares in the open market. This is certain to create demand and upward movement to the share price, similar to Tesla's run after it was announced they would be entering the S&amp;P 500 about six months ago. (As a point of comparison Tesla’s share price increased by more than 70%, from when S&amp;P announced the inclusion to the rebalancing deadline date five weeks later. This was mainly fueled by the asset managers of these 14 ETFs having to buy the stock in the open market.)</em></p>
<p><strong>WHY I AM POSTING ANOTHER DD</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to some follow-up comments by u/EtoshOE, u/yUnG_wiTe and u/hikurashi83 about the S&amp;P 500 eligibility criteria section of the previous DD, I decided to do some additional research into the matter. In particular, my appreciation to u/hikurashi83 who made the following comment regarding criteria (6) and my <em>erroneous</em> assertion of when this is likely to be achieved:</p>
<p><em>(6) The </em><em>sum</em><em> of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter</em></p>
<p>u/Region-Formal:  <em>I think it is likely GME will achieve this by Q3 earnings</em></p>
<p>u/hikurashi83:  <em>Calculating the last three earnings: (-1.4) + (-0.53) + (1.34) = -0.59</em>
<em>Wouldn't this mean that the next earning (this Wednesday) will only need to be +0.59 for criteria (6) to be fulfilled? I'm quite confident the upcoming Q1 EPS will be atleast 1.00 with all the media attention on GME recently.</em></p>
<p>Let's see if u/hikurashi83 is correct about criteria (6) and also whether GME would meet the other five criteria as well...</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED CHECKLIST OF S&amp;P 500 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p>S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the company behind this basket of indexes, updates their eligibility criteria on a fairly regular basis. They seem to have updated it once again within the last week, and the new criteria can be found on pages 6-8 of the latest "Methodology" report which I have summarised below. Link: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf</p>
<p>(1) Market capitalization must be greater than or equal to <strong>US$13.1 billion</strong> --&gt; <em>This has increased from the previous threshold of US$11.8 billion</em></p>
<p>(2) Annual dollar value traded to float-adjusted market capitalization is greater than 1.0</p>
<p>(3) Minimum monthly trading volume of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date</p>
<p>(4) Must be publicly listed on either the New York Stock Exchange (including NYSE Arca or NYSE American) or NASDAQ (NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Select Market or the NASDAQ Capital Market).</p>
<p>(5) The company should be from the U.S.</p>
<p>(6) The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter</p>
<p>Let's look at whether GME meets each of these requirements:</p>
<p>(1) Market capitalization must be greater than or equal to US$13.1 billion
<em>Criteria Met?</em>  <strong>YES!</strong>  Market capitalization is currently $19.81 billion (Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME)</p>
<p>(2) Annual dollar value traded to float-adjusted market capitalization is greater than 1.0
<em>Criteria Met?</em>  <strong>YES!</strong>  Even over just the last few weeks, the value traded comfortably exceeds $19.81 (Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/)</p>
<p>(3) Minimum monthly trading volume of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date
<em>Criteria Met?</em>  <strong>YES!</strong>  GME's traded volume has been higher than this <em>in the first hour</em> of every trading day in the last six months (Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/)</p>
<p>(4) Must be publicly listed on either the New York Stock Exchange (including NYSE Arca or NYSE American) or NASDAQ (NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Select Market or the NASDAQ Capital Market).
<em>Criteria Met?</em>  <strong>YES!</strong>  Listed on the New York Stock Exchange (Link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME)</p>
<p>(5) The company should be from the U.S.
<em>Criteria Met?</em>  <strong>YES!</strong>  Corporate headquarters are located in Grapevine, Texas (Link: https://www.corporate-office-headquarters.com/gamestop-corp)</p>
<p>(6) The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter
<em>Criteria Met?</em>  This is the most critical criteria, which we are not sure will be met just yet... Let's take a look at GME's Quarterly Income Statements, which are available here:</p>
<p>https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/fundamentals/income-statement?156992e2-9280-4b8f-9b3c-ae6891fc87e2%5Btimeframe_display%5D=quarter&amp;url=</p>
<p>According to these, the Normalized Income (i.e. net income excluding discontinued operations) is as follows:</p>
<p>Quarter Ending Jan 2021 = US$80.50 million --&gt; US$1.34 EPS</p>
<p>Quarter Ending Oct 2020 = US$-18.80 million --&gt; US$-0.50 EPS</p>
<p>Quarter Ending Aug 2020 = US$-117.76 million --&gt; US$-1.81 EPS</p>
<p>The combined Normalized Income over these three quarters is of US$-56.56 million, or US$-0.97 EPS. <strong>I am not an accounting expert, so if there is any Ape more knowledgeable in this field then please let us know!</strong> But according to the above calculations, if the Normalzed Income that is reported tomorrow exceeds US$56.56 million, then <strong>YES!</strong> - I believe criteria (6) will indeed be met!</p>
<p><strong>AWESOME! WEN S&amp;P?</strong></p>
<p>Whoa there! Hold yer horses! I wish life were so simple, but you should know by now hodling GME: it very rarely is... Unlike the Russell reconstitution, which is carried out through fixed calculations only, the S&amp;P 500 constituents and rebalancing are ultimately decided by a committee within S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Historically they have not been ones for knee-jerk reactions, and prefer to keep the constituent list fairly stable, particularly in volatile times. For example, last year over 100 companies suddenly fell below the market capitalization criteria as a result of the pandemic, but the committee decided not to drop them from the list in order to maintain the stability of the index. Most of these companies bounced back quickly through the course of 2020, and their market capitalizations recovered above the threshold, so I guess the committe's decision was vindicated.</p>
<p>At the same time, unless there are some exceptional reasons, companies fulfilling the six eligible criteria are given very serious consideration for inclusion. As you can see from the list of additions and deletions, they do approve fairly steady changes to the constituents. And in my opinion GME has better fundamentals than many firms already in the list, including some of those added recently: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies#Selected_changes_to_the_list_of_S&amp;P_500_components</p>
<p>One famous example of a company that met the eligibility criteria in the middle of last year, but had to wait for a couple of rebalancing rounds before eventual inclusion was Tesla. Although the S&amp;P selection committee did not provide a reason for their initial exclusion of Tesla, speculation is that this was due to something quite unique to how Tesla qualified for criteria (6). As pointed out in this article (Link: https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1229880/this-could-be-why-tesla-was-excluded-from-the-sp-500), the probable reason was because Tesla were only profitable due to the selling of Regulatory Credits. These are subsidies that auto makers receive from state governmments for production of electric vehicles. As the article states: <em>"Since Tesla produces nothing but EVs, the company racks up way more credits than it needs to meet the minimum regulatory requirements, so it turns around and sells the excess credits to other automakers so that they can avoid penalties."</em></p>
<p>Hence the speculation is that the S&amp;P committee decided not to immediately include Tesla in the constitutents, because they were worried about the long-term viability of their income streams. It was only later in the year, last November, that the committee felt sufficiently confident that Tesla were generating income through selling their core products - cars - and thus decided to add them to the S&amp;P 500 list. If all this is correct, then it was a unique issue specific to the EV automotive industry, and one that would not be relevant to GME. </p>
<p>Yes, GME's share price has been volatile over the last year, and no doubt the potential for a Short Squeeze further heightens that. Volatility is probably another key thing the committee looks at, but I would conjecture that the company's fundamentals over the last six months have been strong and getting stronger. Furthermore, the committees would have been worried at the sheer size of Tesla, and therefore its weighting within the index - something that would not be quite of concern for GME. </p>
<p>Hence in my opinion, there is a chance - <em>perhaps even a good chance</em> - that the committee will choose to include GME in the next rebalancing. We will not have to wait long to find out if this happens, in fact: the critical date of this next S&amp;P constituents rebalancing announcement is Friday 18th June!

<p><strong>WHAT COULD BE THE IMPACT OF INCLUSION IN THE S&amp;P 500</strong></p>
<p>As I stated in the previous DD, this could be big. I mean, really BIG! There are 14 ETFs which are directly tied to the S&amp;P 500, but also dozens of others that are derivatives of it, managed by the largest asset management firms in the world. The entire business model of these ETFs is to replicate the base S&amp;P 500 index as closely as possible, using either a market capitalization based weighting model or (less commonly) an equal weighting model. You can find the very long list of ETFs - worth more than $5 <em>trillion</em> combined in Assets Under Management, if including all the derivative funds - that are tied to the S&amp;P 500 here: https://etfdb.com/indexes/equity/</p>
<p>As for how many shares all these ETFs may require for correctly reflecting an index that has GME added, let's take a look at Cincinatti Financial (ticker: CINF). I have chosen this company because they are the current S&amp;P 500 consitutent which has the closest market capitalzation ($19.77 billion) to that of GME ($19.81 billion). Note that they are currently the 356th largest company by market capitalization in the index. I calculated (using https://www.etf.com/stock/CINF) that there are 31 ETFs holding CINF stock, worth a total of over $886 million. If GME is added to the S&amp;P 500, and the weighting allocated is similar to that of CINF, it could potentially mean shares to a similar value of $886 million are necessary to be bought, in order to correctly reflect the index. <strong>At this time of writing the share price is $280.01, so this equates to 3.16 million shares of GME that must fill S&amp;P 500 tracking ETFs within five weeks of June 18th.</strong></p>
<p>One thing to note is that not all 3.16 million shares (or however many there may be) will have to be bought in the open market. GME is currently held in 80 ETFs (https://www.etf.com/stock/GME) but many of these are small-cap category ETFs of Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street. I guess these firms will shift some of these shares from their small-cap funds, where they currently are held, to their S&amp;P 500 tracking ETFs instead i.e. 'internal' transfers only, so these shares will not see the light of day. However, I think there will still be a very significant deficit that needs to be made up (1 million shares? 2 million shares? even more if the share price drops between now and the 18th?) and also a number of S&amp;P 500 ETFs of other asset managers that currently do not hold GME at all. They would be forced to buy these addtional necessary shares in the open market, and given how tightly held GME shares are right now...those five weeks will almost certainly lead to upward pressure on the stock price.</p>
<p>Repeating what I wrote in the previous post, Tesla's stock price increased by 70% in the five weeks from the rebalancing announcement up to the deadline for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 tracking ETFs. This included a spike in the last week prior to the 21st December 2020 deadline, as desperate fund managers chased reluctant sellers with ever increasing price offers to buy the last few required shares. Dare I say GME holders, including hundreds of thousands of Apes, will probably not let go of their GME shares quite as easily as those Tesla holders did. Sounds like an S&amp;P 500 inclusion fuelled squeeze is therefore very possible, if all this plays out as described above! </p>
<p>Hence my assertion that inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 could become a catalyst for the MOASS itself...and there is nothing short hedge funds such as Shitadel can do to stop it. This buying pressure will mainly come from their giant ETF managing competitors such as the "Big Three" buy side institutions: Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street. These are firms that already have strong incentives to wipe out the likes of Shitadel anyway, and have perhaps been waiting for a legitimate chance to do so that does not cause them any issues with the regulators. If the MOASS has not already happened by then, GME being added to the S&amp;P 500 could be just the opportunity they have been waiting for...</p>
<p><strong>Additional note on how index rebalancing could lead to recalls of shares lent out to short sellers:</strong> There were many comments and questions about this, after the post yesterday. As I stated when responding to one of these comments, I am not an expert in this particular area, and thus invite more learned Apes on this topic to contribute. There is speculation that one other reason for Tesla's run up, after their inclusion was announced, was because of shorted shares being recalled. Maybe, maybe not... Personally, I can see this could be the case if a company <em>drops out</em> of an index, and thus the fund managers wanting the shares back in order to sell them out of their ETFs. Not quite sure there is compelling logic dictating a similar dynamic, when a stock is <em>added</em> to an index. But again, I bow to the feedback of those more knowledgeable in this particular area.</p>
