<p>I spent a fuck tons of money getting a degree in Finance. For all those years, what I learned was market is efficient and fair. Supply and demand should drive the market. It will correct itself with price discovery. Blah blah blah. I was so naive to fucking believed it.</p>
<p>Anyone with 1 braincell will see that it's not true at all. Just fucking look at the price action and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nu9qq9/hanks_big_bang_quant_apes_glitch_the_simulation/">correlation between meme stocks</a>. It is absolutely disgusting. A cinema is being traded almost exactly the same way as a store that selling game? And almost exactly similar to a company that making phone?</p>
<p>And the guy who runs one of the biggest stock broker, the first one that restricted stock buying because he was afraid it will break the system, came online and said it is impossible to naked short because the penalty is severe? What the actual fuck? Sure, that makes sense. Speeding on the road is impossible because the penalty is also very severe. Driving under influence is also impossible because the penalty is also very severe. Murder is also impossible because the penalty could also be very severe. What kind of fucking logic is that? Unless English is his 4th language and he doesn't understand the meaning of the word 'impossible'.</p>
<p>The whole financial system is a joke. It is just an extended arm of the riches to exploit the poor. They can pull the plug whenever they want. Efficient my ass!</p>
<p>Even the education system is a shame. It is so disconnected with reality that it creates more harm than any good to society. Either that or it is also manipulated by the rich to brainwash society.</p>
<p>After the MOASS, I will not invest in stocks anymore. It is the biggest scam in the history.</p>
<p>End rant.</p>
