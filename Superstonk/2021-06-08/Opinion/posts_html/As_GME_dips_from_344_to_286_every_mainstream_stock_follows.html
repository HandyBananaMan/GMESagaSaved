<p>Tell me it ain't fucking market manipulation that AT THE EXACT SAME TIME our stonk drops, everything else follows: AMC, BB, TLRY, RKT... Every stock that has been in WSB focus in the past few months, suddenly tanks.</p>
<p>At the exact.same.second.</p>
<p>But nooooo, that can't be fuckery, amirite? That's perfectly normal market behaviour when otherwise completely disconnected stocks suddenly fall the same way, for the same time.</p>
