Tell me it ain't fucking market manipulation that AT THE EXACT SAME TIME our stonk drops, everything else follows: AMC, BB, TLRY, RKT... Every stock that has been in WSB focus in the past few months, suddenly tanks.

At the exact.same.second.

But nooooo, that can't be fuckery, amirite? That's perfectly normal market behaviour when otherwise completely disconnected stocks suddenly fall the same way, for the same time.
