<p>I'm sure a lot of us have had childish excitement and adventure once again, re-enter our lives, and I just wanted to take a short minute to wish a happy birthday to the man who made it all possible.</p>
<p>We banded together and each poured a drink to celebrate with you from across the globe.</p>

<p>From us, and the millions of other apes:</p>
<p><strong><em>Happy Deep Fucking Birthday Keith!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We hope you have a fantastic day!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>God Speed!</em></strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thanks again!  </p>
<p>Edit: To avoid this being spammed, I did take around 50 people's "happy birthdays" and place them all into one post. But I will understand if this is removed for spam.</p>
