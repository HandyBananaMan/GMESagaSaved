I'm sure a lot of us have had childish excitement and adventure once again, re-enter our lives, and I just wanted to take a short minute to wish a happy birthday to the man who made it all possible.

We banded together and each poured a drink to celebrate with you from across the globe.

From us, and the millions of other apes:

***Happy Deep Fucking Birthday Keith!***

***We hope you have a fantastic day!***

***God Speed!***

Thanks again!  


Edit: To avoid this being spammed, I did take around 50 people's "happy birthdays" and place them all into one post. But I will understand if this is removed for spam.
