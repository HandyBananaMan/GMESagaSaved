<p>Edit: Some Apes are making good points regarding this being an unlikely connection. I will leave the post up unless a mod asks me to remove it, but likely a coincidence Apes. ALTHOUGH the timing and the chart similarities are just fucking weird. </p>
<p>Edit2: u/snowbagels draws attention to DDoS...
"As someone who works in tech, and who sees their CDN (content delivery network) was the culprit, I have four words: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack."</p>
<p>“Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a growing threat for content delivery network (CDN) administrators. A DDoS CDN attack uses malware to take control of thousands of computers, often referred to as botnets, and direct them to flood a particular CDN with so many requests that it cannot adequately respond to legitimate traffic.”</p>

<p>I’ve got raging confirmation bias. Turns out the error returned when denied access to these sites was error 503.</p>
<p>“The internet was brought to its knees Tuesday, with 503 errors showing up across the news outlets and websites. A fix came just over an hour later.”</p>
<p>https://www.cnet.com/news/fastly-outage-how-and-why-it-just-broke-amazon-reddit-paypal-twitch-and-much-of-the-internet/</p>
<p>What is error 503?</p>
<p>“An Error 503 is essentially a sign that the website's server has been comprised by a temporary overload (or sometimes purposeful maintenance). A DDoS attack (short for Distributed Denial of Service) is when a malicious party flood the bandwidth or resources of a specific system.”</p>

<p>This is not a coincidence. Also, note a lot of people use twitch to stream their trading content and are stating they’ll be hosting the shareholder meeting on twitch tomorrow as well. Reddit is the primary source of communication for GME discussion.</p>
<p>Holy shit. Say what you will, but that’s an awful lot of coincidences.</p>
<p>Edit3: u/ethervillage 
Initially, I thought, “OK, here we go, tinfoil hat time”. However, having worked in IT for close to 30yrs, my mind was changed after I read this. The amount of investment Citadel has in Fastly really isn’t important. The important part is that they are both connected financially. For this reason, and knowing how totally corrupt these dirtbags are, I find it absolutely believable that a DDoS attack would originate from Fastly’s network (as the BBC has stated), in order to impede the inescapable MOASS that’s coming. If they did impact network traffic, it’s a very, very good bet they will be doing it again as needed. Who cares if it’s illegal? What’s anyone going to do? Litigate? Maybe. If so, that will take time, something these criminals are in dire need of. This could be very important and I hope gets more attention.</p>
