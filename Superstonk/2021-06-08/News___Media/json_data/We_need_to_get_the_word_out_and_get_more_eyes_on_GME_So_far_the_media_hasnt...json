    "selftext": "**TL:DR I have now registered my song, The Tendieman, to be played on the radio. I am in contact with a fellow ape (** u/HelloYouBeautiful **) who has contacted radio stations AROUND THE WORLD to play this song for all to hear on Wednesday 6/9 (P.S. He and I have a non-monetized agreement). BUT this is where I need a hand. We need people to contact these stations telling them that YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE TENDIEMAN. We can only convince the stations to play the song initially. Contact info, times, and radio stations will be listed at the bottom of this post. You can also call in to your own local stations and request they play The Tendieman as well. More calls = higher chance of it being played.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI made The Tendieman ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oI\\_8YG6Vs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oI_8YG6Vs)) during the warm up squeeze back in late January. It gained a lot of traction around the world and brought a lot of eyes to this wonderful stock. Since then, large media outlets have been trying to lead the average person astray, citing their years of expertise and knowledge of the market. As an average Joe, you'd have no reason to think they're wrong. But we all know THEY ARE and they are deliberately skirting around the whole truth so that their sponsors can make more money.\n\n&#x200B;\nSurprised pikachu\n[u\\/jkz69](https://preview.redd.it/6rf0f2u412471.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c71400405694183fe16cd3bbe10037091385347)\n\nSO, to help spread the truth or at least bring more of the public's eyes on this, I will be submitting The Tendieman to radio stations around the world to play on the day of the shareholder's meeting. Not all of the stations we've contacted were keen to play it BUT YOU CAN STILL REQUEST THIS SONG FROM YOUR LOCAL RADIO STATION. The more requests, the more likely they will play it. @ them on Twitter with #Tendieman and maybe we can get it trending!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Here are the radio stations that will be playing The Tendieman\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*This is in chronological order for the time of day it will be broadcast.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Airing Date: Wednesday, June 9th\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Blunt Radio UK Digital Only - (Times below)**\n\n[Blunt Radio times](https://preview.redd.it/19ps6edd12471.png?width=323&format=png&auto=webp&s=31f2abe0eb196a7003313e8f5de06241ec9d3a24)\n\nThey will be playing the song 11 times tomorrow AT 20 PAST DURING EACH OF THESE HOURS!
