A paragraph from an article on Yahoo finance.  Who would describe money made on the stock market as "winnings"?  It's not a casino though? It's not a lottery? It's science based money making? HA, HA, HA.  I can't wait for us all to "WIN"

Before members of Congress in February, Keith Gill — who became a folk hero for his **winnings** made buying GameStop shares and options — ![reiterated that he believed shares of the company were attractive](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-shares-jump-as-keith-roaringkitty-gill-testified-before-house-committee-183156915.html) relative to the company's long-term growth potential. At that time, shares of GameStop were trading at around $45; on Monday, the stock closed at $280.
