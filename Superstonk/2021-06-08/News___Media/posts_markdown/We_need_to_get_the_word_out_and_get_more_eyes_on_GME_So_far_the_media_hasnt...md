**TL:DR I have now registered my song, The Tendieman, to be played on the radio. I am in contact with a fellow ape (** u/HelloYouBeautiful **) who has contacted radio stations AROUND THE WORLD to play this song for all to hear on Wednesday 6/9 (P.S. He and I have a non-monetized agreement). BUT this is where I need a hand. We need people to contact these stations telling them that YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE TENDIEMAN. We can only convince the stations to play the song initially. Contact info, times, and radio stations will be listed at the bottom of this post. You can also call in to your own local stations and request they play The Tendieman as well. More calls = higher chance of it being played.**

I made The Tendieman ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oI\_8YG6Vs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oI_8YG6Vs)) during the warm up squeeze back in late January. It gained a lot of traction around the world and brought a lot of eyes to this wonderful stock. Since then, large media outlets have been trying to lead the average person astray, citing their years of expertise and knowledge of the market. As an average Joe, you'd have no reason to think they're wrong. But we all know THEY ARE and they are deliberately skirting around the whole truth so that their sponsors can make more money.

SO, to help spread the truth or at least bring more of the public's eyes on this, I will be submitting The Tendieman to radio stations around the world to play on the day of the shareholder's meeting. Not all of the stations we've contacted were keen to play it BUT YOU CAN STILL REQUEST THIS SONG FROM YOUR LOCAL RADIO STATION. The more requests, the more likely they will play it. @ them on Twitter with #Tendieman and maybe we can get it trending!

**Kiss FM 104.7 (maybe 104.1) Alabama & Georgia - (Played 5 times at some point throughout the day)**

This station covers a very large area in both Alabama and Georgia. From Atlanta to Montgomery, check it out if you're in the area!

\*These guys weren't very cooperative and didn't give us much information. It may be either of those two stations. But as u/ccolemantcb said, 104.7 is a Christian station so IDK. Their website is also down :/  [**www.kissradio3.com**](https://l.instagram.com/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kissradio3.com%2F&e=ATP70Ee8kLskVPuP7xTD3I7Ff51KbsHbu-vIcfPxChlcldiIqZOFP7V3mE_ocVd2XH72lQih4CH-WKOT93SuZuw&s=1)

Live562 couldn't stop complaining about a certain *bulgarian boy* owned broker, so they agreed to air this at 4:20PM, LA time. Please tune in a bit before, as I've heard some rumours that the DJ has some words he wants to say to you guys. They have also promised to keep the song in rotation the next 5 days (minimum).
