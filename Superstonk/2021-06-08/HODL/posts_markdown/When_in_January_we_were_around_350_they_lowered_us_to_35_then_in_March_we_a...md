# Title: When in January we were around 350 they lowered us to 35, then in March we almost reached 350 and they did the same to us with the dip low to 119 if I remember correctly. Today almost 350 they lowered us to 288. They are running out of gas in their attacks & there’s more apes holding 💎🙌🔥🚀🦍🦾
