Hello everyone, I am guest-guest-hosting Diamantenhände while we all eagerly await u/DerGurkenraspler's glorious return and in u/Parsnip's absence this morning (hopefully they are getting some much deserved rest! ☺️). Apes unite around the world to watch the German market carry the torch until US pre-market opens!

FAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at [https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) and converting to USD in Google.

I'm not trying to permanently take over this tradition, just keep it going for fun on days when u/DerGurkenraspler doesn't start the thread at the normal time. They have been unexpectedly absent recently, but I will gladly bow out of this role when they resume updates.
