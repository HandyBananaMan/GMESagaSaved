    "selftext": "I feel like **$350 at close** is the absolute endgame for hedgies. True, don't place your faith in any dates or numbers however, over the course of the past 5 months, we've got more and more data and are now able to notice certain patterns and trends. Right around the ballpark of $350 (could be $348 or $352 - give or take a few) is where we see a crazy amount of resistance from shorters. Forget about peaking at a really high number for an hour, we are more concerned **at closing at a really high number - above $350.** Margin calls take place after trading hours. Most hedgies have 2-5 days to meet margin requirements and if they fail to do so, it's absolutely game over and they start buying back in, the dominos start to fall and put an unimaginable amount of pressure on Shitadel and other giant hedgies to stay alive. Let's take a look at some dates.\n\n#Reminder: We've never closed above $350 \n\n1/27 - $347 at close ($380 peak)\n\n1/28 - $193 at close ($483 peak)\n\n1/29 - $325 at close ($413 peak) \n\n3/10 - $265 at close ($348 peak)\n\n6/8 - $300 at close ($344 peak) \n\nIt's not a coincidence they absolutely start shitting their pants above $350 and shorting it with everything they have. The only difference between today and Jan/March peaks are the repo agreements which gives hedgies access to fast cash to meet margin requirements (in other words, they are on life support right now unlike back in Jan/March when they didn't need it). The difference for us are the steadily rising support levels. It's not any easily manipulatable gamma spike with paperhands selling early anymore. There's a solid support line for us to keep their shorts from sending us back down to $40 again. In March, the effectiveness of their shorts weakened from tanking the price from 90% to just 50%. Today, it was a sub 20% drop. Their shorts are becoming less and less effective as the price continues trending upwards on utterly miniscule volume. Tick tock hedgies.  Sooner or later we'll close above $350. \n\nOnce again, don't place any hope on certain dates or numbers as we've already seen too many come and go, however closing above $350 is just too interesting to ignore. It might be your final chance to buy in. \n\n#tl;dr: HEDGIES R FUKT",
