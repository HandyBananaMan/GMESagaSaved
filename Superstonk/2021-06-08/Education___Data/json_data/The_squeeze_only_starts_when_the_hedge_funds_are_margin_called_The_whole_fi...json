    "selftext": "The first to be margin called (and eventually liquidated to cover their shorts when they fail to meet margin requirements) are the hedge funds... \n\n**They\u2019re the small fish.** This might cause the price to go into the thousands. **The media will put them on blast hoping we believe that once all the hedge funds are margin called that it\u2019s over**... but this is where it just begins...\n\n**Next will be the market makers and prime brokers** who\u2019ve been \u201coperational shorting\u201d to \u201cprovide liquidity to the market.\u201d As Wes Christian has explained, these are the big fish, the real mother fuckers. This is Citadell, Bank of America, JP Morgan, etc. They\u2019re given privileges to short ETFs, fail to deliver, hide shorts/ fails with options, and to skim profits off retail by front running orders, and used these privileges to collude with hedge funds to manipulate prices by diluting the shares in circulation. \n\nThis is where we could see the price go into the hundreds of thousands....\n\nBut it still ain\u2019t over...\n\n**Next in line to cover would be the Clearing Houses (collectively the DTCC).**\nThey\u2019ve been allowing all this to occur because they profit off all that sweet liquidity. \n\n**This is what they\u2019ve been wanting to avoid and why the FUD/ bots/ shills leading up to this point will seem like a light seasoning compared to the avalanche we\u2019ll see the closer we get to this point.**\n\nWhen the DTCC has to start shelling out, that\u2019s when the price could go into the millions/ tens of millions.\n\n**And then the final boss would be the Fed.** And don\u2019t think for a minute their hands are clean of the blood of the innocent that has been shed by this predatory naked short scheme. \n\nExpect fuckery at every step of the way, and don\u2019t expect all margin calls to happen in one seamless stream; their goal is to never cover. They will try to drag this thing out and shake as many paper hands as possible.\n\nEdit: u/Upper_Piano1809 made a [great point ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nv3r0i/the_squeeze_only_starts_when_the_hedge_funds_are/h13x6h9/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;amp;amp;context=3) that everyone, especially new apes need to know:\n\nCitadell is not just a hedgefund. It is conglomerate with multiple beaches. They\u2019re also a self-clearing market maker. \n\n\u201c I can already see it. \u2018Shitadel has covered it\u2019s short positions the redditors have won the game had ended\u2019 FUD article and potential fake flash crash to scare off the paper hands and gullible baby apes if there are still any though I highly doubt it after these six tough months of Moon Camp. they\u2019re going to want to deploy this when **Shitadel HEDGE FUND (just one \u2018arm\u2019 of the conglomerate Shitadel is)**  covers. When in reality that\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s **Shitadel SECURITIES A.K.A the BIGGEST MARKET MAKER in the world who\u2019s doing the synthetic counterfeit predatory shorting** and that\u2019s the real Pi\u00f1ata we apes are here for. But it doesn\u2019t end there...\u201d\n\n\n^(I posted this as a comment and was encouraged to make it a post for visibility.)\n\n^(Edit: distinguished margin call from liquidation)",
