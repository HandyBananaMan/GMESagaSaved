#Title: The poster discrediting the 0% 40 Billion dollar 4 week bond is FUD and the last time it hit 0% was at the bottom of the Covid crash.

There is a poster spamming posts that amount to "Chill out it's nothing", so far counting 33 comments between the largest submissions on the sub. 

Their proof is linking to the general boilerplate website where the things they say are technically correct. 4 week bonds are offered every Thursday, 40 Bil sold is the recent average, and the interest has been incredibly low the past few weeks. This is correct BUT incredibly misleading and any explanation past those points have been ignored or brushed off. 

So I looked at every announcement since Jan 2019 and shit's fucked yo.

Just glancing at 2019 shows that:

With sales averaging 40-60 Billion dollars per week with some dips to the 30's

**We see pretty steady decline in interest rate for these pretty low tier bonds in 2019 but 2020 is where the fun begins**

Jan - Feb was very consistent, much more than 2019 as a whole with Max interest staying around 1.5% and Volume between 30-50Bil sales.

Then the Crash happened

Some more silliness happens between April -> June where interest swings between 0.090% and .190% but volume explodes to between 70-90 Bil sales every 4 weeks.

![June 11th 2020 0.130% 70 Bill sales](https://imgur.com/KRzjhbh)  

Volume then drops gradually until late July where they stay stagnant at 0.070%-0.090% and exactly 30 Bil Sales

2021 has just been sad as these bonds have been slowly dying starting at 0.080% they have been dropping every week consistently until we hit 0.000% today. Volume stayed at exactly 30 Bil sales from Jan -> March 11th then switching to exactly 40 Bil sales every time till today.

**Conclusion**  

The volume isn't what's alarming, yet, the ***interest*** is. For years the interest for these Bonds have been declining, then Covid body slammed them into the ground where the last time we had Zero Coupon Bonds was at the bottom of the covid crash. They then recovered for a bit after. But so far they have been slowly walking towards their death since January and we now see Zero Coupon Bonds that were auctioned off today. What does this mean? Nothing good I believe. 

Edit:   
With the exception of March 26th this is what happens to 4 week bonds after they hit 0% since 08
