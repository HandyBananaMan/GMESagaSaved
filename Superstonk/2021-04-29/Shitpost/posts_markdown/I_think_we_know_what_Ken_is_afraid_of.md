There are 14,000 call contracts between here and $200. That's 1,400,000 shares that need to be bought/hedged (minus what they've already hedged). There's another 20,000 contracts between $200 and $300. That's 2,000,000 shares that need to be bought/hedged.  
  
TL;DR What's behind $180? A motherfucking greased waterslide to a margin call, that's what.
