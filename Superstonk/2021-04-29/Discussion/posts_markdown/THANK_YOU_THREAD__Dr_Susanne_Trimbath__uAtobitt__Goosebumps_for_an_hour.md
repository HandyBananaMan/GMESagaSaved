I just want to thank all the mods and contributors and Dr. Trimbath for an amazing interview.  You could see Dr. Trimbath's relief at finding some allies and "being believed" -- when Atobitt mentioned there are 250,000 apes gathering their pitchforks like she'd always wanted, she looked like she was about to cry!

Whoever helped with the YT channel and chyrons, that shit was on point.  Tremendous work all-around, everybody!

u/Atobitt: THEM NUMBERS ARE FUCKING *INSANE*, DUDE!!! Looking forward to House of Cards II, holy fucking shit
