<h1>Title: Just called DEGIRO. They've been so swamped with GameStop requests they are working on a "common platform solution" to let all DEGIRO GME shareholders vote. Proud of you Europoors!</h1>

<p>I called DEGIRO customer service right now to inquire how can I vote my shares ahead of the annual meeting. The customer service guy was very nice, but it was clear as day he's been swamped with this question before (the "Oooohhh yeah GameStop" reaction). </p>
<p>He said they have an inflow of requests from GME shareholders about voting and "are working with their brokerage department to come up with a common platform for all customers to vote." Because apparently there have been so many requests lately, they are unable to handle them individually. </p>
<p>The guy said they could not give a date when it would be ready, but they will get back to me as soon as they have "the solution." </p>
<p>The good: Europoors are responsible HODLers and are voting their shares en masse!</p>
<p>The bad: DEGIRO could be bulshitting and delaying or trying to avoid us voting altogether. Although I don't think that's likely, they have been a fairly good broker so far. No PFOF, no restrictions buying in January, although they do wire trades to Shitadel darkpool.</p>
<p>Good job, Europoors. We are voting like responsible HODLers should! üíéüëê</p>
