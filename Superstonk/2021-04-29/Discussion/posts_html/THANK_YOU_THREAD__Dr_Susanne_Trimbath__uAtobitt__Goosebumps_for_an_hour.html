<p>I just want to thank all the mods and contributors and Dr. Trimbath for an amazing interview.  You could see Dr. Trimbath's relief at finding some allies and "being believed" -- when Atobitt mentioned there are 250,000 apes gathering their pitchforks like she'd always wanted, she looked like she was about to cry!</p>
<p>Whoever helped with the YT channel and chyrons, that shit was on point.  Tremendous work all-around, everybody!</p>
<p>u/Atobitt: THEM NUMBERS ARE FUCKING <em>INSANE</em>, DUDE!!! Looking forward to House of Cards II, holy fucking shit</p>
