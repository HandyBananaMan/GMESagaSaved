They will be paying cash to rid themselves of debt, this is insanely bullish. \n\nHere's the link to the official annoucement: [Gamestop Announces Voluntary Early Redemption](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes-0)\n\nAfter tomorrow, when the debts have been paid, the company is legally allowed to discuss partnerships and plans for the future, so buckle up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust a quick side note to everyone. \n\nRemember, we've seen a lot of price action on GME, A LOT of price action. We've seen swings of literally hundreds of dollars on random days, we've seen volume dry up faster than my girlfriends entry hole, we've seen the MSM attack Gamestop relentlessly. Yet we're still sideways trading at $170+. \n\nGamestop hasn't really released any information about their plans or future ideas. Gamestop has given the least amount of information possible and yet we're still at way over $150 per share. Gamestop just released 3.5 million shares on to the market without ANYONE knowing! Patience my young apes, patience and we will be rewarded.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRockets Rockets Rockets\n\nDiamonds Diamonds Diamonds\n\nApes Apes Apes",
