If anything, we keep gaining motivation every day that the MOASS doesn't happen. It gives us times to get our ape paychecks and buy more stocks. \n\nThe MOASS can happen today, next week or even in a few months. Who knows. But what I do know is that it will happen. It's only a matter of time.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT #1\n\nAs I said, NOBODY lost motivation. Read the comments to see clearly. The shills are the ones trying to say differently. \n\nNon of this is financial advice. I sniff red crayons.\n\n\n\nEDIT #2\n\nLook at all the reinforcement from the apes here!! It doesn't stop!",
    "title": "Stop saying people are losing motivation and claiming \"conspiracy theories\". This is exactly what the shills want us to say. NOBODY HAS LOST MOTIVATION. LOOK AT SELL ORDERS. NOONE IS SELLING. I REPEAT ALL APES ARE STILL STRONG IN THE GAME!",
