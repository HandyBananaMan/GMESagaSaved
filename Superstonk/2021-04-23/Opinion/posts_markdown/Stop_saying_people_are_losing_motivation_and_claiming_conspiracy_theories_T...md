We won't stop. We can't stop. This is GameStop. Stop playing the role that the shills want you to play. 

Stop saying we are losing motivation. None of us are. If anything, we keep gaining motivation every day that the MOASS doesn't happen. It gives us times to get our ape paychecks and buy more stocks. 

The MOASS can happen today, next week or even in a few months. Who knows. But what I do know is that it will happen. It's only a matter of time.




EDIT #1

As I said, NOBODY lost motivation. Read the comments to see clearly. The shills are the ones trying to say differently. 

Non of this is financial advice. I sniff red crayons.



EDIT #2

Look at all the reinforcement from the apes here!! It doesn't stop!
