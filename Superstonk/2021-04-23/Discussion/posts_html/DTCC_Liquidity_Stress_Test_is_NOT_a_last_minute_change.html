<p>I started trying to correct individual posts and got sick of it so here it is:</p>
<p>The DTCC Liquidity Stress Test for next week was not <em>"suddenly changed"</em> or "<em>no notice".</em> They literally announced it two months ago. <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/2/22/GOV1051-21.pdf">https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/2/22/GOV1051-21.pdf</a></p>
<p>For frack sake people stop acting like a bunch of coked up apes at every rumor you hear and check that it's actually true before running around screaming <strong>"conspiracy"</strong> at every little thing. The damn media gives us enough coked up misinformation bullshit we don't need to add to the mountains of crap ourselves.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias is a hella of drug so don't get addicted to it.</p>
<p>(I'm adding this text from a reply I gave below, because I think it summarizes my concerns better.)</p>
<p>It's not just wrong, it's so easily refutable that it's like <em>conspicuously</em> wrong. I don't mean to say that the original poster or the folks rushing to agree are shills or shit-posters. I think they just found something that seemed to confirm their biases and ran with it before checking whether what they were claiming was true or not.</p>
<p>When stuff like that is at the top of the reddit it can hurt GME precisely <em>because</em> it's so easily refuted. People who bother to check, like I did, might be turned off and walk away if they find lots of easily debunked DD getting thousands and tens of thousands of upvotes and cheerleading comments. If apes want more people to climb on this rocket apes can't champion wildly incorrect information that might scare off anyone with the ability to do a simple google search.</p>
<p>I'm all for the RAH-RAH cheerleading and even find most of the shitposting and memes really entertaining. But when it comes to DD apes have to do a better job sticking with facts and not calling everyone who disagrees paperhands and shills.(end additional text)</p>
<p>~~Could the change of dates mean something? Sure. Does it have to mean something? No. The only facts we know is that it's a different date and that they announced it literally 2 months ago, not yesterday.~~ (Edit 3: There is no change of dates they have done this in April or May just about as often as they have done it in August. There is literally nothing unusual about this. It merely falls into a time-frame we are already excited about so we want to make this into a "thing"... Zhu Li, this is not "a thing".)</p>

<p>And please, like I said elsewhere; stop acting like a Q-anon idiot sniffing his own farts and becoming convinced that the "<em>cabal"</em> is trying to poison him.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p>
<p>Edit 2: Another user u/Harris714 found previous April testing. This is really not unusual. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mww2ah/dtcc_planning_liquidity_risk_testing_on_26th/gvl8bwj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mww2ah/dtcc_planning_liquidity_risk_testing_on_26th/gvl8bwj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>

<p>Edit 4: Changed some wording to be a little less... ummm <em>bombastic</em> I guess. And include some text from a reply I give below as to why we need to be careful about this stuff.</p>
<p>***Also obligatory not financial advise.</p>
