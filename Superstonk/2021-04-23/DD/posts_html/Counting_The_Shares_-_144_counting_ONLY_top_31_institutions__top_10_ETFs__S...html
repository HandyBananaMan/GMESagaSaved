<p>Total for top 31 HODLers: <strong>66,201,800</strong> shares.</p>
<p>There were more listed but the values were too low to even matter for me to bother calculating at this point. If the data is accurate it's like another 2 or 3 million shares roughly just eyeballing the list.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Top 10 Funds:</strong></p>
<p>iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF: <strong>3,645,620</strong></p>
<p>Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund: <strong>1,473,607</strong></p>

<p>Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund: <strong>506,537</strong></p>
<p>iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF: <strong>472,273</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Bringing the grand total to <strong>78,579,550</strong></p>
<p>That's just for the top 31 HODLers + the top 10 ETFs.</p>
<p>78,579,550 - 70,771,778 = <strong>7,807,772 extra</strong> shares.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Adding in DFV: 200k shares = <strong>8,007,772 extra</strong> shares.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs as of April 1st lists 900k shares according to</p>
<p><img alt="https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-resources/full-portfolio-holdings/small-cap-equity-insights-holdings.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n" src="https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-resources/full-portfolio-holdings/small-cap-equity-insights-holdings.pdf?sa=n&amp;rd=n" /></p>
<p>("Per end date" 1/31/2021 but pdf says still good as of April 1st. They also own 12m of AMC for some reason)</p>
<p>That's <strong>8,907,772</strong> shares.</p>
<p>JP Morgan France as of December 2020 annual report (But page indexed in April which could mean they still hold) lists 900k shares according to:</p>
<p>A fundsquare.net link on Google but it has some strange identifier codes which I don't want to copy and paste. Just type in Google: <strong>"gamestop" "Security Description"-gamestop.com after:2021-01-01</strong> you'll see a PDF somewhere on the first page</p>
<p>That's <strong>9,807,772</strong> <strong>extra</strong> shares.</p>
<p>Someone did a poll in Superstonk recently, I'm sorry I can't find your username, pm me if you want credit but they said they estimate Superstonk alone has 25 million shares.</p>
<p>That's <strong>34,807,772 extra</strong> shares.</p>
<p>Should we keep going?  Just using the top 31 HODLers + top 10 ETFs + Superstonk alone, we're at <strong>113,387,322</strong> shares when there's only supposed to be <strong>70,771,778</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>There. Is. No. Float.</em></strong></p>
<p>We're already at 144%. Not counting the rest of the institutions, the rest of the ETFs, insider holdings, and don't forget there are <strong>OTHER COUNTRIES</strong> in the world... Not counting all the other millions of apes with hands of diamond.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR Only counting top 31 HODLers + top 10 ETFs + recently polled Superstonk ownership, the ownership percentage is at 144%. Every available share is synthetic. At the rate they've been going, we literally could be at 20x to 50x the shares.</strong></p>
<p>Edit: I am just ape who eats and also snortd crayons so I could be off on any of this information and I think just continuing this path of finding the shares is healthy for apes who like to do something while waiting for tendies.</p>
