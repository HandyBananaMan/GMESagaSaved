If the data is accurate it's like another 2 or 3 million shares roughly just eyeballing the list.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Top 10 Funds:**\n\niShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF: **3,645,620**\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund: **1,473,607**\n\nMorgan Stanley Institutional Small Co.

They also own 12m of AMC for some reason)\n\nThat's **8,907,772** shares.\n\nJP Morgan France as of December 2020 annual report (But page indexed in April which could mean they still hold) lists 900k shares according to:\n\nA fundsquare.net link on Google but it has some strange identifier codes which I don't want to copy and paste. Just type in Google: **\"gamestop\" \"Security Description\"-gamestop.com after:2021-01-01** you'll see a PDF somewhere on the first page\n\nThat's **9,807,772** **extra** shares.\n\nSomeone did a poll in Superstonk recently, I'm sorry I can't find your username, pm me if you want credit but they said they estimate Superstonk alone has 25 million shares.\n\nThat's **34,807,772 extra** shares.\n\nShould we keep going?  Just using the top 31 HODLers + top 10 ETFs + Superstonk alone, we're at **113,387,322** shares when there's only supposed to be **70,771,778**\n\n***There. Is. No. Float.***\n\nWe're already at 144%. Not counting the rest of the institutions, the rest of the ETFs, insider holdings, and don't forget there are **OTHER COUNTRIES** in the world... Not counting all the other millions of apes with hands of diamond.\n\n**TL;DR Only counting top 31 HODLers + top 10 ETFs + recently polled Superstonk ownership, the ownership percentage is at 144%. Every available share is synthetic. At the rate they've been going, we literally could be at 20x to 50x the shares.**\n\nEdit: I am just ape who eats and also snortd crayons so I could be off on any of this information and I think just continuing this path of finding the shares is healthy for apes who like to do something while waiting for tendies.",
