I set out to find the shares.

**Institutional:**

Piecing information from the following websites and attempting to show accurate data according to latest filing dates in each by googling the "company name + **13F gme**"**:**

Total for top 31 HODLers: **66,201,800** shares.

There were more listed but the values were too low to even matter for me to bother calculating at this point. If the data is accurate it's like another 2 or 3 million shares roughly just eyeballing the list.

&#x200B;

**Top 10 Funds:**

iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF: **3,645,620**

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund: **1,473,607**

Morgan Stanley Institutional Small Co. Inception Portfolio: **1,415,967**

iShares Russell 2000 ETF: **1,400,982**

Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund: **1,277,399**

Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund: **773,337**

Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund: **769,302**

iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF: **642,726**

Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund: **506,537**

iShares S&P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF: **472,273**

&#x200B;

Bringing the grand total to **78,579,550**

That's just for the top 31 HODLers + the top 10 ETFs.

78,579,550 - 70,771,778 = **7,807,772 extra** shares.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Adding in DFV: 200k shares = **8,007,772 extra** shares.

&#x200B;

Goldman Sachs as of April 1st lists 900k shares according to

![https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-resources/full-portfolio-holdings/small-cap-equity-insights-holdings.pdf?sa=n&rd=n](https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-resources/full-portfolio-holdings/small-cap-equity-insights-holdings.pdf?sa=n&rd=n)

("Per end date" 1/31/2021 but pdf says still good as of April 1st. They also own 12m of AMC for some reason)

That's **8,907,772** shares.

JP Morgan France as of December 2020 annual report (But page indexed in April which could mean they still hold) lists 900k shares according to:

A fundsquare.net link on Google but it has some strange identifier codes which I don't want to copy and paste. Just type in Google: **"gamestop" "Security Description"-gamestop.com after:2021-01-01** you'll see a PDF somewhere on the first page

That's **9,807,772** **extra** shares.

Someone did a poll in Superstonk recently, I'm sorry I can't find your username, pm me if you want credit but they said they estimate Superstonk alone has 25 million shares.

That's **34,807,772 extra** shares.

Should we keep going?  Just using the top 31 HODLers + top 10 ETFs + Superstonk alone, we're at **113,387,322** shares when there's only supposed to be **70,771,778**

***There. Is. No. Float.***

We're already at 144%. Not counting the rest of the institutions, the rest of the ETFs, insider holdings, and don't forget there are **OTHER COUNTRIES** in the world... Not counting all the other millions of apes with hands of diamond.

**TL;DR Only counting top 31 HODLers + top 10 ETFs + recently polled Superstonk ownership, the ownership percentage is at 144%. Every available share is synthetic. At the rate they've been going, we literally could be at 20x to 50x the shares.**

Edit: I am just ape who eats and also snortd crayons so I could be off on any of this information and I think just continuing this path of finding the shares is healthy for apes who like to do something while waiting for tendies.
