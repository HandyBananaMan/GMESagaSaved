Hello fellow apes,

Welcome to my 3^(rd) Day of live charting since u/WardenElite took his leave of absence (he is missed). I'm gonna be a bit slow today since I was up till 4am reading and re-reading GMEs proxy statement.

On the subject of streaming. Looks like I'll give Monday a shot I'm pretty confidant that I can handle both at this point.  This is a link to my YT if you guys want to subscribe for notifications [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmgi8psSbIWiSR2tefHbug](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmgi8psSbIWiSR2tefHbug).

Historical Resistance/Support:

116.5, 125.5, 132.5, 141, 145, 147.5, **150**, 152.5, 156.5, 158.5, 162.5, 163, 165.5, 172, 174, 176.5, 179, 180.5, 182, 183.5, 184.5, 186, 187.5, 190.5, 192, 195, 196.5, 197.5, **200**, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, 226, 230, 234, 243, 250, 253, 256

# End of Day Wrap-up

So it looks like we closed the day on a nice uptrend again, some sell pressure from people not wanting to hold the position over the weekend kept us below that 152.50 resistance.Tiny battle on the last candle to keep us from closing positive but the bulls won

**Closing Price of 151.20 up 0.02% for the day on 3.94m Volume.** 

Honestly I expected more action anybody holding lottery tickets (0DTE) calls they bought this morning did well if they sold during that big uptrend around 2pm EST. 

So Some information about the pokeball, it is not exact science it looks like we dropped out of mine but I've looked back at warden's and his endpoint is further out. I prefer to draw my indicators more conservatively. This really just means that we are in a "zone" so to speak where we can expect higher than normal volatility. 

IV is super low (this is good) going into next week I will be looking at open interest on options this coming Monday to determine any upcoming options plays. 

Additionally the coming week we may see institutions setting up to recall their shares for the upcoming meeting. There is no way to tell when this will happen. But a word for my fellow apes if you have not yet called your broker to determine if your shares are being lent out do so now. Do not fall prey to the bysatnder effect assuming someone else will do it or "I only have x shares), you are an owner of a business it is your responsibility, nay, duty to vote your shares so please make sure your shares are in your account to vote on June 9th.

Lastly Monday morning I will begin streaming as I believe the MOASS is approaching in the near future and being able to relay live updates in the run up to that is of great importance to this community. My YouTube can be found at the top of this post and on my profile.

Again, Thank you for all the kind words and support for those of you that have rallied behind me. I had big shoes to fill and didn't feel entirely confident in doing so. So your support has meant more to me than you know. 

Till Monday Apes!!!

Weakness here we will probably close above VWAP but below the 152-153.5 resistance.

Looking for this test to carry us to close

**Edit 57 3:28**

I know some people disagree with me using iborrowdesk, but I just use it as a gauge of the short positions. They have used up quite a lot of shares today. If we have an upward move I highly doubt they will be able to put much reverse pressure on it.

**Edit 56 3:22**

So without volume it will break down as seen here

https://preview.redd.it/1a2r6rtd4zu61.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=824656c3fc97d4b9a3c856989c2121f00c0ca47c

**Edit 55 3:18**

This is looking like a strong reversion coming into the last 30. If volume comes in we are gonna move again

**Edit 54 3:04**

Looking for a bounce here. we could drop back down to VWAP though. Volume =low

**Edit 51 2:41**

Retesting resistance sell wall of 2000 at 153.5, GME needs to get through that for more upside action

**Edit 50 2:39**

Changed flair to DD now that we are over 2500 words. We have kind of low visibility apparently maybe people could reach out to the mod team to get this pinned. Please don't DM them.

**Edit 49 2:33**

Looking at these 2 trends right now

**Edit 48 2:30**

Small bearish breakdown , best to stay above 150 and break out of this trend to the upside

https://preview.redd.it/eat7px16vyu61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=4110a8d2ef002e8408dd805ad7ea0e5b60999cd5

**Edit 46 2:20**

Looks like from 150-160 we could hit a small gamma ramp lots of open calls in that range

**Edit 45 2:16**

Turn around and Re-Test still looks bullish. up .22% on the day

https://preview.redd.it/c4igyjbwsyu61.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ce02047af3a17a9d4c7b8c296ff9276083333e4

**Edit 44 2:10**

326k on that move, let's consolidate a little and see who else wants some stocks.

**Edit 43 2:07**

Next test 156.50

**Edit 42 2:05**

Look at them trying to hold us back, don't they know apes are four times stronger than an average human.

**Edit 41 2:04**

**AND** HERE COMES THE FOMO!

**Edit 40 2:00**

This is actually a great retest of 150. Volume, check, breakout, check. Strap in apes.

**Edit 39 1:59**

Look at me now

**Edit 37 1:52**

Little consolidation wedge/bull pennant. Probably break up.

https://preview.redd.it/x6llhqbgoyu61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3447e5b65c7a6f4cb5517ee03b2eca48d0335e0

**Edit 36 1:34**

We still need another test of 150 if we want to see some movement. Volume still low. This is were we stand

https://preview.redd.it/ase9tzzblyu61.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=899004cbf81ad4c0b75070baf9ad12e40b982fc4

**Edit 35 1:15**

From Investopedia. **The Carly Rae Indicator**: Formed off an intraday quasi-cup & handle pattern on the one minute time chart. The Carly Rae is known for launching apes through previously unheard of resistance levels. But like most pop stars she is low on volume. She's a fickle bitch, but she's bullish AF. /s

**Edit 34 1:04**

Carly Rae Jepson Technical Indicator confirmed!

https://preview.redd.it/mxzba2iufyu61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=5554733956a0c5bd98675d4f346d8e269072b9fa

**Edit 33 12:56**

Carly Rae Jepsen's song "Call me Maybe" keeps playing in my head except the lyrics are "buy me maybe". I don't know if this is a technical indicator or not, stay tuned.

**Edit 32 12:50**

This is the begging of a bullish trend as you can see we didn't even fully retest VWAP before moving up more. Still needs more volume.

**Edit 31 12:38**

If you like the stock at $250 you should absolutely love it at 148.16

**Edit 30 12:31**

This is called a mean reversion the stock wants to be above VWAP

**Edit 29 12:27**

Look at this little tiny short volume used to push us below VWAP

**Edit 28 12:13**

Another test of VWAP hope we bounce if not expect a dip.

**Edit 27 12:10**

I just wanna say thanks for all of you flooding in here to support me. We really are strong together. I'm here to fling shit, draw dicks on charts, help sick kids and animals, and fuk hedges. All I hope is that your tits are as jacked as mine. I love watching this thing move sideways!

**Edit 26 12:05**

Docotor, I can't get my stock up. It's just laying there doing nothing.

[Limp Stonk](https://preview.redd.it/5sisp3qa5yu61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c01167e42293da8430519f64cf44e843c2359752)

**Edit 25 12:00**

Looks like decent consolidation for a move soon, this stock likes to move during lunch hours for some reason. Here's were I'm looking for the breakout to test 150.

&#x200B;

**Edit 24 11:50**

So I'm getting a lot of messages regarding the day trading of this stock. This stock is heavily day traded since we hodl, and don't sell and the shorts push the price down every morning, we have become super predictable in our pattern. I pretty much expect any initial climb in the day to be a point were day traders take profit at a resistance level. It's not a lot of volume and rarely a big deal, as the people with enough capital to profitably day trade GME are few and far between. Hope this clears up some confusion or creates more...

**Edit 23 11:45**

Weak test of 150 maybe a triple top. We might return to VWAP and bounce to test again. I expect a small dip and a reversion.

**Edit 22 11:30**

Looks like some day traders took their gains. Not a cause for concern.

**Edit 21 11:25**

**Edit 20 11:23**

35,000 shares to borrow (Short), looks like the rate went up a little 1.13%. Also looks like the SPY is getting ready to retest that all time high.

**Edit 19 11:17**

As always be careful with FOMO, this stock loves bull traps. Fintel has crashed. Interesting. Enjoy the uptrend.

**Edit 18 11:15**

Dear Diary,

My first date with VWAP went ok we will probably hang out again.

**Edit 17 11:07**

Well we broke through VWAP this is a good sign RSI is a bit overextended but hopefully we stay above while we consolidate.

**Edit 16 11:02**

Looking a little more bullish in our testing of VWAP. Higher highs, lower lows but still no volume.

**Edit 15 10:46**

If we continue this uptrend after this dogi we could break through.

**Edit 14 10:40**

Looks like this is our channel till some further price action happens. The last time it was this low we had that big spike on the 14th so we know this is a level where long whales are willing to buy in.

**Edit 13 10:28**

Here is where we stand on the pokeball as of now. I'm gonna try and answer a few questions while we are slow.

**Edit 12 10:25**

Looks like we might be between 145 and 147 for a minute till we break through VWAP

**Edit 11 10:20**

I still want VWAP to act as support, and it looks like we are getting rejected again.

**Edit 10 10:18**

Bounce on the 145 support, RSI picking up

**Edit 9 10:05**

Hey Kenny how are the kids? No seriously this drop is a little volume weighted so I assume short shares, some day traders playing the premarket gap up and a stop loss or 2.

145 and 141 are the support levels where I'm looking for a bounce. If there is a recall we could be in for a rough day as they try to drive the price lower before they cover.

**Edit 8 10:02**

Dropped through that support heading lower for now. 99 problems, but hodlin' isn't one.

**Edit 7 10:00**

Let's see if we can follow this trendline up and test VWAP, otherwise low volume more chop.

617.66k trade so far today.

**Edit 6 9:46**

Nope more dip

**Edit 5 9:45**

Much better volume this morning vs. yesterday. Fintel is not updating it's short shares available, as well as IborrowDesk. Honestly I feel like this usually predicates a bigger move on GME as it means all shares are borrowed also and increase in rate as MM make more synth shares.

**Edit 4 9:40**

Morning dip\* Test of 147.5 maybe?

**Edit 3 9:39**

Wedge update on the 4-hour Chart

**Edit 2 9:35**

Volume picking up, there is just no sell pressure. Maybe there is no point in shorting if the shares are gonna recalled? IborrowDesk shows 500k shares to borrow @ 1.1%. Moving right into our pokeball.

**Edit 1 9:33**

Nice opening candlesticks start of an uptrend. Ok volume low 149 high 151.13 let's see where it takes us.

# Premarket Analysis

Looks like we had a tiny gap up @ 4am which was quickly filled. Low volume, but I'm excited for today.
