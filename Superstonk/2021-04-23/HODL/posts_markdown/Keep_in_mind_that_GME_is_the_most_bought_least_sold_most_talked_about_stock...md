 So the only reason it hasn't squeezed yet is not due to any selling but solely to all the shorting. Pure, unadulterated shorting from billion-dollar HFs. That's the only reason we aren't on Pluto yet. 

**THEY CAN'T KEEP THIS UP FOREVER, BUT WE CAN HODL FOREVER. FOR AS LONG AS IT FUCKING TAKES.**

You've been poor your whole life. You can wait a few more months.

 Always go back to these 4 simple rules:

1. The price is academic
2. It's only a loss if you sell
3. **Shorts must cover**
4. Hold until ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Everything else is noise.

I will post this once a day to keep spirits up and heads in the game.

Everyone and his brother knows Ryan Cohen is turning Gamestop's business model completely around from a brick and mortar retailer into an online retailer with similarities to amazon and steam.

Everyone in the world knows new, fresh talented skill is being hired for key positions to effect this change. Everything about GME is coming up roses, and yet the stock continues to fall.

What does that tell you besides that fact that evil HFs that STILL wanna see the company die out are stubbornly refusing to give up the fight and cut their losses?

**SO I SAY WE STUBBORNLY REFUSE TO SELL, REFUSE TO QUIT HODLING, AND JUST BITE DOWN HARDER AND NEVER LET GO!!!**

**WE WIN THIS BY BEING PATIENT!!! GO OUTSIDE AND DO SOMETHING FUN! TAKE YOUR MIND OFF THE STOCK TICKER! IT'LL BE A WHILE YET, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY WON!!!**
