<h1>Title: A Visual Analysis 'V2' showing Catalysts alongside the 21 day FTD Cycle. This has other improvements thanks to apes providing feedback yesterday - I shall celebrate by eating some crayons. FYI - We did not cross the lower side of the bull pennant yesterday. No dates - just lines &amp; triangles.</h1>
