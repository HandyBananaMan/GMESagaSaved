<p>TL;DR: Credit Suisse is in a shit position and has lost over 10 Billion dollars since the start of the year. If the liquidity crisis occurs, Credit Suisse might be one of the first to go.</p>
<p>During the first half of 2021 Credit Suisse has been embroiled in a series of scandals centred on the collapse of <strong>Archegos</strong> and <strong>Greensill Capital.</strong> These events have generated billions of dollars in losses, caused a major political scandal in the UK and has triggered the departure of multiple senior staff across Credit Suisse, including the retirement of the Chairman of the board.</p>
<p>In consequence of the collapse of Archegos, Credit Suisse alone has lost in excess of <strong>$5,500,000,000.</strong> Due to Archegos’s Bill Hwang cycling margin loan profits back into his positions, the losses so far realised on Archegos will not be recovered because Hwang never had the money in the first place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in consequence of the collapse of Greensill, Credit Suisse, from an approximately <strong>$10,000,000,000</strong> exposure has so far only managed to return <strong>$5,900,000,000</strong> to investors, with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-unit-blacklisted-gupta-062540352.html"><strong>$4,100,000,000 owing</strong>.</a> The vast majority of this unrecovered loss on Greensill is owed from Anglo-Australian mining magnate Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance, owners of Liberty Steel, Whyalla Steel, and Tahmoor Coal, among others. Gupta has stated repeatedly he will fight tooth and nail to avoid paying this, making any further recovery of the monies owed difficult and costly in time and litigation.</p>
<p>The combined losses across Credit Suisse’s Archegos positions and exposure to Greensill thus totals approximately <strong>$9,600,000,000</strong>. It has also been reported that the Archegos bleeding has not yet stopped, with Suisse still holding undisclosed positions for Archegos, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-taps-investors-for-cash-after-archegos-loss-widens-11619070830">having only closed <strong>“97%”</strong> of holdings</a> .Naturally, speculation, currently with zero supporting evidence, has jumped to a GameStop connection, with Archegos’ collapse having coincided with the price actions in January through March. Importantly, there does not need to be any correlation between Archegos, Greensill, or GameStop for Suisse to already be in a fucked situation going into the coming storm.</p>
<p>In the latest developments on the Credit Suisse front, another fund associated with Credit Suisse, called <strong>Renaissance Alternative Access Fund</strong>, has barred its investors from withdrawing cash. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-rentech-fund-holds-171031560.html"><strong>The fund was locked this month, after the value of the fund fell from $700,000,000 to $250,000,000, a loss of $450,000,000</strong></a>. Investors in the fund will be able to receive 95% of their investments 2 months from now, but in the meantime the fund’s withdrawals will be locked.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse has cut staff bonuses, cut share dividends, and tried to raise capital. Liquidity appears to becoming an issue at Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>With the losses at Renaissance added into the Greensill and Archegos losses, Credit Suisse has now lost more than <strong>$10,050,000,000</strong>.</p>
<p>During the event of a liquidity crisis triggered by the collapse of the house of cards, and/or the MOASS (whichever comes first), Credit Suisse is unlikely to be in a position to respond effectively, and may not even survive.</p>
<p>The following is a listing of significant persons who have been publicly reported to have departed Credit Suisse since the Archegos and Greensill situations began. This list uses public information, including LinkedIn profiles and has excluded personal information when encountered. Do not harass or contact these people at all under any circumstances. Not all of these departures, such as those of the Sydney branch, appear to be directly related to anything other than the normal process of personal advancement and/or the inter organisational poaching of talent.</p>
<p>But at this point, who still believes in coincidences?</p>

<p>·  <strong>Ryan Nelson</strong>. I have found no information on this person beyond media reports identifying him as Co Head along with John Dabbs of Prime Brokerage.

No start time or employment history at Suisse could be found, but reported to have been made to quite alongside John Dabbs on April 19th. 2021. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-prime-brokerage-co-heads-to-leave-bank-after-archegos-losses-11618847715">1</a></p>

<p><strong>Eric Varvel.</strong> Head of the asset management that ran the funds. Demoted but not fired.
