From me:

"Dear Nordnet - Please let us vote. listen to your customers and take your responsibility! If we are not able to vote, make an effort to at least vote blank for us so that the vote count goes through!"

**Answer:**

Hi, we are investigating the possibility to register a "non-vote". We will give out information to all shareholders when we have reached a conclusion"

&#x200B;

**How can you help?**

Continue to add pressure. Not to be a big ape d\*\*k, but to help motivate them. Without us, they don't have a company! GO GO GO

Not financial advice!!!

Buy, Hold, Vote!

Edit 1: typo's
