There’s no way around it - this qualifies as fear, uncertainty, and doubt. It should absolutely not be enough FUD to make anyone want out. But I wish we could discuss this, maybe even get some DD on the topic. 

The only answers I’ve seen to this question floating around here are:

1. That can’t happen (no explanation why)
2. The markets would lose all credibility (and... so what? Are people going to use the Mars stock exchange instead? Are you implying it has any credibility right now after reading HoC 2?)


Anyway I am sure I am about to be buried in little blue arrows pointing down but I really wish we could work through this scenario.  Pretty much all the DD has been confirmed up to this point, why are we scared to discuss bullshit outcomes like the government calling a mulligan, or god forbid Jim Cramer’s “just pay everyone 200 a share”

Edit: Not going to respond to every single reply and DM, especially the weird / mean ones.  And yes I'm aware there's more than the NYSE, I use london and frankfurt too, albeit infrequently.  I appreciate all the well thought out replies
