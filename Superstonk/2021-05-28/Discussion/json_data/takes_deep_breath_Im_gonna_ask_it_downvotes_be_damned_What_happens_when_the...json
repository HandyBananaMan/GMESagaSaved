But I wish we could discuss this, maybe even get some DD on the topic. \n\nThe only answers I\u2019ve seen to this question floating around here are:\n\n1. That can\u2019t happen (no explanation why)\n2. The markets would lose all credibility (and... so what? Are people going to use the Mars stock exchange instead? Are you implying it has any credibility right now after reading HoC 2?)\n\n\nAnyway I am sure I am about to be buried in little blue arrows pointing down but I really wish we could work through this scenario.  Pretty much all the DD has been confirmed up to this point, why are we scared to discuss bullshit outcomes like the government calling a mulligan, or god forbid Jim Cramer\u2019s \u201cjust pay everyone 200 a share\u201d\n\nEdit: Not going to respond to every single reply and DM, especially the weird / mean ones.  And yes I'm aware there's more than the NYSE, I use london and frankfurt too, albeit infrequently.  I appreciate all the well thought out replies",
