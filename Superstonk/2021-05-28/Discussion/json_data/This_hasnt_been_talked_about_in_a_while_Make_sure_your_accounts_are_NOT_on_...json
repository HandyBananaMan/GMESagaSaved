    "selftext": "This was a huge topic of discussion months ago but it has kind of died down. \n\nWith so many apes having transferred brokers, I believe that now is an important time for a reminder to call your broker and be sure that your shares are not being lent out giving ammo to shorts.\n\nI was originally on Robinhood but made a transfer months ago to Fidelity. My shares came over on margin and I had to call the have them switched to cash. Last week I enabled level 3 options trading on my Fidelity account and they automatically switched my GME to margin. I had to have them manually switch it back to cash.\n\nFidelity confirmed to me on the phone that *if you have margin enabled on your account in any way, you\u2019re authorizing them to lend your shares* as well as liquidate your holdings to cover any margin calls you may incur from options trading. *It doesn\u2019t matter if your shares are backed by cash or not.*\n\n\nTLDR; Even if you\u2019ve checked in the past, double check with your broker that your shares are not being lent out. Changes to your account could have enabled margin without you even knowing.",
