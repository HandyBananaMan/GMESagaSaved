All of this DD, all of this guidance from experts, all of this attention on this naked short-selling issue... will be for nothing, if we don't vote our shares. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe must vote our shares to show everyone how prolific this issue is. This isn't just a matter of corporate governance, this is about proving to everyone that our investment is being crushed by greedy naked short sellers dumping, potentially, millions and millions of \"Phantom Shares\" into the market. This isn't anything new, as all our AMA guests have said, this problem has been going on for decades in some form or fashion... But this time, the new variable is us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy participating in the vote you are ensuring that every last share that the shorts have fabricated and sold to us is counted. Once their actions see the light of day, in the form of the vote count, this will be the beginning of the end... \n\nThere is no way out for them as long as we all vote our shares. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong or doesn't fully grasp the situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z97v4vwduw171.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5a41df2dc0005242453bbf31e58ecfe2eba73b4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd to those of you who are told by your brokers that you aren't able to vote... make noise, tell them you demand your rights... If you own shares in a company, it is YOUR RIGHT to vote on that companies decisions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**There is proof that this works, as we are receiving news today that** [**Etoro**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmtq9s/we_did_it/)**,** [**Tiger**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmt6lw/not_sure_if_posted_before_but_fyi_singaporean/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) **and** [**FUTU**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmvme5/hong_kong_apesss_using_futu_can_finally_vote/) **are now being made able to vote... So don't give up, if you had shares in time for the record date, then it is your right, do not take it lightly that they are trying to strip that from you.**\n\n**UPDATE:**  [The other half of Sweden is joining the battle! Nordnet have decided to follow Avanza's footsteps and register all GME customers in a broker non-vote!

But wow, I really have to hand it to this guy, he really feels like good people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDave has helped us countless times with our DD, sharing his unique perspective on events as they transpire. Not only is he incredibly intelligent, but he is a realist, who demands proof for every assertion, every theory, before jumping to conclusions. In this way Dave is an Ape that we should all aspire to be more like. Critically thinking about everything we read is imperitive to the success of the research thats done here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurther to that point, Dave is also not afraid to put himself out there to poke holes in people's theories. This is another invaluable asset to our community. It is crucial that this community does not slip into echo-chamber territory, and so far we have done a great job of that! Apes like u/Dlauer are part of that--\n\n So to him, and all the other apes who are out there, helping to refine theories and fact check DD...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you, and please keep it up. Your role here should not be overlooked!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome Notable posts from Dave:\n\n[GME Depth of Book](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbpvmh/gme_depth_of_book/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [Negative Volume Prints](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n772fg/negative_volume_prints/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Thoughts on price](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nky8jv/thoughts_on_price/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n# u/BodySurfDan\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for something a little more lighthearted, more of an arts and culture spotlight.
