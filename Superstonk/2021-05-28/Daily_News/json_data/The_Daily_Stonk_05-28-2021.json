(which I will go into a little detail below)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* there are genuine apes who hold AMC\n* Amc has been seen as a distraction\n* There is a theory that Adam Aron is a plant\n* People who are trying to divide apes\n\n# There are genuine apes who hold AMC\n\nRemember we have been seeing the same behavior happening with GME BB NOK AMC and other very heavily shorted stocks, as a lot of people joined in the long long ago of January we have seen apes buy more than just GME. So keep in mind there are people here who own AMC and they are genuine, and we should be happy for them\n\n# Amc has been seen as a distraction\n\nDue to the nature of Citadel filings ([found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmd04p/according_to_fintel_citadel_increased_their_long/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)) they have increased their long position on AMC to 163%, meaning they could be using the AMC squeeze the stave off a margin call, as we have theorised for months now they would pump another stock as a distraction (just like we have seen happen with certain crypto like CXC) in the hopes that the apes would FOMO into the other stock.\n\nLittle did they know that we already figured this strategy out since February, and it's ok, just imagine if the AMC apes took their AMC squeeze tendies and put them in GME, that's the point that SHF's forget, we can keep retarded longer than they can remain solvent.\n\n# There is a theory that Adam Aron is a plant\n\nNow there has been a theory floating around that AA may be a plant by SHF just like Jim Bell(end) was for GME, this in and of itself is not a weird theory as if you look into things like this is it's not out of the ordinary for things like this to happen.\n\nBecause if this is true (and lets for a second hypothesize that it is) if you were to make billions or go tits up, would you instal someone in the company you want to do this with to make sure this happens? because I would, now is there also a case to be made for AA just being... well AA and nothing more?Yes! both options are possible as of right now as we have not found exclusive evidence of either, meaning we can't rule out either.\n\n[link going into that a bit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmnfby/apes_under_attack_how_hedge_funds_and_banks_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n# People who are trying to divide apes\n\nThis one is the easiest, I've been posting since January that people should be Excellent to each other, and for the most part people have listened, for which we (the mods and fellow apes) are extremely thankful for because if we just were dicks to one and other this would've ended a long time ago.\n\nWe have now cultivated a culture of extreme helpfulness, kindness and generosity, this is our biggest strength because due to that we have formed a community which helps one and other in such an effective way that shills usually have zero ammo to fight with.\n\nNow if you look at this culture, this sub, and apes on other subs, the culture remains fairly much the same.\n\nNow AMC had a spike yesterday, and suddenly OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE, apes start \"fighting\" but when you look into them they're either fairly new accounts, or all they're doing is trolling across all kinds of subs, so what does that tell you? for me it's easy, that's a shill\n\nSo just don't engage, if a person is \"fighting\" with you verbally and you just don't respond there is no problem because it takes two to fight, just ignore the shills who want to fight, be nice and done\n\n&#x200B;\n\n([some reading regarding AMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmhm1s/amcs_spike_today_and_what_it_means_for_gme_hfs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) pump possible)\n\nJust remember MSM has never been on our side this entire time, we have not trusted them for the longest time because they inaccurately reported everything, don't start trusting their bs now, even if it feeds your confirmation Bias.
