<p>Good Morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole and this is your daily news.</p>
<p>Does anyone smell that?</p>

<p>Let's start with the basics once more!</p>
<p>https://reddit.com/link/nmsqhr/video/mcpqcoid7t171/player</p>
<p>Be sure to vote with your shares, don't think it won't matter because it does, over-voting would show there are lots of things being wrong and would give the company a much needed excuse to call their votes back in.</p>
<p>Also for the 6/9 (nice) annual shareholders meeting, remember that we will most likely not see a lot happen to the stock immediately after this because if they have something planned (NFT/Dividend/ recounting their own shares etc) it can be mentioned there but could still take some time before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Like the NFT is set to launch around the 14th, if they were to give a dividend it could also be a few weeks, a recount can take a lot longer though, due to the audit process being very specific it may take a month or maybe longer (I can't say, or imagine, how long auditing the shares would take as this is a scale because the situation unprecedented) and there is a chance the vote count can be doctored to make sure it shows a non accurate vote count, regardless of everything just hodl and wait, as news reports have already stated SHF have list close to 2 billion usd just from Monday till Wednesday, but also these are "paper" losses as there is only an actual loss once they close their positions.</p>

<h1>The 411 on AMC</h1>
<p>Now there has been some discussion going on here over the past few days, and the mod team and others have noticed something, a metric fuckton of shills.</p>
<p>To be clear on the AMC situation I need everyone to be clear on a few aspects. (which I will go into a little detail below)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>there are genuine apes who hold AMC</li>
<li>Amc has been seen as a distraction</li>
<li>There is a theory that Adam Aron is a plant</li>
<li>People who are trying to divide apes</li>
</ul>
<h1>There are genuine apes who hold AMC</h1>
<p>Remember we have been seeing the same behavior happening with GME BB NOK AMC and other very heavily shorted stocks, as a lot of people joined in the long long ago of January we have seen apes buy more than just GME. So keep in mind there are people here who own AMC and they are genuine, and we should be happy for them</p>
<h1>Amc has been seen as a distraction</h1>
<p>Due to the nature of Citadel filings (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmd04p/according_to_fintel_citadel_increased_their_long/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">found here</a>) they have increased their long position on AMC to 163%, meaning they could be using the AMC squeeze the stave off a margin call, as we have theorised for months now they would pump another stock as a distraction (just like we have seen happen with certain crypto like CXC) in the hopes that the apes would FOMO into the other stock.</p>
<p>Little did they know that we already figured this strategy out since February, and it's ok, just imagine if the AMC apes took their AMC squeeze tendies and put them in GME, that's the point that SHF's forget, we can keep retarded longer than they can remain solvent.</p>
<h1>There is a theory that Adam Aron is a plant</h1>
<p>Now there has been a theory floating around that AA may be a plant by SHF just like Jim Bell(end) was for GME, this in and of itself is not a weird theory as if you look into things like this is it's not out of the ordinary for things like this to happen.</p>
<p>Because if this is true (and lets for a second hypothesize that it is) if you were to make billions or go tits up, would you instal someone in the company you want to do this with to make sure this happens? because I would, now is there also a case to be made for AA just being... well AA and nothing more?Yes! both options are possible as of right now as we have not found exclusive evidence of either, meaning we can't rule out either.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmnfby/apes_under_attack_how_hedge_funds_and_banks_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">link going into that a bit here</a></p>
<h1>People who are trying to divide apes</h1>
<p>This one is the easiest, I've been posting since January that people should be Excellent to each other, and for the most part people have listened, for which we (the mods and fellow apes) are extremely thankful for because if we just were dicks to one and other this would've ended a long time ago.</p>
<p>We have now cultivated a culture of extreme helpfulness, kindness and generosity, this is our biggest strength because due to that we have formed a community which helps one and other in such an effective way that shills usually have zero ammo to fight with.</p>
<p>Now if you look at this culture, this sub, and apes on other subs, the culture remains fairly much the same.</p>
<p>Now AMC had a spike yesterday, and suddenly OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE, apes start "fighting" but when you look into them they're either fairly new accounts, or all they're doing is trolling across all kinds of subs, so what does that tell you? for me it's easy, that's a shill</p>
<p>So just don't engage, if a person is "fighting" with you verbally and you just don't respond there is no problem because it takes two to fight, just ignore the shills who want to fight, be nice and done</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Just remember MSM has never been on our side this entire time, we have not trusted them for the longest time because they inaccurately reported everything, don't start trusting their bs now, even if it feeds your confirmation Bias. (this includes Jimmy Cramer suddenly saying "YeAh Im On YoUr Side NoW" piss off Jimmy</p>

<h1>To summarize:</h1>
<p>The stars are aligning but expect fuckery, if you see someone fighting someone else because they hold another stock let them be and ignore them (old 4chan saying "don't feed the trolls"), be kind, check your own bias and be excellent to everyone!</p>
<p>Amc apes are still apes, all apes are friends, but remember this sub is GME focussed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>

<p>remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
