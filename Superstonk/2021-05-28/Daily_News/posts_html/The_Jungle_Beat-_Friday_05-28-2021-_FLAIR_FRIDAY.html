<h1>VOTE! by u/Bye_Triangle</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again, and again, until the voting is over-- we will be back here reminding everyone of its importance. All of this DD, all of this guidance from experts, all of this attention on this naked short-selling issue... will be for nothing, if we don't vote our shares. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We must vote our shares to show everyone how prolific this issue is. This isn't just a matter of corporate governance, this is about proving to everyone that our investment is being crushed by greedy naked short sellers dumping, potentially, millions and millions of "Phantom Shares" into the market. This isn't anything new, as all our AMA guests have said, this problem has been going on for decades in some form or fashion... But this time, the new variable is us. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>By participating in the vote you are ensuring that every last share that the shorts have fabricated and sold to us is counted. Once their actions see the light of day, in the form of the vote count, this will be the beginning of the end... </p>
<p>There is no way out for them as long as we all vote our shares. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong or doesn't fully grasp the situation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/z97v4vwduw171.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a41df2dc0005242453bbf31e58ecfe2eba73b4</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And to those of you who are told by your brokers that you aren't able to vote... make noise, tell them you demand your rights... If you own shares in a company, it is YOUR RIGHT to vote on that companies decisions. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>There is proof that this works, as we are receiving news today that</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmtq9s/we_did_it/"><strong>Etoro</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmt6lw/not_sure_if_posted_before_but_fyi_singaporean/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share"><strong>Tiger</strong></a> <strong>and</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmvme5/hong_kong_apesss_using_futu_can_finally_vote/"><strong>FUTU</strong></a> <strong>are now being made able to vote... So don't give up, if you had shares in time for the record date, then it is your right, do not take it lightly that they are trying to strip that from you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nn50ye/the_other_half_of_sweden_is_joining_the_battle/">The other half of Sweden is joining the battle! Nordnet have decided to follow Avanza's footsteps and register all GME customers in a broker non-vote! Including all customers in the other Nordic countries!</a></p>

<h1>Community Spotlight- Double feature:</h1>
<h1>u/Dlauer</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't think anyone expected Dave Lauer to become an Ape when he first started interacting with us... But wow, I really have to hand it to this guy, he really feels like good people. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dave has helped us countless times with our DD, sharing his unique perspective on events as they transpire. Not only is he incredibly intelligent, but he is a realist, who demands proof for every assertion, every theory, before jumping to conclusions. In this way Dave is an Ape that we should all aspire to be more like. Critically thinking about everything we read is imperitive to the success of the research thats done here. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Further to that point, Dave is also not afraid to put himself out there to poke holes in people's theories. This is another invaluable asset to our community. It is crucial that this community does not slip into echo-chamber territory, and so far we have done a great job of that! Apes like u/Dlauer are part of that--</p>
<p>So to him, and all the other apes who are out there, helping to refine theories and fact check DD...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thank you, and please keep it up. Your role here should not be overlooked!</p>

<p>Now for something a little more lighthearted, more of an arts and culture spotlight.  There have been tons of amazing musical apes coming out of the woodwork for months, feel free to share your favourites in the comments.</p>
<p>For today though, there is one Ape that I would like to give a shout-out to and that is u/BodySurfDan. I would be absolutely crushed if this didn't get the attention it deserves. </p>

<p>This is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Its capacity is approximately 250,000 fans. And we are near that many active members online at this very moment. Can you believe that?? There are roughly as many apes online rn discussing stonks as there are people in that picture. </p>

<p>|Harambe's Birthday</p>
<p>Friday - Harambe Memorial Day (R.I.P.)</p>
<p>There is electricity in the air this week as many apes have pointed out! It is important that this hype train keep on rolling, and that the steady drumbeat, keeps on beating. As long as you know that there is always more to be hyped about on the horizon, disappointment cannot catch-up. So with that in mind, allow yourself to feel the hype, but remember that if it doesn't happen this week...</p>
<p>We ain't going anywhere, it just means we get another week out in the jungle, screamin' with the apes. <strong><em>OOK OOK</em></strong> Just remember, we got this far cause we do our research and we trust our findings. Armed with data there should be nothing that can kill the vibe. In the words of Dr. Burry:</p>
<p><strong><em>"I may have been early, but I am not wrong"</em></strong> <em>(This quote has never rang more true)</em></p>
