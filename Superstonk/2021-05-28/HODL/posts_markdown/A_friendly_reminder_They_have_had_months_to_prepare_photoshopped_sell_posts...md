#Title: A friendly reminder: They have had months to prepare photoshopped sell posts, photoshopped graphs, fake figures and fake DD - all of which is ready-loaded like ammunition. Prepare to see a full scale barrage of these during MOASS from ALL social media platforms.

I always considered investing in GME to be like sailing a boat in a storm. Know that the boat is solid and strong. It is built on value, fundamentals, and hours of research.

However, it's equally important to know that the storm will be Truman Show levels of orchestration, and they will send you up and down on waves to try and get you tossed out of the boat. They'll thrash you with dips, they'll pelt you with FUD, and they will rain hard with false victory posts on selling in the low hundreds, the low thousands.

These shares are worth months of fighting, ***billions*** of dollars of tactics, market techniques, and overtime.

Buckle up. Hold throughout.

Peace and love, you glorious apes. See you all on the moon.

An edit: Thanks for the response. I, personally, am genuinely excited to exercise my complete desensitisation to the price and to ***absolutely*** fulfil the idea that this will be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. This *will* be a test but know **I plan on winning the Grand Slam.**
