<p>First of all... Congratulations on making through the months of crazy illegal and manipulative price phase of Pre-MOASS GME. You thought this was the tough part...? You are so wrong... Are you ready to talk about some uncomfortable truths about what we'll be facing during MOASS? Let's go...</p>
<p>Let me preface this by saying that only you are in control of when you need to to close your position. This is not financial advice. No one can tell you when the right price or time will be. Not even this post or any post on any subreddit or social media. Everyone has things going on in their lives that will require them to do what they need to do. With that said... Let's address what we will likely see.</p>
<p>Be wary of Media/Social media:</p>
<p>Shame and discouragement is already displayed everywhere. "FORGET GAMESTOP" and "INVEST IN THESE OTHER STOCKS!" are some things we're already seeing. You think it's at it's peak now? It'll be even crazier when the price is mooning. Retail will likely be blamed for the immoral actions that Wallstreet caused. They'll likely directly demonize you for "causing" this. Social media will be littered with screenshots of closed positions with massive gains to pressure everyone to close their positions as well. Many of the braggadocios posts will likely be from bots and shills to negate the damage done by irresponsible Wallstreet Hedge funds. This psychological attack of FOLO (fear of losing out) alone will be very difficult to push through. This feeling is experienced by very few and is difficult to manage even from the experts. Why? Because we are humans. Are you mentally ready to encounter and push through this? Know your price... And hold true to it. I personally believe the fair price for the GameStop MOASS is at LEAST $30 million and I will HODL through it.</p>
<p>Be wary of Family/Friends:</p>
<p>This one will be tough. For those who have kept your position secret from your family members and friends... Good for you. For those who have family who knows about your GME position, this might be extremely tough to deal with during the MOASS. Seeing the very people you love telling you to close your position and solidify your gains before your personal price range will be a very likely scenario. Be prepared to have the tough conversation with friends and family that only YOU will have power to close out of YOUR position and the price and timing of YOUR choosing. I have close family members who I am already mentally preparing myself to temporarily isolate from until post MOASS so I can focus on my exit strategy of my choosing. You all need to prepare for your own situation. Be ready to experience the true hardship of massive gains with family members because nothing is worse than "family guilt."</p>
<p>Be wary of yourself:</p>
<p>No one has encountered a MOASS situation before. At least not one on the very public scale like we're seeing now. Be mentally and physically fit so you can be in the best condition to face the MOASS. In many cases in life, you will be your own worst enemy. Focus on making the best possible plan and decision so you can achieve peace of mind for whatever outcome happens. Be ready to encounter situations that you have no idea how to handle. Most likely, you'll have time... Slow down and think about your choices before you make them. You will walk out of MOASS and your play on GME will pay out. You've been patient all the months, what's another few months (if it even takes that long).</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Be prepared mentally and physically for what's to come during the MOASS. Watch out for media/social media to shame and demonize retail for causing the squeeze. Watch out for posts bragging about how much money they've made because they've closed their positions. Be careful when dealing with friends and family pressuring you to close your position before your personal goals. Know your plan and be at peace with it. Take care of yourself so you can be in the best physical and mental state to deal with the MOASS. Take care of your affairs so the least amount of outside factors will affect your decision. </p>
<p>I personally plan to HODL every share past $30 million plus because we have ONE shot at this. Good luck everyone!</p>
