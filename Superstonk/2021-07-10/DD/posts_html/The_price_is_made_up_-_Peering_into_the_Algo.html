<p>Alright crayon munchers have I got a scoop for you.</p>
<p>Gather round, sit down and buckle up.</p>
<p>Look at this chart below</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/r0nbgkr49ga71.png?width=1135&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52f0d5c2afdec4012f1e37e7776be35dd2dd66c8</p>
<p>Recognise it? You should. That's Gamestop.</p>
<p>Let's now make an assumption. </p>
<p>First assumption: An Algorithm is doing almost everything. </p>
<p>That is all. Simple. Remember it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now lets look at Gamestop and just spot some features that an algorithm might use. Maybe some peaks, some troughs, just be creative with it for now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Then we start making better connections, and patterns start to emerge. We've already picked out repeating features 3 times, some even more. Whats going on here?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Next lets pick some crucial points, the start and the middle seem OK. Let's see if we can group some of these bad boys together and see.</p>
<p>Taking a bunch of points of interest and mashing their pictures together gives some nice comparisons. Notice how they all curve in the same general direction. With a big white space over in this corner, and another over here. This means i found some good consistencies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>This tells me the points i selected are all pretty consistent with an overall goal that an AI might use. Lets pick out all those sections individually. They all have a substantial increase at the beginning of the cycle and die down towards the end.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Counting all the cycles we can break the chart down into 4 sections.</p>
<p>The red lines are the duration of the cycle, the grey curves point to the start/end day and encompass the max price in that cycle.</p>
<p>Each cycle begins with a significant uptick on the daily.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/49kiam8kgga71.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddb811c147de9e15a6765402607f1c689f0f8261</p>
<p>We can put a simple curve around the start/end days and over the peak of the session.</p>
<p>The cycle is at the end of the 4th sequence.</p>
<p>So far 3 out of 4 start cycles have resulted in a significant moon of the stock.</p>
<p>We can then come up with 2 options. It moons again, or we wait another cycle. Lets graph them.</p>
<p>First up we have the moon case, brought to you by a Kitty</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/g07ecdhybga71.png?width=983&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea3091b1506b5d594ed21fc6567828971d88f0e6">I am not a cat</a></p>
<p>Or we get the less exciting nothingburger</p>

<p>Each cycle is 25 to 35 business days durations roughly.</p>
<p>I went and measured from the first uptick 12 jan. It's been 120 business days (124-4). </p>
<p>4 average cycles is 120 days. This could be a start over point in the algorithm, or it could go into reverse? A reset seems likely to my mind.</p>
<p>This puts Monday as day 1 of the new cycle. Or any day this week if there's delays for whatever reason.</p>
<p>We will know when the cycle has restarted because it will gain significantly. Although this gains may be lost in the coming days or go full MOASS. The MOASS could "start" 3 days after this uptick. (it may have already gained significantly by this time, but the algo phase takes 3 days).</p>
<p>Failure to break out in this cycle will mean waiting until the next restart of the cycle in approx 30 trading days. We won't know for about a week if this is the MOASS cycle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY tldr</strong></p>
<p>Constant cycles obvious. Start dates of cycle clear. Current cycle is ending. Coincides with halfway point of year, 4 cycles complete. The algo may reset to January conditions. Monday (or any day this week) could be first day of new cycle.</p>
<p>First day of next cycle will have a significant uptick &amp; may spiral into MOASS. MOASS may not occur immediately (3-7 days after first uptick), but the uptick means a new cycle has begun and the dice have been rolled. There won't be another cycle ending for around 30 business days.</p>
<p>Buckle Up.</p>
