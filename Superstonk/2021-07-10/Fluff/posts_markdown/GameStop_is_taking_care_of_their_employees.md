So I just left my local GameStop where I pre-ordered Zelda: Skyward Sword and Mario Party, and I was chatting with the cashier about the company.  He mentioned something I thought was very important.  He said that since Ryan Cohen has taken over, the employees have felt the effects.  In the form of PTO.  Employees now get PTO.  Let that sink in.  Ryan Cohen gave his workers PTO.  Legend.

Also as a side note, the store was running a promo, buy any shirt valued at 19.99 or more and get a $10 giftcard.  Boom, new Link t-shirt.  Love this company.

Edit:  I want to make sure that everyone understands what PTO is.  It is paid time off.  Apparently this is not as known to non-American apes.  Also, I cannot confirm PTO policies for GameStop, I am only reporting what the staff at my local GameStop told me.

Edit 2:  also wanted to clear up for Europoors and others who don‚Äôt live in the USA, PTO is common for full-time non-retail jobs.  My company for example has PTO, paid sick time, healthcare, 401k, etc.  It is mostly retail workers who get the shit end of the stick.  Anyone who works in retail can jump in and share their experience, as I have not been in retail for almost 20 years.
