<p>Remember Melvin Capital lost 49% on its investments in Q1?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you look at the MA50 for GME in that period we have:</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8203;</p>
<pre><code>MA(50, close) [2021-01-04] $14.41
MA(50, close) [2021-02-01] $44.28
MA(50, close) [2021-03-01] $63.82
MA(50, close) [2021-04-01] $141.61
</code></pre>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Now if we look at the MA50 data for the Q2 we have:</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8203;</p>
<pre><code>MA(50, close) [2021-04-01] $141.61
MA(50, close) [2021-05-03] $167.48
MA(50, close) [2021-06-01] $174.26
MA(50, close) [2021-06-30] $201.43
</code></pre>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we assume none of the short positions have been closed, what do you expect to happen in Q2?</p>
<p>I expect unacceptable losses for their clients, and if I were one of them, I would consider to pull out my money before it's too late.</p>
<p>Add to that the risk of margin calls, tightening regulation and the increasing popularity of GME stock among retailer investors; and you have a much worse situation for the HFs than six months ago.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Everything is worse for the HFs since January and it's getting worse by the day.</p>
