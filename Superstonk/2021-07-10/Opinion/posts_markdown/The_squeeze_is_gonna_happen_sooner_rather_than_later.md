Remember Melvin Capital lost 49% on its investments in Q1?

* If you look at the MA50 for GME in that period we have:

&#8203;

    MA(50, close) [2021-01-04] $14.41
    MA(50, close) [2021-02-01] $44.28
    MA(50, close) [2021-03-01] $63.82
    MA(50, close) [2021-04-01] $141.61

&#x200B;

* Now if we look at the MA50 data for the Q2 we have:

&#8203;

    MA(50, close) [2021-04-01] $141.61
    MA(50, close) [2021-05-03] $167.48
    MA(50, close) [2021-06-01] $174.26
    MA(50, close) [2021-06-30] $201.43

&#x200B;

If we assume none of the short positions have been closed, what do you expect to happen in Q2?

I expect unacceptable losses for their clients, and if I were one of them, I would consider to pull out my money before it's too late.

Add to that the risk of margin calls, tightening regulation and the increasing popularity of GME stock among retailer investors; and you have a much worse situation for the HFs than six months ago.

**TL;DR**: Everything is worse for the HFs since January and it's getting worse by the day.
