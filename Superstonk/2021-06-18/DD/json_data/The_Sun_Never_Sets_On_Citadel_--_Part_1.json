    "selftext": "[Hello Superstonk](https://i.redd.it/y39nj0kvo2671.gif)\n\n#Preface\n\nI became bothered by a question a few months ago.  The GME saga started with MAJOR fight in the financial landscape between Team Citadel vs. Team Other (Blackrock, Vanguard, etc.), and Superstonk is here now because of Team Other getting Ryan Cohen on the board at GME, then \u201cretail\u201d landed on the scene, now Apes, etc.  But this ONE question always bothered me:\n\n>**What did Citadel do to piss everyone off?  WHY would they want to give Citadel the most epic beat down in financial history?**\n\nSo I spent some time looking into that because it *must* be good and...\n\n***HO BOY, GET YOUR POPCORN, I\u2019VE GOT SOME GOODS TO SHARE WITH YOU AND IT\u2019S GONNA BE JUICY***  \n  \n***\n\nNote: this is a strategy post.  u/atobitt and u/criand focus on macro topics about Citadel\u2019s structure in the overall market, but this series is going to be about financial industry strategy.  I have a master\u2019s degree in business and specialize in strategy and operations.  While I don\u2019t have direct experience in finance per se, I really enjoy finding the \u201chows\u201d and \u201cwhys\u201d behind what businesses do.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ll give shout outs to the Apes who did relevant DD before this.  Parts of this are my own discovery, parts are building on the work of those who came before :)  This is an overall picture.\n\n\nSymbol indicators:\n\n* \\[] - request for link to relevant DD (r/Superstonk DD posts or legitimate sources)\n\n***\n\n#1.0: Introduction\n**The Price of $GME is artificial.**  Prior posts ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mn0q9q/theory_all_the_pieces_pt_1_the_anatomy_of_the/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms9z0n/theory_all_the_pieces_pt_2_the_deep_end_of_the/)) have covered how Citadel and other players in the market have greedily, illegally conspired to change the price of stocks for their own profit.  While Citadel\u2019s criminal price manipulation of GME represents a failed scheme to fabricate shares for profit, this was only a small corner of a much larger body of activity.    ***Citadel\u2019s overall activity shows a plan to monopolize markets worldwide and control securities transactions at the exchange level***.\n\nYep.\n\nBuckle up :)\n\n***\n\n# Key Term\n\n**Market Maker (or \u201cMM\u201d)** \u2013 a special role in a stock exchanges around the world.  An MM\u2019s primary role is to provide liquidity, or \u201cto make sure there are shares available to buy if people want them\u201d as well as \u201cmake sure there is a buyer if people want to sell.\u201d Exchanges need it: liquidity makes for easy buying and selling.\n\n* A MM is the intermediary for almost any securities transaction.  It is positioned between the exchange and the brokers/dealers/funds that do not have access to the exchange, or they use the MM to do the buying work for them, lol.  Or the MM is positioned on the other side of a transaction, supplying the securities in demand.\n* A MM is always in a position of risk.  They are constantly in a place to be on the losing side of a transaction if they \u201cguess\u201d wrong.\n* Note: Citadel has many branches, but it\u2019s two major branches are its hedge fund and its MM.  I will be referring only to its MM activity.  \n\n***\n\n#1.1: Plus Ultra\n\nTake a moment to marvel at how Citadel has installed themselves in [so many markets around the world](https://www.fi-desk.com/market-structure-meet-the-new-market-makers/). **They are Market Makers and/or liquidity providers in nearly every major exchange on earth:** (*Note: my undersrtanding of a liquidity provider is that it\u2019s a bit like a less-powerful MM*)\n\n[Citadel Securities own splash page](https://i.redd.it/tolp2scxfw571.png)\n\n* US/North America: NYSE, NASDAQ, CBOE (not even going to bother with links here, you know they\u2019re there), [Toronto](https://www.tsx.com/trading/toronto-stock-exchange/order-types-and-features/market-maker-program/market-makers-list?id=5)\n* Europe: [London/Ireland](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/citadels-technology-arm-posts-30-decline-in-2019-revenue/), Amsterdam[], Frankfurt[]\n* Asia/Pacific: Hong Kong, [Singapore](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-citadel-singapore/citadel-securities-hedge-fund-citadel-to-open-new-office-in-singapore-idUSKBN25K08J), Sydney [], Shanghai []\n* (Apologies on missing links, I\u2019ve saved so many links through this whole drama that I can\u2019t find some of my sources anymore.  And this is not the full list, this is only what I could put together for this post.)\n\nCitadel is truly an intmidating company based on the position it occupies in markets worldwide.\n\n\n#1.2: E Pluribus Unum\n\nSo WHY has Citadel strived to achieve such a large footprint across the globe?\n\n***Because there is a flaw in the markets across the world: it depends on Market Makers.***\n\n* Exchanges are set up to have several Market Makers providing liquidity.\n* So the Market Maker has responsibilities for supply and demand of a given security.\n* It\u2019s an essential service so exchanges empower MMs with exclusive powers and responsibilities.\n\nTake a look at the exclusive powers the NYSE gives its DMMs (like a \u201cSuper\u201d Market Maker):\n[From the NYSE DMM page](https://i.redd.it/n16pu83yiw571.png)\n\n* MMs have *Superpowers* and wield immense control over securities.  \n* Exchanges rely on incentives for winning bids (coupons) as a way of creating competition and fair prices at the exchange.\n\n**MMs are intended to be balanced by competing against each other**\n\n* ...so that the customers (brokers) can get the best value, and the Market Makers are financially rewarded for their service...\n* \u2026but that means the MMs are competing for as many transactions as possible on the exchange.  As much as their risk can allow.\n\n**So the better the MMs are at managing risk, the more control they have over the exchange (because they capture more of the transactions)**\n\n* And there are advantages for MMs who perform better and capture more volume \u2013 they can leverage the volume to achieve better prices and capture even *more* transactions.\n* You\u2019ve probably seen this chart, but it shows the size that MMs have become:\n[Citadel is almost as big as the CBOE \u2013 the main options exchange for the US](https://i.redd.it/idkn9cchpn571.png)\n * (Citadel, Virtu, and G1 are all MMs.)\n* The important part about that graphic is the NYSE, NASDAQ, and CBOE volumes *include the transactions with Citadel and Virtu*.\n\n**The MMs are becoming (or already are) bigger than the exchanges themselves.  And the exchanges depend on them.**\n\n* Furthermore, the exchange is limited \u2013 to a certain location, structure, set of regluations, list of securities, etc.  Almost all exchanges are for profit.\n* But if the exchange provides no security that can\u2019t be bought on another exchange, then the exchange needs to compete on best price - or else it's revenue goes away.\n* And exactly *who* at the exchange offers the best price?\n* But a Market Maker is free to engage in **multiple** exchanges.  So if a financial product is available in one exchange, but not another, and an MM is in both exchanges, then the Market Maker can offer it because it a separate entity (if it legally can).\n* And the Market Maker is free offer their best price at multiple exchanges, or even directly.\n\n**What advantage does the exchange itself have? They can\u2019t provide *anything* that the Market Makers themselves can\u2019t/don\u2019t provide.**\n\n * *As an analogy, if you are used to shopping for separate items across several stores \u2013 food at the farmers market, clothes at the mall, etc. \u2013 a company like Amazon or WalMart will have an advantage by selling the same items for a comparable price in one convenient place.*\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cmalls\u201d vs. \u201cTarget/WalMart/Amazon/Costco\u201d all over.  We all know who won that one.\n\n#1.3: Man o' War\n\nI mentioned \u201cvolume\u201d earlier \u2013 that is going to be key here.\n\n* Market Making is already very risky, but the size of the established players make it prohibitive for new entrants.  A new MM would need significant advantages to compete against Citadel, Susquehanna, and Virtu who will have superior positioning, expertise, technology, market understanding, funding, risk tolerance\u2026 \n\n> \u201cThe way to think about Citadel is as the Amazon of trading,\u201d says Spencer Mindlin, a capital markets technology analyst at Aite Group. In an industry that relies heavily on technology, Citadel has forged ahead by playing \u201ca game of scale. **You reach a point where it\u2019s impossible for others to compete,**\u201d he says. [emphasis mine] - [Quartz](https://qz.com/1969532/how-ken-griffins-citadel-transformed-financial-markets/)\n\nBackstory:\n\n* In the early 2010\u2019s Ken tired to make Citadel an investment bank and failed (lol)....\n* ...but it ended up being one of those \u201clemons to lemonade\u201d things for him.  Because Ken realized that other MMs were *banks*, which were a major disadvantage.  You see, *Banks* were encumbered with \u201cregulations\u201d, \u201ccapital requirements\u201d and stupid \u201cinvestors\u201d.  But Market Makers didn\u2019t need a bank, so they didn't need to have those pesky constraints.\n* Then Ken stopped trying to be a bank.  Which meant he could capture the MM market.\n* Citadel went on to buy out competing Market Maker assets from [Citi](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/05/16/citadel-securities-buys-citi-market-making-assets/84437638/), [Goldman Sachs/IMC](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/citadel-securities-reaches-preliminary-agreement-to-acquire-dmm-unit-from-imc-301149075.html), and  [KCG](https://www.tradersmagazine.com/departments/brokerage/citadel-purchases-kcg-dmm-business-becomes-1-on-nyse/) to grow his market share and reduce compeition.\n* And now, **the Market Maker field is NOT competitive.**  The number of DMMs in NYSE has **decreased** over the years.\n* Citadel has heavily \u201cleveled-up\u201d and is bar none THE biggest player on the field. \n\n**This is why Citadel is in so many exchanges.  Successful practices can be copied from one exchange to the next, with market advantages and rewards that scale.**  Why shouldn\u2019t Citadel be a MM in every major exchange on earth?\n\n* But you realize what this means, right?\n\n***The exchanges have become commodities.***  They are necessary for fulfilling their role as a securites selling venue, but have no unique value to themselves.\n\n>\u201d**We already have 16 stock exchanges, over 30 ATSs and handful of market maker SDPs**, do we really need the banks to further fragment liquidity?\u201d [emphasis mine] - [Themis Trading](https://blog.themistrading.com/2020/12/14434/)\n\nThe TRUE value to the market is a firm that spans multiple exchanges and offers the breadth of securities available at competitive prices. \n\n\n#1.4: The Commonwealth\n\n***But, but -- what about compeition?  What about Virtu, G1, and the MMs in other countries? I thought you said this was a cOmPEtITivE field.***\n\nIt\u2019s true, Virtu & G1 do \u201ccompete\u201d against Citadel.  But they have an... \u201cinteresting\u201d relationship which prompts some theories and requires further investigation.\n\n* First, Citadel needs to maintain the appearance of a free market to avoid antitrust lawsuits.  They also need other Market Makers to offload the transactions that they are unwilling to take.  A duopoloy or even triopoly is fine as long as they control the market.\n* Second, from Virtu\u2019s perspective (*they\u2019re the largest competitor so I\u2019ll use them here*), it doesn\u2019t make sense to go head-to-head directly with Citadel on transactions \u2013 Citadel has better positioning and a technological edge.\n* And directly competing with a superior opponent would be expensive for Virtu.  However, they would stand to **profit from joining with Citadel** if they took the same positions as them.\n* And wouldn\u2019t you know it, Apes have discovered that Virtu and Citadel are doing the *exact same things* across many tickers.  Here are 2 famous ones: [MAX-D](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nyxs1f/learn_from_the_past_when_they_didnt_care_to_hide/), [GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nr6urb/i_look_up_top_brokers_for_gme_year_to_date_and/)  [Any more Apes want to do asset comparison between Citadel & Virtu?  CALLING SUPERSTONKS MOST QUANTED] (s/o to u/BadassTrader, u/JustBeingPunny, u/Sti8man7)\n* That said, Virtu could still compete *indirectly* - they would need to find a niche where they could gain an advantage and separate themselves from Citadel\u2026\n* ...and oh look Virtu seems [very focused on client experience](https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_presentations/2020/09/Virtu-Financial-Presentation-Sept-2020-Draft-v3.pdf), where Citadel is focused on product and market position.  \n\n**So Virtu is disincentivized to directly compete against Citadel, and is incentivized to coordinate with and complement Citadel.**\n  \n\nMonopoly much?\n\n#1.5: The Crown Jewel\n\nIf you STILL believe that being a Market Maker IS competitive and that exchanges are NOT commoditized, and that Virtu and Citadel are taking the same positions for non-collusive reasons (\u201c*Exchanges are the pumping heart of a free economy!
