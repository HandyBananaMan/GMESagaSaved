Truly hilarious. \n\nThis sub could be deleted, gone, poof, and it wouldn't change a goddamn thing. I've been in the trenches with you absolute savages for months now, and as much as the daily confirmation bias helps, I know for a fact that if we all lost contact with every damn thing but the ticker and our brokerage accounts, this shit would STILL be an infinity squeeze.\n\nI used to get mad when I'd see these garbage attempts at division. But no more. I know we're all on the same page, and not a goddamn thing they can do will stave off what's coming. The greatest wealth redistribution in history. The changing of the financial guard. And even after this horrible crash, a better world, with newly-rich apes at the helm. \n\nRemain diligent. Keep up the good DD and hilarious memes. But if all goes to shit, don't forget the tenets that have been drilled into you in the past months. You don't need anyone but your damn self to make this monumental change happen. All us other apes will be holding alongside you. \n\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\u2764",
