NSCC-2021-002 SHOULD go live on June 21st, next Monday. This is the calls from Marge. The Supplemental Liquidity Deposit Adjustment, i.e. if we don't like your positions give us more money in 1 hour rule. If you can't pay, then fuck you, get liquidated. The teeth of NSCC-2021-801.

Expect the worst today apes. The price is wrong!

I think the market's not likely to have EVER seen volatility like what is coming before, as hedgies would need to dump assets (potentially enormous amounts) to free up cash intraday. There are stocks squeezing all over the market, cause hedgies shorted everything into the ground. So, I'm looking forward to Marge watching closely. Then maybe this mess can start getting cleaned up and GME holders end up rich in the process.

**EDIT:** You make a post and go to work, then come back to this holy crap folks. Now I know what RIP inbox means. I mostly made this post to encourage people to HODL on what I figured would likely be a red day. Turns out it was a baby red day, but who cares the price is wrong. 

This post seemed to be generally well received, but for those sending me notes about the age of my account being suspicious (I only used to lurk reddit and still mostly just lurk with the odd post here and there), saying I am hyping dates (just cause this rule goes into effect, doesn't guarantee it's MOASS time, it depends if the rule is actually enforced) and screaming about FUD/shilling (if what I posted here caused you fear/uncertainty/doubt, I don't really know what to say, other than you should get off Reddit for the weekend and go outside or something). I figure this is mostly trolls, since this community is generally pretty good. Gonna go cut my lawn and have a beer. 

**Fuck hedgies, I'll see y'all Monday.**

EDIT 2: Saw a comment from /u/Reeeeaper that the SEC could have up to 10 days to implement after Monday. We'll see if they want to kick that can even further with the end of the month falling into that window.
