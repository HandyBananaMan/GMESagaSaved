<p>IF 002 is approved Monday, it will have been approved by the SEC and the DTCC then it can be implemented IMMEDIATELY and not have the 10 day implementation period after being approved because that is what 006 does..it allows a rule to be implemented immediately!</p>
<p>Here is a link to a comment to clarify!</p>

<p>TLDR; The 006 rule basically takes the 10 day implementation time frame and can make it 0. ONLY when the rule has been APPROVED for implementing from SEC and DTCC. June 21 is the day that 002 is either going to be approved or denied.</p>
