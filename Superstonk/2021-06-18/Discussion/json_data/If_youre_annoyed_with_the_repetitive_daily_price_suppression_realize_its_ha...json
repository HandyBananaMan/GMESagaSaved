    "selftext": "Seen through a different lens this price suppression is excellent news and super bullish. They have no other levers to pull. The fud has no effect. There\u2019s almost no chance of profit taking from the majority of shareholders even if this thing runs up 100%, 200%, 300% from current sp. There are literally no other weapons left in the enemy\u2019s arsenal except for continued, predictable, you could set your watch to it price suppression through shorting.\n\nAnd not that anybody on this site needs any convincing but why on earth would they continue to do that day after day unless a significantly higher sp spells doom for them?",
    "title": "If you\u2019re annoyed with the repetitive daily price suppression, realize it\u2019s happening because it\u2019s their ONLY move. That\u2019s bullish af. They know once the price starts ripping it\u2019s over for them bc ain\u2019t nobody going to take profits higher up the chain.",
