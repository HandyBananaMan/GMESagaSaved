<p>You may have wondered if GME or AMC was the right choice at some point. Older apes know the answer, but let me give you a different point of view.</p>
<p>During the entire interview with u/dlauer, CNBC kept showing "reddit coments", but somehow ALL of them were about selling everything and diving in AMC(gamestop was hardly mentioned). </p>
<p>This cannot be random! If you take notice of comments in Superstonk, no even from the AMC sub, even they talk about GME, but somehow CNBC shows a bunch of comments all selling and throwing all in AMC.</p>
<p>Think Ape! Think! Why would they want you to see that?</p>
<p>I'm as smooth-brained as the next monkey, and I can't even write finanal advice, let alone give it, but this banana smells like Shit from Adelle.</p>
<p>Trust your jacked tits and hold!</p>
<p>EDIT: TO WHOMEVER GIVES ME AWARDS... Thanks and I hope you get a million tendies for each award you've given!</p>
