<p>Seen through a different lens this price suppression is excellent news and super bullish. They have no other levers to pull. The fud has no effect. There’s almost no chance of profit taking from the majority of shareholders even if this thing runs up 100%, 200%, 300% from current sp. There are literally no other weapons left in the enemy’s arsenal except for continued, predictable, you could set your watch to it price suppression through shorting.</p>
<p>And not that anybody on this site needs any convincing but why on earth would they continue to do that day after day unless a significantly higher sp spells doom for them?</p>
