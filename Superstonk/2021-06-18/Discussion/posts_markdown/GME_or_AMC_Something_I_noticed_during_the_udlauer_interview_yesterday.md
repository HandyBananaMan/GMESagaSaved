You may have wondered if GME or AMC was the right choice at some point. Older apes know the answer, but let me give you a different point of view.

During the entire interview with u/dlauer, CNBC kept showing "reddit coments", but somehow ALL of them were about selling everything and diving in AMC(gamestop was hardly mentioned). 

This cannot be random! If you take notice of comments in Superstonk, no even from the AMC sub, even they talk about GME, but somehow CNBC shows a bunch of comments all selling and throwing all in AMC.

Think Ape! Think! Why would they want you to see that?

I'm as smooth-brained as the next monkey, and I can't even write finanal advice, let alone give it, but this banana smells like Shit from Adelle.

Trust your jacked tits and hold!
