<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ed2FWNWwE3I">Quants | The Alchemists of Wall Street (2010)</a> - Paul Wilmott, Emanuel Derman, Mike Osinski: these are some of the most wrinkle brained badasses in finance I have ever listened to. These are the people who teach the quants - those people working at the SHFs trying to take your money, or the money from other hedgies. How are the financial systems modeled, and various deals incentivised? Listen to these insiders, the Godfathers of modern finance discuss how we got into this mess.</p>
<p>P.S. I would love to hear from Paul Wilmott now, but I think he keeps out of the limelight.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/kFQJNeQDDHA">The Wall Street Code (2013)</a> - A story about how Wall Street quant Haim Bodek discovered that his hedge fund/investment firm was being disenfranchised by the exchanges themselves. The exchanges had hidden mechanisms to prioritise certain order types, and as you can imagine, this was used to determine whose orders won, and whose lost.</p>
<p>Another serious wrinkle brain, Haim Bodek used his experience at previous investment firms to create a high frequency trading company in 2007. (Edit: A glimpse into the history of high frequency trading and automation on wall street and including interviews with u/dlauer)</p>
<p><img alt="Flash Crash 2010 (2011)" src="https://youtu.be/aq1Ln1UCoEU" /> - May 6th 2010, an incredible market crash happened. Hear from traders, analysts and journalists (an most importantly, Paul Wilmott again!) about experiencing the most unprecedented market crash - then recovery - in market history (up until that point).</p>
<p>This is just a great story, and give you a little peak into the madness that happens when the market runs away from the people who try to control it.</p>
<p>I'm sure some of you have seen this 3 part documentary series by VPro Backlight before, but I find them watchable again and again. There's nothing IMHO quite like putting human faces to all the decisions that go on behind the scenes. I first saw these about 5 or 6 years ago, and these are among my favourite documentaries ever made. I hope you enjoy them!  ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ç</p>
<p>Edit1: words are tough</p>
<p>Edit2: see 'Edit1'</p>
<p>Edit3: Oh shit! I only just realised our boy u/dlauer is interviewed as part of this documentary series!!! Much love to you. Are you still just as concerned about Shitadel lawyers today as you were then?!</p>
