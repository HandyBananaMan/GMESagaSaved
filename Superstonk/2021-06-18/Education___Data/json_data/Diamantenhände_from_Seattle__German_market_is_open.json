    "selftext": "Hello Great Apes of the world! \ud83d\udc4b Many thanks to u/thecactusblender for stepping in during my unexpected internet outage yesterday. Diamantenh\u00e4nde continues strong! It's been a week of sideways action on GME, though not in other (related?) news. Enormous jump in reverse repo activity, u/dlauer absolutely *KILLING* it on CNBC, and numerous failed attempts to break the floor only increase our resolve. Prepare your Diamantenh\u00e4nde as the German market leads us into a quad-witching day, and join together to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange as we prepare for the US pre-market to open!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80###\n\n\n\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 120 minutes in: **$224.31 / 186,88 \u20ac**\r\n- \u2b1c 115 minutes in: $225.39 / 187,77 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 110 minutes in: $225.39 / 187,77 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 105 minutes in: $225.39 / 187,77 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 100 minutes in: $225.39 / 187,77 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 95 minutes in: $225.24 / 187,65 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 90 minutes in: $225.27 / 187,68 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 85 minutes in: $225.24 / 187,65 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 80 minutes in: $225.24 / 187,65 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 75 minutes in: $225.24 / 187,65 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 70 minutes in: $225.24 / 187,65 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 65 minutes in: $224.31 / 186,88 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 60 minutes in: $225.09 / 187,52 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 55 minutes in: $225.12 / 187,55 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 50 minutes in: $224.94 / 187,40 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 45 minutes in: $224.91 / 187,38 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 40 minutes in: $225.15 / 187,57 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 35 minutes in: $225.09 / 187,52 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 30 minutes in: $224.85 / 187,32 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 25 minutes in: $224.85 / 187,32 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 20 minutes in: $224.85 / 187,32 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 15 minutes in: $224.91 / 187,38 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 10 minutes in: $225.06 / 187,50 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 5 minutes in: $225.06 / 187,50 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $224.94 / 187,40 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 US close price: $223.59 / 186,28 \u20ac   *($222.50 / 185,37 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n\nFAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie and converting to USD. Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.20030008. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.\n\nI'm not trying to permanently take over this tradition, just keep it going for fun on days when u/DerGurkenraspler doesn't start the thread at the normal time. They have been unexpectedly absent recently, but I will gladly bow out of this role when they resume updates.\n\nMany have expressed concern for the founder of Diamantenh\u00e4nde. I continue to attempt to contact him, but have not received a reply. However, I have heard from someone who knows our German friend. They have indicated that he is okay, but has some external factors that he needs to focus on.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
