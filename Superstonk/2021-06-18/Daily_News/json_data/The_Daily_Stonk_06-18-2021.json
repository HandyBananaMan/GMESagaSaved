My rationale is that the daily low have been following a long predictable pattern in a similar manner as T+X and Elliot waves. This tells me that the daily low can somehow be used as a metric to gauge future price movements.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05o39qh4pz571.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd410e5da7c66c02620decde41fa8ec498d1e469\n\n**A** **round of applause for the NEW Vice President of Private Label and Global Sourcing!

we've received confirmation from the exchanges that it's done, just like the ATM share offering, we think it's done, yet we are waiting for official confirmation on that before we can do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ma8czrotqz571.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e4a83de94c3f019b82c3fcf8687fbd11bcc2d8d\n\nAlso as a side note, the EDGAR system is out today, this means the markets are still open but the EDGAR filing system (used for the forms) wont be receiving updates today and will be updated again on monday, the Edgar system is were we would normally find the 13k forms and stuff like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pectsz85qz571.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa7076944ddf604cb3fc301b731c92dcc45aea4f\n\n[NYSE president admitted Dark

Ryan Cohen has bought shares\n\nThis is pure speculation at this point, we didn't receive a 13f filing stating he did, we didn't receive any formal notice from GameStop.\n\nSo everything regarding this is currently speculation as it could be easily explained away as a glitch.\n\nThere is an entire thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o22pn0/stop_the_misinfo_ryan_cohen_has_not_bought_shares/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n# The banks are down?\n\nSeems the banks have been having some pretty red days in the past days, but lets take an outside view on this for once, there is a thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o2ajxm/if_the_fed_just_announced_theyll_raise_interest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in r/stocks which could give us some more \"conservative\" information on this subject, because we are looking at this problem from one direction, lets get another POV and lets see if it could help perhaps bring a new wrinkle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05hgtf74sz571.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb573dc880a06f315bb69780f569b263f1ebea88\n\n# Bloomberg terminal

are also a couple of other things I want to add but I need to take care of some IRL stuff and will be adding them in a bit later, sorry for the inconvenience

here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\nRemember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/doww5nvzsz571.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b883cce7d9c03a1b9824cb7cc7c4411b5f798085\n\nremember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it
