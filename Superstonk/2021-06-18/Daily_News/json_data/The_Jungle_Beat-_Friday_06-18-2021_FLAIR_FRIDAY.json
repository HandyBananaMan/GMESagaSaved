[r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) does not receive any money when they are purchased, but it does receive Coins when users gift Community Awards.\n\n>Community Awards are unique to each community, and members can give them to each other. Moderators can design and name the Awards however they want.A portion of Coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited to the community\u2019s Coin balance. Moderators can use Coins from that balance to reward members with Mod Awards. The Coin balance is shown only to moderators in the community\u2019s sidebar.\n\nModerators do NOT have access to the [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) coin bank other than to give Community Awards on this sub to quality posts and comments. Moderators do NOT receive any coins personally, and only certain mods with permissions can access the coin bank for this purpose.\n\n**Community Award:** Any user can gift this award for an amount of Coins (min. 500) to a post or comment. Each of these awards will also gift Coins to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) itself, allowing mods to give mod-exclusive awards. For example, a 500 Coin Community Award also gives the subreddit 100 Coins.\n\n**Mod-Exclusive Community Award:** These awards are purchased using the Coins available only to mods from the [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) Coin bank, and give a certain amount of Reddit Premium to the recipient. For example, a 1800 Coin Mod-Exclusive Community Award will grant one month of Reddit Premium.\n\n*Reddit Premium gives 700 monthly coins, access to Premium Awards, and more. Learn about it here:* [*https://www.reddit.com/premium*](https://www.reddit.com/premium)\n\nCurrently, we have two Community Awards: the **Superstonk Award** (500 Coins, giftable by members), and the **Not-A-Cat Golden Bananya Award** (1800 Coins, giftable by mods only).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Ape Not Fight Ape, unless for top prize! ](https://preview.redd.it/qu1bovcbt2671.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=90e30b0607a2d5dc049ec2783446ef5ca5f92743)\n\n# Award Contest\n\nWe ask you, [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) members and lurkers, to use your best design skills to create award icons that we can then place into the Community Awards. You will need to think of a great name, too, but note we must keep it (mostly) family friendly. We are limiting to one design/name per submission, so make it good!\n\n**The top eight designs will be made into the following awards:**\n\n* **5th-8th:** Community Award (cost: 500 Coins, 100 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))\n* **4th:** Community Award (cost: 1000 Coins, 200 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))\n* **3rd:** Community Award (cost: 2000 Coins, 400 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))\n* **2nd:** Mod-Exclusive Award for 1-month Premium (mod cost: 1800 Coins)\n* **1st:** Mod-Exclusive Award for 3-month Premium (mod cost: 5400 Coins)\n\nAdditionally, **1st and 2nd place will receive FOUR of the new 3-month Premium mod-exclusive awards** on their top posts and/or comments, **3rd and 4th place will receive ONE of the new 3-month Premium mod-exclusive award**, and **5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th place will each receive ONE of the new 1-month Premium mod-exclusive award**. This will effectively win you Coins and Premium membership, as well as serious clout from designing an official sub award.\n\nTo submit, please follow the guidelines below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Welcome to the Jungle](https://preview.redd.it/cuqvmaset2671.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd18819a16ccebcd1e0b23d3e98bf60a96bf8f9)\n\nSubmissions must adhere to the following:\n\n* Image file attached to email with these attributes:\n   * **Design Image**: PNG with alpha layer (or) animated GIF with alpha layer\n      * If a gif, we cannot guarantee it will work in our bracket system (will try)\n   * Must be square crop (1:1 ratio)\n   * Width and height should be equal, and at least 512px\n   * File size limited to 2MB\n* **Name of Award** (Appropriate Titles Only; otherwise we will change it)\n* **Username of Artist** (must have history on [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) without Ban)\n* One submission per user\n* Rules must be followed; NSFW or improper designs/titles will be disqualified\n* **Designs must be original content**, or created by submitter; no copying from Google Images or stealing others' work\n* (optional) **Include a hyperlink to the image** as backup (i.e. Imgur)\n\n# PLEASE FOLLOW THESE \ud83d\udc46 REQUIREMENTS OR YOUR SUBMISSION WILL BE REJECTED.\ud83d\udc8e Send submissions to [superstonk\\_mods@protonmail.com](mailto:superstonk_mods@protonmail.com)\n\n*We will not accept awards tagged in posts, sent by Message or Chat, or over Discord.

(years? What decade is it?) This has been a crazy journey and I want to take a minute to check in with the group. Everybody has been go-go-going.\n\nThe media is everywhere (**MSM** for those wondering wtf that acronym means- **M**ain **S**tream **M**edia) and it seems that they are trying to paint a picture of collusion on the $GME stock and others (which they deem \"meme\" stocks which at this point is borderline weaponized against us but I digress) and I know there is a general air of concern around the entire community. I'm just reassuring you guys. This gal right here and the whole mod team, are making sure to keep the sub a very tightly run ship. No fuck-ups allowed. The hedgies and their bought MSM platforms are trying, desperately, to gain access to the fortress of our City of Athens, and the walls remain steadfast. This will not change for the foreseeable future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want everyone to seriously take a mental health break from all this whenever you can. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[me @ me rn](https://preview.redd.it/556n4iyf23671.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dae16d0caf1068f5f8447c1c2b35e4d0cc37b196)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrink plenty of water.
