This is my thesis on what I think GameStop is, or should be building. 

I have a tech background and an interest in blockchain technologies and crypto. A geeky woman with a dream of a digital paradigm shift. 

Let’s talk about NFTs or “non-fungible tokens”. NFTs are simply a way of representing a unique digital token in the blockchain. Think of it like digital copyright, or a stock certificate that proves you own a unique digital item. It is in essence a form of smart contract that allows the production of a digital item to be recorded in the blockchain and optionally transferred to another owner. 

The last years in gaming have seen walled gardens such as the App Store allowing game developers to finance game development through the use of loot boxes and other in-game purchases. These digital goods are a single sale between the game developer and the gamer. They are priced based on rarity and most game developers are aware that rate “whales” are willing to drop tens of thousands of dollars on extremely unique digital items. But this isn’t a real marketplace. It’s one dimensional. 

So where do NFTs and the blockchain fit into this puzzle?

Imagine building a platform where any game developer can produce digital content (whether that be the game itself or in-game content - for actual secondhand games, imagine Amazon used sales but with instant transfer) and uniquely represent it as an NFT. Game developers can also allow game mods to produce digital content for their own games and have them represented as NFTs. Those assets can also attract fees as royalties back to the game developer and GameStop based off the smart contact. In producing these digital goods you’ve now given people that opportunity to invest in those goods speculatively. These are now investments. They can hold them and offer them for sale on your exchange or any other exchange that is connected to that blockchain. They can be auctioned. The possibilities are endless. Imagine a world where you have a platform for all digital goods, which starts off in the gaming vertical, but can be applied to any digital goods. 

Perfectly aligned with NFTs and blockchain technology is the concept of cryptocurrency. By starting your own proof of stake coin and tying it to that market you now have a medium of exchange for those goods. All digital. All non fiat. A cryptocurrency that would be actively used daily by millions of tech savvy gamers to enjoy a new style of games and virtual worlds. 

As the creator, you also own the coin. People could be offered early access to buy GameStonk (it’s what I’m calling the new coin). You could even offer preferential discounts to $GME shareholders. But that would require a share count and proof of share ownership... cough cough naked shorts. 

You could also theoretically, using the new digital NFT marketplace that you’ve built, offer digital shares as an IPO of your company. Your shares are now traded in your own currency and on your own blockchain platform. 

Welcome to a brand new world where Wall Street is no longer needed, every stock certificate is unique and verifiable. 

I think this is the direction they are headed and if they aren’t, I think they should, because it’s the kind of digital world that I want to live in.
