**Foreword**:

This post is an expansion of my theory on what the financial media is doing, as recommended by another user [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o2bi28/to_me_this_was_the_best_part_of_the_whole_melissa/h26vzct/).

&#x200B;

[TL;DR for what comes below](https://preview.redd.it/6djz40h191671.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=b33e6c27459e3be8b91fad98c3ca344471985dae)

&#x200B;

**Overview**:

Citadel created a gigantic, steaming pile of dung in the middle of the lobby. Now everyone is dealing with it. The question is, how to most of the various parties get what we/they want with minimum collateral?

&#x200B;

**The Problem:**

The market was going to crash. COVID and QE gave a nice, bundled calamity reasonable enough to blame for the crash. What everyone didn't count on was Citadel et al committing massive fraud; then getting caught with their pants around their ankle and exposing everyone to the blowback from it. Now we have hundreds of millions-to-billions of counterfeit shares that need to be rectified; pissed off retail investors watching the financial sector and combing through everything; and foreign entities concerned with the stability of the US markets and USD.

&#x200B;

**Key Players:**

You need to understand who is involved and what their goals are in order to understand the decisions they will make and where the road will travel.

1. **Citadel and other Short Hedge Funds (SHFs)** \- The guys that caused all this. They want to survive, but that's unlikely.
2. **Retail Investors** \- financially wronged by SHFs. Want Citadel to crumble; nice payout; see GME succeed. *Edit: Some also want complete financial reform; or destruction of all financial institutions; or all financial criminals to go to jail; but that's counter to the desires and goals of the other parties and is a post-MOASS continued discourse.*
3. **Financial Media** \- was funded by Citadel et al. Wants to survive; keep control of market.
4. **Financial Cartel** \- vexed by SHF actions with GME and T-Bills. Want to survive oncoming liquidity crisis; keep relevance in market.
5. **US Government** \- trying to maintain financial stability. Need to balance domestic programs with foreign influence. Trying to counter Chinese Belt and Road.
6. **Foreign Entities** \- concerned with US financial stability/corruption. Risk of moving from US investments to Chinese investments.
7. **Bystander Investors** \- generally unaware of events. Need confidence in financial stability.

&#x200B;

**Common Themes:**

1. Survival
2. Market Stability
3. Foreign financial investments

&#x200B;

**Potential Outcomes:**

There are a couple potential outcomes.

&#x200B;

The DTCC or US Government could step in and halt or otherwise price-fix trading on GME. This would obliterate foreign confidence in the system and undermine the US' financial leverage on influencing foreign policy. In other words: *Bad for the US Government and bad for the financial cartel.*

&#x200B;

The financial cartel could let Citadel's implosion and the GME fallout run unabated. This is almost certain to expose the corruption of all of the financial cartel, *which would have the same effect as the previous measure.*

&#x200B;

However, I believe that the financial cartel and US Government have already embarked on an effort to control the narrative to minimize the fallout of the Citadel implosion without undermining the confidence of the financial market and US foreign influence (whether intentional or otherwise). It works like this:

&#x200B;

1. Hint at market fuckery.  ✅
2. Control the narrative.  ✅
3. Pepper "Citadel" and "retail"/"reddit" into the narrative.  ✅
4. Lead narrative to "lone wolf" aggressor theory (Citadel).
5. Avoid mentioning GME; redirect to less explosive stocks.  ✅
6. Keep focus on Citadel during implosion; not on financial cartel.
7. Once implosion starts, then associate GME.
8. Associate market crash with Citadel "lone wolf" cancerous behavior.
9. After Citadel is insolvent, carve up and feast by financial cartel.
10. Close out the shorts to make the muckrakers go away.
11. Tout about how retail investors defeated the "lone wolf".
12. Show all of the previously passed self-imposed policies.
13. US Government takes cut (25%-39.6%) of Sched D profit to infrastructure programs.
14. US/financial cartel avoids loss of faith in economy by world.
15. Retail investors spending accelerates economic rebound.

&#x200B;

**1. Hint at Market Fuckery:**  ✅

We see this now. CNBC, NYSE, SEC identifying PFOF and dark pools as problem areas. This braces the various parties to expect it to grow to be a larger story. You don't just go "here's a ton of evidence of market fraud!" you need to drip-feed it to people to prevent rejection of the system.

**2. Control the Narrative:**  ✅

The financial media absolutely wants the story to release as little as possible to keep viewers hooked. The financial cartel and US government want the blows to be soft enough to not shake confidence too much; as well as to mask all areas impacted by the necrosis.

**3. Pepper Associative Words into Narrative:**  ✅

Start adding Citadel and Retail Investors/Reddit into the mix. We're seeing this as well. You want people to get familiar with the names and associate them with the upcoming events. Building that groundwork to make easier connections with less digging and potential to expose the truth.

**4. Lead narrative to "lone wolf" portrayal:**

This is where I think they are going. Citadel absolutely will be the sacrificial lamb. It's the easiest play to satisfy most retail investors, regulators, and the public at large. Plus it serves to mask the necrosis and instill confidence in the US financial sector and US stock market.

**5. Avoid mentioning GME:**  ✅

You will see this through the previous points; and indeed we are. GME is the problem that Citadel created; it will be its own liquidity hole. No need for more financial bystanders to decide that they want to also make a quick buck off of the situation. Mention other stocks instead; preferably ones that will still provide some payout but will not break the bank. The insurance policy is going to be unpleasant as it is.

**6. During implosion, keep focus on Citadel:**

This is the narrative: Citadel is imploding. Any market waves is "because of Citadel". This is the easy part; everyone's going to be watching with popcorn and bananas.

**7. Once the implosion starts, then GME is okay to discuss:**

The problem is the shorts. Once Citadel implodes, the shorting stops and the stock impossible to buy. At that point, it's okay to talk about GME because the FOMO crowd is too late. This will be the groundwork for number 11.

**8. Associate market crash with Citadel:**

The market is going to crash. There's no doubt about it. It will likely cause Citadel to finally take its last breath and then trigger the GME MOASS. But people don't really pay attention; it will be easy to blame the crash on Citadel and their "lone wolf" behavior.

**9. Carve up Citadel:**

This is the part that the financial cartel is salivating over. Also raises the capital to resolve the counterfeit shares. The other financial behemoths will carve up pieces of Citadel's empire for themselves and auction it off. One of the new rules (can't remember if DTCC or NSCC) allows inviting of certain parties, which means Blackrock also has a seat at the table to feast.

**10. Close out the shorts:**

A convenient fall-guy (Citadel) has fallen. Now the financial cartel will pay off the folks that keep muckracking out of spite - in other words, they buy back the shares. Anything else, to include trying to price-fix will result in loss of confidence in the US market by the entire world. But hey, that money will come back to them in bailouts, so they are just miffed more than anything. They will probably sandbag this a little to try and get retail to deflate their sell prices a bit to try and deflate the infinity squeeze. This point is an assumption that, even with people holding out of spite, that enough will sell to balance out the books.

**11. Tout about David and Goliath:**

Expect a million stories on how GME redditors defeated the lone wolf Citadel and saved the US economy. Hooray! Yeah, we know this is mostly bullshit; but when the alternative is China ruling everything then everyone else is likely to go along with it.

**12. "Don't regulate me, bro":**

Remember all those rules the DTCC et al were churning out to prevent another GME-type retail win? Yeah, they're going to tote those rules at this point to avoid regulation and add credence to the lone wolf story. They'll probably be successful too.

**13. Uncle Sam's Cut:**

Apes will pay their cut. For all the US apes, it's likely to be somewhere between 25% and 39.6% to the US government (not even considering state taxes). This means that a lot of the financial sector's funds are now freed up to be used for the POTUS' infrastructure programs.

**14. Financial Cartel Rebounds:**

Redditors are going to be salty about this, but the truth is that the US will not let these "too big to fail" financial companies fail. In fact, they're going to consolidate power and continue on to the next market crash down the road. Everyone will forget their role in all this, save the half-a-million redditors. Better than the US economy collapsing for most Americans and China ruling the world.

**15. Retail investors spending accelerates economic rebound:**

Overall, ape spending will help stimulate the economy and rebound us out of the oncoming recession. However, it will also temporarily disrupt some luxury markets (especially Lamborghini).

&#x200B;

***Edit: What about the apes aiming for financial reform/actual accountability:***

*Unfortunately, I think that this will be a longer struggle for the folks seeking reform. I imagine that there will be some that won't sell out of principle; those that found financial reform orgs; and apes that continue to strive for better markets. At the end of the day the US government is going to do what it takes to maintain the appearance of financial stability. In this regard, expect a lot of pushback post-MOASS and a rebalance of the Superstonk makeup (those in it for the money/liberation of Gamestop will see somewhat of an exodus; the "financial reform" group will likely flock to this cause).*

&#x200B;

*Personally, I like the stock and I like Gamestop. Once this rocket takes off, I'm going to be the King Retard of Mars and enjoy my retirement while supporting my local Gamestop.*

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

While the key parties have plenty of room to be absolute dumb asses and hang themselves with the situation at hand, I believe that they will pursue the path I've outlined as it's the least destructive to the financial market and US influence on world economics. With a little finesse, the financial cartel and US Government could turn the situation into an economic win in some capacity.
