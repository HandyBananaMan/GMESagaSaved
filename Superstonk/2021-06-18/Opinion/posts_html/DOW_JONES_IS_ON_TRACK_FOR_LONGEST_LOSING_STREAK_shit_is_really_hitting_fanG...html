<p>Everything is interrelated in this financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>1) surging US dollar (eur ⬇️ yen ⬇️ gbp ⬇️ cad ⬇️ sek ⬇️ chf ⬇️ )</p>
<p>2) gold ⬇️</p>
<p>3) cryptocurrencies ⬇️</p>
<p>4) Lumber ⬇️ (loses a whopping 45% from $1711)</p>
<p>5) US 10 year yield ⬇️</p>
<p>6) flatter yield curve (imagine heart ❤ beat is flat)</p>
<p>7) $2.2 trillion gamma expiration today (as reported by zerohedge)</p>
<p>All of these things are happening, imo is related to the surging RRP which many ape has been posting, it has risen to record $755 bln (not sure what's today yet, waiting for RRP's APE to post). THE PAIN IS REALLY KICKING HARD. I don't know when is GME's MOASS, but I sure know, it ain't going much lower. Eveyone knows GME IS NEGATIVE BETA. Stocks down gme up. The reason being probably related margin debt hit record high, so generally speaking if stock down Margie call 📞 is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Whatever the case BUCKLE THE FARKING UP 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
