    "selftext": "So a little while ago this article came out:\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-amc-russell-1000-51623883459\n\nFor those who missed it the TLDR of it is that GME will be significantly less heavily weighted in the Russell 1000 ETFs then it was in the Russell 2000 ETFs. They then presented this as FUD by saying this will lead to net sell pressure on the ETF rebalancing day as more shares will be sold by the Russell 2000 ETFs then will be bought by the Russell 1000 ETFs. \n\nApes then got so caught up discussing whether or not this would lead to net sell pressure on ETF rebalancing day, that they missed an important take away. I personally am unconcerned about whether or not we will see net sell pressure on ETF rebalancing day. Given the short sales by SHFs and ATM offerings by gamestop since January, it seems clear to me that all apes know is buy & hodl and everyone here is addicted to snorting crayons and riding the volatility rollercoaster. Institutional sell pressure for one day wont matter in the long run when apes buy the dip and diamond hand it. So what is the takeaway that we should have from this article and why are my tits so jacked they are chafing?\n\nGME will be significantly less heavily weighted in the Russell 1000 ETFs then it was in the Russell 2000 ETFs. That means that SHFs shorting the Russell 1000 ETFs will be SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EFFECTIVE AT SUPPRESSING GME STOCK PRICE MOVING FORWARD. The fact that this will be expensive as they would have to open all new short positions on the new ETFs, and that it will be less effective at suppressing the stock price, it effectively takes this strategy off the table for the SHFs to suppress the stock price.\n\nJust look at the article to see how less effective this will be, GME is going from being weighted 0.5% to less than 0.005% in these new ETFs. That means that moving forward shorting ETFs will be 100 times less effective at suppressing GME. Looks like hedgies will have to reevaluate their playbook.\n\nTLDR; because GME will be less heavily weighted in the Russell 1000 ETFs it will only be a fraction of a fraction as effective to short the ETFs to suppress GME SP.",
