Obligatory smooth brain disclaimer. 

I have watched from the sidelines all year. Now though, I’m seeing mentions of the RRP in multiple financial subreddits. The president of the NYSE has basically admitted that there is market manipulation happening. And at the end of this month the mortgage relief ends. 

I was up all night and now today reading and reading. Holy fuck. MOASS isn’t just a play around one stock anymore. It’s now EVERYTHING. 

Just became a shareholder. This is bigger than Shitadel. This is the entire economic system. I bought my shares and this is my hedge. Thanks for having me.

Edit: RIP inbox. 

A lot of people are asking what made me hop on the rocket ship. It was really a smattering and I can’t find them all but here were my big catalysts. 

1. This one I spent so long in. Googling terms. Rereading to understand. I sent this one to my dad today and told him to have at least 30 minutes to dig through.
