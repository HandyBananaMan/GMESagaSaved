The president of the NYSE has basically admitted that there is market manipulation happening. And at the end of this month the mortgage relief ends. \n\nI was up all night and now today reading and reading. Holy fuck. MOASS isn\u2019t just a play around one stock anymore. It\u2019s now EVERYTHING. \n\nJust became a shareholder. This is bigger than Shitadel. This is the entire economic system. I bought my shares and this is my hedge.
