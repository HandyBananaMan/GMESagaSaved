The reset will be effective as of July 1, 2021.\n\n[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/6/2/MBS988-21.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/6/2/MBS988-21.pdf)\n\n As u/criand was kind enough to respond on a thread about this: \n\n>Might not mean anything, these resets are standard every \\~6 months. HOWEVER...  \n>  \n>The CCLF increased the liquidity requirement of members earlier this year. The funds help the FICC in the event of a member default. I believe the below post is much more interesting than this reset.  \n>

Volume difference\n\nSo I've seen some troll posts talking about how hodling doesn't work, I also found a thread by u/GoochTainter [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqtcd8/hooolllly_fuck_look_at_the_volume_on_january/)\n\nIn January we had movement (volume) that reached into the millions but the past weeks volume has been fairly low in comparisson, How low you ask?  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/okqp0nr5h0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=448549f1c56301309eecc93d5c05dbf8a2396f69\n\nLook at that, the price is almost at the squeeze levels of January with close to no volume, this is insane! this proves to me (personally) that we are correct about most of the DD we've seen, we've proven that the FTD cycles of both T+21 for regular shorts and T+35 for options are real, we've seen them push other stocks (silver, amc, BB, nok) on MSM while completely ignoring GME and only making posts \"15 stocks to make you forget GME\" and we've found that our tits are indeed, Jaqued.\n\nIf you own one of those other stocks, awesome I'm genuinely happy for you guys, but remember this is a GME sub, so lets keep those stocks to a minimum, again if you have a correlation between them it's ok to post it here, or a theory how they all connect etc, but not oh look at my XXX stock, the first one is helping, the latter is seen as a distraction.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h95s8ir5i0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0307e0ae5d9ea12459865edba59dfafc3611e30\n\n#  Gamestop confirms release of Q1 results and meeting date\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9r27ej8i0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb6d963fd40936a4563f7c8e2281b20a818f8ab2\n\nNow this is a fun one so let's go over this because there is a lot of information in this even if it looks fairly plain from first glance.\n\nFirst all the date, 6/9 is the date they also released their Q1 numbers in 2020, so they are keeping the same schedule ( I've seen post saying this is earlier than normal but it seems to be the exact date like last time).\n\nLast years Q1:[https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results)\n\nAfter this call all the information released by GME HQ will be available on their website\n\nThey will host an Investor conference call at 5 PM ET the same day to review the companies financials.\n\nThe phone number for investor conference call is **877-451-6152** Code to enter is **13720011** \n\nThe annual shareholders meeting will be held at 6/9 11 AM ET and will only last 15 minutes\n\nGeorge Sherman will be attending the physical meeting and the other directors will be there via zoom/skype etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow what does this all tell us?\n\nThey have a seperate call for the Q1 earnings report (look back at the Q4 call that lasted 20 minutes with sherman phoning it in), this will focus on the direct financial side of things, meaning their actual earnings (duh).\n\nThe Annual shareholders meeting however is a different beast entirely, with this one we can hear a lot of things coming, we can hear the roadmap the company is going to use in the coming years, we can hear how the board will be placed, who will become the new CEO but also one thing that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention \n\nThe Share count, at most we will hear a preliminary counting, because if our theory about the huge amount of phantom shares is true (yes until confirmed by the company its still a theory and yes these numbers can be fucked with before it even gets to the company), the cut off date for counting is the 6th of June, meaning if they get millions more it will take some time to get through this.\n\nHOWEVER, this is also a good thing, if they can see from preliminary numbers that the sharecount is out of wack, they can get an Auditor, just to make sure the shares are correct.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso keep in mind we may not hear everything we want to hear at the shareholders meeting because after this meeting GME will be more \"free\" to discuss which direction they want to go into and the \"silent\" period for the company may be over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jp2wyi3xk0371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e18421628127d5cd273b0b965dcbcd76703961b\n\nRemember my Favorite book series?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnrd8lo3l0371.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b54ec77d30baa123ef78e87da1226e7810366f4\n\nExpect it, just saying, I'm constantly waiting to get a rug pull as a last sort of hail mary, but the awesome part is that I can see in the posts that I'm far from the only one and I've seen a lot of people discussing \"what could they do next?\" which is awesome because last time we foresaw them pulling the rug at 300 and everyones reaction was just \"oh... ok, so hodl?\" \n\nNo one panics if everything goes to plan - weird clown guy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Yes I realise the news is fairly... \"short\" today, I expect it to become less and less as we get nearer to the shareholders meeting, this because well the company wont say shit now they'd rather bring it to the table on the annual shareholder meeting right?\n\nSo the only things I'd be able to get is information from the DTC/DTCC/FINRA/FINTEL/ and Data provided by awesome members we have here and outside of the sub. so don't worry we're just in a period that's called a \"silent period\" which a company usually has before meetings like this.\n\nWe don't know what the annual shareholders meeting will bring, but I'm excited as all hell.\n\n(also little side note, keep in mind we wont see shit happen on the Annual shareholder meeting because its after market close, we'll see the affects of it in the days/weeks after it \ud83d\ude09)\n\nSo stay classy, stay Jaqued!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2thk8upcm0371.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a0195860eb788c0fa04f4ddd36fdb5a7e2c3c5\n\n# EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\nRemember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7ho3lbfm0371.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe0efea8f6fd42e751aa468a6eb0060d92a4c6d\n\n \n\nremember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.\n\nbackups:\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\n**Countdown
