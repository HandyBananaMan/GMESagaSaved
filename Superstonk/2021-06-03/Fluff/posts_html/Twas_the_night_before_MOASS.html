<p>'Twas the night before MOASS and though it was late<br />
Just one creature was stirring, awake sat an ape<br />
The stocks were all purchased from the brokers with care<br />
In hopes that the tendieman soon would be there  </p>
<p>The chimplings were nestled all snug in their beds<br />
While visions of lambos danced in their heads<br />
My wife was satisfied by her boyfriend's cock<br />
While I stayed up all night to watch the ticks of the stock  </p>
<p>When out on the ticker there arose such a candle<br />
Had the hedgies finally been caught in their scandal?<br />
I opened up r/superstonk in a flash<br />
And saw FUD from the shills about a stock crash  </p>
<p>I checked that I had one more order to buy<br />
My 💎👐 would stop shills, whatever they try<br />
When what to my wandering eyes did appear<br />
But a rocket 🚀 with a sign saying "Apes Enter Here"  </p>
<p>When I saw the red bandana I knew<br />
This pilot here was Deep Fucking Value<br />
More rapid than eagles the rocket 🚀ascended<br />
And he whistled, and shouted, and yelled the hedgies were ended:  </p>
<p>"Fuck Kenny! Fuck Vlad!<br />
And fuck Robbinghood!<br />
Fuck Shitadel, Melvin,<br />
And all of their brood!  </p>
<p>To the top of the moon!" And the price, yes it rose<br />
"Now apes buy and hodl! Let the squeeze be squoze!<br />
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly<br />
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky  </p>
<p>So right past $10,000 the stonk price did rise<br />
Moving so fast it left tears in my eyes<br />
And then, in my smooth brain, I heard a voice<br />
"The DD was right! It's time to rejoice!"  </p>
<p>As I snacked on my crayons, the rocket 🚀 in motion<br />
I looked to my left and saw Ryan Cohen<br />
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot<br />
The man was dressed up in an ape suit  </p>
<p>"The votes are in," said he, "690%!<br />
Hedgies r fukd - they won't be left with a cent!"<br />
His eyes - how they twinkled! His memes, so merry!<br />
His cheeks were like ice cream 🍦 topped with a cherry!  </p>
<p>His grinning mouth was drawn up in a bow<br />
And the beard on his chin was as black as it could go<br />
His IPhone he held tight in his right hand<br />
I knew one tweet would send apes to tendieland  </p>
<p>His had a slim face and perfect, groomed hair<br />
That shook when he laughed, like the price of a share<br />
He was clever and wise, a right cunning short wrecker<br />
I cheered when I saw him and felt better and better  </p>
<p>A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head<br />
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread<br />
He spoke no more words, but went straight to work<br />
He tweeted just "🚀", then sat back with a smirk  </p>
<p>7 digits now! 8! A superstonk like no other!<br />
Margin had called! Hedgies were trying to cover!<br />
He called to DFV and gave him a whistle,<br />
And apes all flew up like the down of a thistle  </p>
<p>And I heard them exclaim, now apes knew they were right-<br />
"Happy MOASS to all, apes have won the fight!".</p>
