Remember when he posted the song Thats Life? 

That's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, 
shot down in May
*But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June*

He knew weeks before that he would be "shot down" or rather shut down in May, but he'd be back in June. The man is a genius. 💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋💎✋🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
