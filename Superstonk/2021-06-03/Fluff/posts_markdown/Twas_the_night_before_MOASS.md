'Twas the night before MOASS and though it was late  
Just one creature was stirring, awake sat an ape  
The stocks were all purchased from the brokers with care  
In hopes that the tendieman soon would be there  
  
The chimplings were nestled all snug in their beds  
While visions of lambos danced in their heads  
My wife was satisfied by her boyfriend's cock  
While I stayed up all night to watch the ticks of the stock  
  
When out on the ticker there arose such a candle  
Had the hedgies finally been caught in their scandal?  
I opened up r/superstonk in a flash  
And saw FUD from the shills about a stock crash  
  
I checked that I had one more order to buy  
My 💎👐 would stop shills, whatever they try  
When what to my wandering eyes did appear  
But a rocket 🚀 with a sign saying "Apes Enter Here"  

When I saw the red bandana I knew  
This pilot here was Deep Fucking Value  
More rapid than eagles the rocket 🚀ascended  
And he whistled, and shouted, and yelled the hedgies were ended:  

"Fuck Kenny! Fuck Vlad!  
And fuck Robbinghood!  
Fuck Shitadel, Melvin,  
And all of their brood!  

To the top of the moon!" And the price, yes it rose  
"Now apes buy and hodl! Let the squeeze be squoze!  
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly  
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky  

So right past $10,000 the stonk price did rise  
Moving so fast it left tears in my eyes  
And then, in my smooth brain, I heard a voice  
"The DD was right! It's time to rejoice!"  
  
As I snacked on my crayons, the rocket 🚀 in motion  
I looked to my left and saw Ryan Cohen  
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot  
The man was dressed up in an ape suit  

"The votes are in," said he, "690%!  
Hedgies r fukd - they won't be left with a cent!"  
His eyes - how they twinkled! His memes, so merry!  
His cheeks were like ice cream 🍦 topped with a cherry!  

His grinning mouth was drawn up in a bow  
And the beard on his chin was as black as it could go  
His IPhone he held tight in his right hand  
I knew one tweet would send apes to tendieland  

His had a slim face and perfect, groomed hair  
That shook when he laughed, like the price of a share  
He was clever and wise, a right cunning short wrecker  
I cheered when I saw him and felt better and better  
  
A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head  
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread  
He spoke no more words, but went straight to work  
He tweeted just "🚀", then sat back with a smirk  
  
7 digits now! 8! A superstonk like no other!  
Margin had called! Hedgies were trying to cover!  
He called to DFV and gave him a whistle,  
And apes all flew up like the down of a thistle  
  
And I heard them exclaim, now apes knew they were right-  
"Happy MOASS to all, apes have won the fight!".
