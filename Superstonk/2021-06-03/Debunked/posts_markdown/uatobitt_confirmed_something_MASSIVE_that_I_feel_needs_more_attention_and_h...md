#EDIT: DEBUNKED u/atobitt just clarified that he had gotten the information wrong, and that he had made a mistake with mixing up Citadel's Master Fund with its Global Fixed Income Fund. Thank you to the fellow apes who have pointed this out to me in the comments!

Hello my fellow apes! It's definitely been a while since I last posted; I've been trying to catch up on some schoolwork I have for a summer class and I finally got some time to crank out something. 

(Post that I was referring to further in:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqyy5a/whuh_really/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Usually when I type out posts like these, I try to base it off of information from other fellow apes that I feel needs more attention just so there could possibly be more eyes on the subject, as well as an interpretation that can help stimulate some further insight into the possibilities of the data whether it be from me or from some fellow apes in the comments.

As I was scrolling the sub for info, I had come across a post pointing out from u/atobitt himself confirming that Citadel's Master Fund had essentially liquidated a HUGE chunk of its assets(he had even commented on the post for some more clarification, and I think EVERYONE should check the post out and see what you think on the whole thing).

The whole idea, as far as I understand it (and u/atobitt please correct me if I'm wrong here), is essentially that Citadel's Master Fund is made up of the ownership of around 80% Cayman Island accounts, that originally had 123 billion$ in assets total in the fund as of December 2020. When he looked up the assets of the Master Fund from April/ May 2021 (and I'll provide the sauce he provided in his comment), he found out it currently has around 2 BILLION in assets left.

I would like for you to understand the gravity of what was just said here. 121 billion in assets, from Citadel's Master Fund that contains a majority of ownership from CAYMAN ISLAND accounts, went poof. Gone. Caput. Liquidated.

You might be asking me, "well where the hell is that money now?" and here is where my interpretation of things come into play. Just for further clarification, this is NOT what u/atobitt said, this is just how I'm interpreting the data he has presented to us;  but I believe Citadel got margin called, and couldn't put up the collateral to further keep their short position. Let me explain what I mean by that.

When someone gets margin called, as long as you can post collateral, you can continue to do WHATEVER the fuck you want. Citadel has likely been margin called multiple times at this point. It's when you can't keep up with the collateral that forced liquidations happen. Now I already hear some questions on that:

1. If they were "forcefully liquidated" why haven't we seen that reflected in the price?
2. How the hell are they still able to short the stock like they have been if they are being forcefully liquidated?

To answer that first question, I'm going to clarify on what I meant a bit. By getting "forcefully liquidated" I mean they are currently in the process of getting forcefully liquidated. The "covering" part of the liquidation hasn't happened yet and would possibly happen on T+35 of whenever they didn't meet the margin call (IF the DTCC is the one liquidating them, it would be a delay of up to T+ 35 compared to the normal T+5). However, just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it isn't reflected in the price.

Over these past couple of weeks, less shorting has been happening and its been harder for them to keep up with the price. This much can be evident by the lift off in price we're having in meme stocks overall. We knew that they had less fire power, and we knew that it was getting more expensive for them to maintain their position, we just couldn't point our finger to anything that would solidly prove that without a doubt. I think the data u/atobitt provided can provide proof that Citadel had been liquidated of a lot of their assets, and now the trigger finger is on the DTCC to pull on T+35 (and remember NO dates, this is not financial advice, but if this were to happen it would happen in the within the next month or two.)

To address the second point, we have to remember that Citadel is not the only one shorting GME and other meme stocks. There are multiple hedgies involved in this, so its possible that the reason we have still been seeing shorting to the extent that we have in spite of Citadel being in the process of forced liquidation is because the other hedgies are helping to keep the price down until they can't possibly kick the can down any longer on T+35.

CONCLUSION/TLDR:

The data that u/atobitt has provided us apes with regarding the 121 billion liquidation of Citadel's Master Fund, could possibly mean (in my interpretation of what he has presented) that the DTCC has taken over of a lot of Citadel's assets as a result of a failure to meet a margin call, and that we are in the process of seeing them being forcefully liquidated, which won't happen until T +35 of whenever they didn't meet the margin call.

Again, I would like to point out that it is completely possible that this IS NOT true as there are other ways to make sense of this, I am not claiming this is fact and I welcome all criticism against the points I've made here so we can all learn more about the subject and grow as a community. :)

As of right now when I'm typing this on my phone its 5am, so after I'm posting this I'm probably going to head to bed. Thank you all for reading through this (possible) DD and I hope you have a great rest of your day!

#EDIT 2: I have been seeing some comments asking me why this post is kept up despite it being debunked:

In general, I like to keep all of my posts up for transparency's sake, and on the off chance that someone who reads it can gain something from it, whether it be from my actual post or what was said in the comments. I don't want to just straight up delete the post just because I'm wrong when the comments could always have more useful information as well as discussion happening. In a way, I find the comments sometimes to be my favorite parts of posts for always having useful info as well as seeing what people think on things, and I'm glad that a subreddit like this has a community that can provide this in spades. Anyways, I'm just rambling at this point but in any case thank you for reading!
