<p>Call your broker to make sure that they are not loaning your shares, and that you are not on margin, and also REMOVE any stop losses.</p>
<p>A lot of brokers auto-loan your shares, especially if you are buying on margin/using a margin account.</p>
<p>(Robbinghoods is margin even when it says it isn't Fuck, RH).</p>
<p>*if you haven't yet... transfer out of RH*</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and Buy &amp; HODL.</p>

<p>This may seem like financial advice, but trust me when I tell you it isn't. I once snorted a gobstoppper up my nose and now I see SMURPLE.</p>
