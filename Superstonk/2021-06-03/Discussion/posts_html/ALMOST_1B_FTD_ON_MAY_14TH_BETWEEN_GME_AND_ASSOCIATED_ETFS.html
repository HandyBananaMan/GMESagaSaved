<p>Hello, fellow apes.  This is my second posting regarding FTDs, but as I mentioned in my first post, I built a tool to analyze the SEC FTD reports which I've update today.  It's <a href="https://github.com/failedtodeliver/failedtodeliver.com">open-source on Github</a>, why don't some of you wrinklier brained apes get in and help make it better.  I'd like to correlate options data but I don't have the money to spend on it (\~$1k).  All my extra money goes you know where</p>
<p>Here's the data crunched down -</p>

<p>THIS IS FUCKING HUGE!!!  We haven't seen numbers like this since December 2020.  What does this change?  Nothing, just some validation for you sweaty paper hands who are thinking about making the biggest mistake of their lives.  Things are boiling up to a massive event.  Could they delay it somehow or indefinitely?  Probably, but when December had numbers like this, they were early indicators of the January events.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> About $1B in value failed to deliver on May 14th between GME and associated ETFs.  The last time this happened was December 2020.  Remember what happened in January?</p>

<p>Not financial advice, but buy and hold my fellow apes.  Alpha Centauri will be beautiful.</p>
