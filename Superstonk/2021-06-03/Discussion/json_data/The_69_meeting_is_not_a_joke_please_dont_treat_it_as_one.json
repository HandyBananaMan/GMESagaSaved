Consider your own situation and decide for yourself if your visit would benefit GME, or if it would hurt it, or if it's a neutral visit. If your visit is not a positive one, then consider not going.\n\nIf you do have to go, treat it the same way you would treat a job interview or a first visit to the parents of your love interest. Dress decently, behave appropriately. \n\nWe all love making fun here and there's nothing wrong with that, but the public will not understand or accept that behavior, especially not in a formal setting. Don't give the media any ammonition to use against us. Not even on your way to the meeting or on your way out. \n\nFor the common good of GME, please stay formal in public.",
