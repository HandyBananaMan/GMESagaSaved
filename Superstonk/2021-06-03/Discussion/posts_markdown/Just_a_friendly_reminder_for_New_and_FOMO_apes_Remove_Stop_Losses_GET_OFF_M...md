Call your broker to make sure that they are not loaning your shares, and that you are not on margin, and also REMOVE any stop losses.

A lot of brokers auto-loan your shares, especially if you are buying on margin/using a margin account.

(Robbinghoods is margin even when it says it isn't Fuck, RH).

\*if you haven't yet... transfer out of RH\*

Oh yeah, and Buy & HODL.

This may seem like financial advice, but trust me when I tell you it isn't. I once snorted a gobstoppper up my nose and now I see SMURPLE.
