You have not only fucked yourself over, you have fucked over your family and any chance of building generational wealth. One day you are sitting in a dark room. It\u2019s still and quiet. You are alone with your thoughts. It then hits you just how bad you fucked up. Don\u2019t be that person. \n\nAbove all, remember this. There is no such thing as a paper handed ape. \n\nHodl the line. \n\nThis is not financial advice.\n\nEdit: cheers for the awards.",
