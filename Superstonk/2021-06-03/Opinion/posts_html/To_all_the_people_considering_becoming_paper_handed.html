<p>Imagine this. You make $100,000. You are proud of yourself, you made money. Then you see the stock climb. The price keeps climbing. You fear what you have done. You have not only fucked yourself over, you have fucked over your family and any chance of building generational wealth. One day you are sitting in a dark room. It’s still and quiet. You are alone with your thoughts. It then hits you just how bad you fucked up. Don’t be that person. </p>
<p>Above all, remember this. There is no such thing as a paper handed ape. </p>
<p>Hodl the line. </p>
<p>This is not financial advice.</p>
<p>Edit: cheers for the awards.</p>
