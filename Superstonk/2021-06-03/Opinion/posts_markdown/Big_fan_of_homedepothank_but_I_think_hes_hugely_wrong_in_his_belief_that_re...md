#Title: Big fan of homedepothank but I think he’s hugely wrong in his belief that retail hasn’t bought much since January and has basically just held what it had with a small trickle of buying. I don’t know about you apes but I’ve nearly tripled my mother fucking position since the sneeze.

This is a huge deal when it comes to the psychology of power. The presupposition that retail hasn’t participated much in the last five months takes away the power and responsibility of retail for any upward price movement. It makes apes nothing more than leaves blowing on the winds of long whales battling short whales. Personally, I believe the apes have been in charge of their destiny from the beginning, are themselves the King Kong long whale, and have several orders of magnitude more shares now than they did in January.

Edit: a comment said he used March, not January in his post about retail buying. Still, looks like retail has been buying hot and heavy since then too
