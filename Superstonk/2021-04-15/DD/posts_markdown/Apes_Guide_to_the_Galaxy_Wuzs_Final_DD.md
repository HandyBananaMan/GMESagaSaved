Ape's Guide to the Galaxy (Wuz's Final DD

\*\*\* A short fan fiction - posted on behalf of Wuz \*\*\*

This will be my final DD. I want to thank my private group and especially /u/beowulf77 for posting my DDs and allowing me to remain anonymous throughout this process. I feel as though these are the final questions I have not seen answered correctly, and feel a personal duty to inform the community about them. Nothing I have posted has been fully embraced even though I have been proven right, every - single - time. It takes a lot of courage to stand with opposing views and opinions and I thank everyone willing to stand with me.

**Everyone Can’t Win:**

The key to a great sports bookie is making sure you have equal bets on both sides of the line and you are profiting on the difference in odds - not on one side winning (otherwise the bookie will be liable). I.e. Both sides of the line are -110 and the sports book takes a 10% commission. If there are equal bets on both sides of the line the book can never lose. They will inevitably get a 20 point edge from the line and a 10 point edge from the commission. Most people don’t realize that the majority of the time you are not betting against the casino - but against other betters. This is why the borrow rate has been so low. The lender of the shares chooses the borrow rate and the bookie  needs more people on the other side of the line (lower borrow rate = more short shares borrowed). Blackrock is the biggest short lender and they need more people on the other side of the line to fulfill all the winners' bets because Shitadel and co. don’t have enough money to fulfill the winning bets - they need more losers and people on the other side of the “line”. Once you have something caught in a deathtrap why not let other prey fall into the same trap for less and increase your profit line? Blackrock controls the exact number of shares they are choosing to lend to shorts knowing they can handle that volume of short selling at the given time.

**Lighting the Fuse:**

There sure was a lot of liability protection talk in that 10-K filing from GameStop:

“To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.”

Many of us took this as a sign of the impending squeeze, which it is, but wrinkle brained apes realize that the true purpose of this verbiage is GameStop trying to cover the company/executive team from legal liabilities related to it. DFV is being actively sued for losses. Can you imagine the impending legal liabilities if GameStop issues a share recall or any action that can be perceived as a catalyst to a MOASS that brings down the entire market? I know lawyer’s offices from Chicago to New York are salivating already. This is one of the reasons why Ryan Cohan and Blackrock have not triggered the squeeze yet. They are staring at each other and the red button hoping the other will assume the liability. Just because they are on the same side doesn’t mean their interests line up in every scenario. Neither entity wants to be left holding the lighter to the fuse that will blow up Wall Street and the world economy. I think it’s simply a cherry on top if the DTCC regulations come into place to give protection to market integrity pre-squeeze. The real reason they haven’t triggered it yet is they are hoping they don’t have to be the ones to do it (you go, no you go… no you go).

**Not all Calls are Friendlies:**

If you haven’t read my first DD I suggest you take a look because I believe it is super relevant to this week’s price action.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m33en4/not\_all\_calls\_are\_friendlies](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m33en4/not_all_calls_are_friendlies)

I believe the call option chain this week is Ken and company's final hoorah and they are praying for the gamma to create a false ceiling. I predict we will end this week under 200 to avoid the 25k in calls that they could use to reshort. Ironically, it is my belief that the current price manipulation downwards and rerouting of orders this week is mostly from our longs trying to prevent the shorts calls from activating. Any mechanism our enemy abuses you can be damn sure our side knows/uses as well. The true crimes of Citadel need to be investigated and I hope that anyone reading the Better Markets filing realizes how closely it mirrors my last DD:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mn5d8j/order\_flow\_and\_options\_manipulators\_the\_heinous/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mn5d8j/order_flow_and_options_manipulators_the_heinous/)

This is the true crime perpetrated by Citadel and I hope Ken and his team rots in jail for the billions of dollars he has stolen from the public abusing order flow, options, and volatility in our markets. Nothing is random. If you feel our longs have control of the situation they are most certainly the ones holding us at max pain to bleed out the shorts options.

**The North Star (our ultimate indicator):**

Now onto the controversial section of my final post: Keith Gill. There’s no better marketing story than an underdog making it huge. It is certainly believable that a day-trader could sniff out this miraculous play and make a $50,000 y0l0 into a $40 mil windfall… On camera/documented nonetheless. Definitely possible and a great feel good story. But then to sell 9 mil of options perfectly @ 300-350 \[edit: for clarity - he did not sell SHARES\]? Wow another lottery win… Ok. Still POSSIBLE, highly unlikely, but possible. But then to buy the bottom @ 38-40 that starts the next run to 300+? Ok… this is no longer a probable situation. This is like winning the lottery three times… in a row... and Babe Ruth pointing it out of the park all. three. times. I’m not sure when DFV became an asset for Blackrock/RC, but to me nothing of this magnitude or statistical improbability is random. It’s very possible DFV started his 50k yolo without Blackrock/RC, but his confidence and date calling makes me think otherwise. Take from that what you will, but I challenge you to ask ANY trader if they have ever seen ANYONE in HISTORY make 50k into 40 mil and then sell the exact top and buy the exact bottom - it is literally a statistical improbability. Here is why this is important to us Apes: Keith has batted 1.000 on every single trade. It is my prediction that he will post his options exercised Friday after market and this will be our final indicator that the squeeze is on next week. I like betting on the guy that has a perfect track record and I suggest you watch him very, very closely as it would make the most sense for RC/Blackrock to use him as the spark that ultimately lights the fuse. He will be the one with the largest public backing/protection, the least to lose of any friendly entity, and ultimately he will carry the burden of the sacrificial lamb that the longs can point to as the final catalyst to the MOASS.

I will post three edits to this piece that will go in throughout the day, so check back for more updates.

Edit 1:

Counter DD

As I stated in my previous posts I am biased as I am deep long. I think it’s only fair I give you the correct counter DD to mine:

Situation 1: The shorts are inflicting max pain on retail and preventing the gamma and have complete control over price. This would mean the long whales lost and retail is fucked short term. If the shorts have complete control over price retail is destined to head back to their determined max pain and “fundamental value”.

Situation 2: Blackrock/Vanguard have made backroom deals with Citadel to take over their portfolio and help Melvin and the other shorts unwind because the fallout is too large for them to control. Think Credit Suisse takeover but on a larger scale. A few signatures from Ken and Gabe, 250k in plastic surgery and they will soon be living their best life in Monaco or any country without extradition.

Situation 3: The shorts covered on the two run ups to 300+. Short interest is correct and now they are feeding themselves with new shorts all positioned over 200 and preventing our gammas with ETF shorting/sells/borrowed share sells. There are no long whales Blackrock and Vanguard are simply playing both sides to protect the market and profit from the lending and their share value.

If you assume one of these situations is true, the best response is the same: Buy the dip and hold. This will turn into a war of attrition that retail can still win. It will just literally be everyone vs. retail. I pledge to not sell a single share before the next year's shareholder’s meeting (2022) if no moass before then. I also apologize in advance to anyone reading my DD’s that decided to buy GME because of my DDs and ended up losing money. The responsibility for those losses is mine, and I promise you that I will end up losing more as a result.

P.S. I could very well be wrong about DFV and he's a time travelling trading god... Either way I still see him as our North Star and best indicator

Final Edit:
Since there was some depressing shit at the end of this DD let’s just skip to the fun stuff. If there is a MOASS I will be buying multiple penthouse Aria Sky Suites in Vegas with the homies. Anyone that can prove they commented positively on any of my DD’s before today is invited - dates TBA. Baby girl /u/redchessqueen99 is invited along with all the other mods wives/girlfriends (no seriously watch them like a hawk or they might get scooped). Spoiler alert:WE WILL BE DANCING ALL FUCKING NIGHT LONG.

EDIT: /u/beowulf77 here... I edited the dfv portion regarding him 'selling at the top' to clarify. Wuz clearly was referring to the options he unloaded not any shares. I hope that clears it up. Thank you.
