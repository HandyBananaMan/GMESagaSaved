<p>People were starting to lose hope.. it looked like we had just been majorly fucked by the trade limit imposed by Robbinghood and other cuck-brokerages
Shit was gloomy as hell.. I wont lie I thought we were done for.. </p>
<p>me and my gf were talking about what are we going to do now, I was dumb and bought more than I could afford which left me with a hole in my chest when I saw the price decline to 38$. We decided then and there, we HODL, for as long as it takes for gamestop to grow and even our losses out. THEN IT HAPPENED</p>
<p>DFV had just been asked hours earlier on the hearing if he would still buy GME, which he basically replied ”Fuck yea” to.
And I will never forget the first update post on his position .. THIS FUCKER BOUGHT EVEN MORE 
That shit sent chills through my body, I felt like my fire was rekindled, I was ready to hold for a bazillion years. I was back in the fight, never been uncertain since, fucking aye.</p>
