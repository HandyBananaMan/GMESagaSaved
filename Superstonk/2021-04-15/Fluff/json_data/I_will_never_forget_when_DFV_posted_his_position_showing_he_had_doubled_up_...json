I wont lie I thought we were done for.. \n\nme and my gf were talking about what are we going to do now, I was dumb and bought more than I could afford which left me with a hole in my chest when I saw the price decline to 38$. We decided then and there, we HODL, for as long as it takes for gamestop to grow and even our losses out. THEN IT HAPPENED\n\nDFV had just been asked hours earlier on the hearing if he would still buy GME, which he basically replied \u201dFuck yea\u201d to.\nAnd I will never forget the first update post on his position .. THIS FUCKER BOUGHT EVEN MORE \nThat shit sent chills through my body, I felt like my fire was rekindled, I was ready to hold for a bazillion years. I was back in the fight, never been uncertain since, fucking aye.",
