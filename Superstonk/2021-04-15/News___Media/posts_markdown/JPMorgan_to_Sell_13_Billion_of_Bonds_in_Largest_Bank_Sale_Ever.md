TL:DR from the second link above:

 Remember‚ùóHedgies aren't just shorting GME to oblivion. They've been doing this to US Treasury Bonds. Particularly 10 year ones. If that implodes, then the government can no longer guarantee the value of its own dollar, because those "insurance policies" i.e. US bonds are worthless=Dollar go boom üí• Treasury Secretary Yellen called a meeting to seemingly stop that boom.
