<p>Good morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole,</p>
<p>Do you smell that?</p>
<p>*insert flashy intro card*</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/eu4nrnsuuat61.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fd1a17f30577791d5f7f3372ed3157c2a1a2f45</p>
<p>None of this is financial advice, I'm just an ape who found a typewriter with an internet connection</p>
<p>So lets go people!</p>
<p>First of let's start with the two form-4's that went up yesterday</p>
<p><a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18806/html">https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18806/html</a></p>
<p><a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18801/html">https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18801/html</a></p>
<p>Both George Sherman (current CEO) and Chris Homeister (current EVP and CMO) have both got their bananas yeeted from them, Due to "not meeting targets", in other words they didn't do their job the old board would've let them get away with it but the current one does not.</p>
<p>George Sherman had to forfeit 587,248 Shares</p>
<p>Chris Homeister had to forfeit 119,048 Shares</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Dividends</h1>
<p>I've seen some talk across the board regarding the Dividends and people think dividends are an automatic shoe in at this point, but don't count on it, read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqmsvf/re_gamestop_2021_dividends_speculation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">This</a></p>
<p>Again try to remain level headed, even though we would love to see things like this happen immediately, remember the company is doing a lot of stuff right now  and we have to look at all possibilities right now, so read the post I linked as it seems well thought out</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/xzeztwbayat61.gif">DFV</a></p>
<h1>DFV options chain</h1>
<p>Ok so again this is something I've seen pop up here in the past few days, when DFV executes his orders it would cause a squeeze! no sorry guys, these have been hedged a long time ago and this wouldn't cause any big movements.</p>
<p>it's good to be excited but please remain realistic.</p>
<p>Once it got near his number the broker would've bought them already and held them, this is simple market mechanics.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>SLGG</p>
<p>Now this is something that I came across on the boards again, remember RC being in California and people where wondering if he was there to look for partnerships or a new CEO.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Super league Gaming 10k form</p>
<p><a href="https://ir.superleague.com/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0001654954-21-003010/0001654954-21-003010.pdf">https://ir.superleague.com/sec-filings/annual-reports/content/0001654954-21-003010/0001654954-21-003010.pdf</a></p>

<p>The "amateur" sector is one of the harder sectors to reach for esports, but it seems there may be a partnership coming if I read this correctly, as SLGG doesn't have any Retail factions... who could it be?</p>
<p>Not a sure thing by any means but it's nice to see regardless.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Y'all remember this one?</p>
<p>Good onto Book 2, chapter 1 Advanced Fuckery part 1.</p>
<p>Yesterday I came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqxp74/the_biggest_threat_to_moass_youtube_live/">this</a> thread, and I tend to agree, even though Youtube people do have a place in all of this, remember that what OP posted there could very well be real.</p>
<p>The post goes over a hypothetical, if a YT is bought off and during the squeeze they say what the paying party wants them to say. (again not saying this as a fact but as possibility).</p>
<p>Again plan your own exit strategy, make your own plans, do not count on others to make it for you and set the prices however high or low you would like them to be. it's your money and your shares and you should act to that. I briefly mentioned this last week, but feel like this should be reiterated.</p>
<p>Do your own legwork, look at existing strategies that are online and see how YOU want to do YOURS</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Like this guy, he gets it, do your own research, do your own planning and act accordingly.</p>
<p>that's the best advice I can give everyone, do your own work, your own research and your own exit strategy (no we do not have a set one for everyone, nor will we agree on we all sell at X price, this is collusion and illegal and won't be allowed on this sub).</p>
<p>just... please do your own work and exit strategy guys.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
<p>If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.</p>
