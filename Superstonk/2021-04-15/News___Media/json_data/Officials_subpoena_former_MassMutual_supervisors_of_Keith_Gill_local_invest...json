Gill resigned from MassMutual in January. State regulators subpoenaed Gill in February to investigate the matter, and he testified remotely on March 3 in a private teleconference with securities regulators.\n\nRelated: Brockton track star becomes stock market millionaire: an unlikely Wall Street success story\n\nThe office of Secretary of State William Galvin said Gill\u2019s former supervisors are expected to testify privately in late April or early May. A spokesperson for MassMutual said the company continues to \u201cfully cooperate with all regulatory reviews.\u201d\n\nGill\u2019s lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.",
