So there is a whole hour of work that I have to do after market close. And since I couldn't watch the ticker anymore and ran out of crayons I started wondering what to expect once the rocket launched.
Everyone is saying the rocket will take days. But how many days is it?

Also a lot of people may be afraid of missing the rocket.
And I have seen a lot of dd recently about the 5-10 minute break strategy. (Which I think is brilliant)

This is not advice. I'm an idiot.



So the market will freeze at a 10% increase in price. And it will freeze for 5-15 minutes.

So if the rocket started at the 4/15/21 closing price of $156.44 and did nothing but go up, without any dips how long would it take?

So lets say it goes up 10% and there is a freeze, then it goes up another 10% and freezes again.

It will take 117 10% increments like that to get to my rock bottom floor of $10 mil a share.

Assuming it takes 1 minute to increase 10% (just because that is what my candles are set at and I love those crayons)

So if they only froze for 5 minute intervals the whole way up:

117×6 (1 min of shreck dick and 5 min of freeze) = 702 minutes.
That's 11.7 hours, or 1.8 trading days.

What if they froze for 10 minutes each?

117x11=1287 min. Or 21.5 hrs. Or 3.3 trading days.

How about freezing for the maximum of 15 minutes each time?

117×16=1872 min. 31.2 hrs. 4.8 trading days.

What if your floor is $100 mil a share?

$100 mil a share is 141 10% increases from our current $156.44 closing price.

So at

5 min freezes:
846 min, 14.1 hrs, 2.2 trading days

10 min freezes:
1551 min, 25.9 hrs, 4 trading days

15 min freezes:
2256 min, 37.6 hrs, 5.8 trading days


I wanted to know these and thought others might as well. I know it's not as impressive as other dds.

But my take away from this is that it will not require any immediate or fast action.
When the rocket launches take a walk for 5-10 min. Eat some crayons. Look at memes. Whatever you want.  There is no rush.  Just relax and hodl to the top.

A lot of people are getting impatient for the rocket to start. I am one of those people. I am absolutely jacked to the tits!
But the rocket will happen when it happens. And even then tendies are DAYS away. 
These calculations aren't even taking into consideration any slowdowns or valleys there will be along the way.

Just be patient, relax, drink water, think before you do anything, and I will see you on the moon.

TA;DR: It will take days to reach the moon. There is no rush. Relax and enjoy the ride.

Edit: I don't know how to format this better.
Sorry.
