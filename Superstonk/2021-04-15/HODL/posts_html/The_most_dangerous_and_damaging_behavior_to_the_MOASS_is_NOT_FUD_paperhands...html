<p>Don't expect Hedgies to hand us millions of dollars without putting up a good fight. We are fighting to change the financial system and make money, they are fighting to survive. It's a matter of life and death to them. It's a matter of bending over to the little guy and "dumb money" as they call it. </p>
<p>Don't expect an easy win. You have to work hard for your tendies and ride the psychological roller-coaster. If we win, we will win forever, if they lose they will die, and they will be buried under the Charging Bull Sculpture on WallStreet. I beg you to remember, there is no room for panic-mongers and deserters.</p>
