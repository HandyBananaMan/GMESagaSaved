It's a matter of life and death to them. It's a matter of bending over to the little guy and \"dumb money\" as they call it. \n\nDon't expect an easy win. You have to work hard for your tendies and ride the psychological roller-coaster. If we win, we will win forever, if they lose they will die, and they will be buried under the Charging Bull Sculpture on WallStreet. I beg you to remember, there is no room for panic-mongers and deserters.",
