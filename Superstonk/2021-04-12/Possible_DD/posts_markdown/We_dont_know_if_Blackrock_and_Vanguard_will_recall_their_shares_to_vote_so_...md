They didn't recall their shares last year and there was [still a squeeze that nearly doubled the price.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1585699200&period2=1587168000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true) We know from the excellent DD of others that there are potentially millions of synthetic shares out there, and an institution recalling their shares might cause MOASS. We know that Blackrock supported Cohen in the past with Chewy and it seems likely that they will do so again, but it is not guaranteed. They [did not do so last year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-investing-giants-gave-away-voting-power-ahead-of-a-shareholder-fight-11591793863) and again, there *was* a squeeze, just not a **MOASS**. 

We also know that there are plenty of changes at the DTCC and SEC that could cause the MOASS by changing the reporting requirements. Lots of things could cause it. I am seeing a lot of posts today about Vanguard recalling and needing statements by 4/20, which to me seems like it might be a fake squeeze/FUD tactic to make people think that if things don't happen by then, or we get a jump like last April, that will be the squeeze. 

Based on everything I've seen, I believe the real MOASS will be when either the institutional whales recall their shares **OR** when reporting requirements reveal the true depth of the naked short selling and shorts are forced to cover. That is all going to happen soon, but is not necessarily tied to 4/20. Remember all the posts about ignoring dates and hodling for months? That may still be in the cards. Don't loose sight of what we have known about this thing for weeks just because some Vanguard rep sent an ambiguously worded email to an ape. I am going to hodl until we see a 6 or 7 digit floor and not a moment before. I hope other apes do the same, but none of this is financial advice, I just like the stock.
