Even throughout the hodl during the February $40 dip, I still had some nagging doubts. Not anymore. Only time I care about the ticker is when I go to buy more. Patience. Relax. It will come.

Edit: Thx for awards and positivity. Apes together strong! Buy the dips and hodl :)

Edit 2: I‚Äôm only HODLING X shares cuz that‚Äôs all I can afford. Makes me feel good to see how many GORILLAS are out there picking up my slack. Buy an extra one for me ü§ù
