As you can see below there were no deep in-the-money calls purchased today.\n\n[GME Biggest Trades 4-12-2021](https://preview.redd.it/3mgbwc7d1us61.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6ea20eb0c904426db05e0407ead39af6ac971af)\n\nThis makes 5 out of the last 6 days with no large block trades of DEEP ITM calls. The one day being a relatively small amount (compared to prior block purchases). Short and sweet today. Hang in there (pun intended)",
