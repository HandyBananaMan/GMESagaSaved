Good evening Apes I hope this post finds you well,

I'm your host u/Dan_Bren lets get right into it:

Wanted to provide you all with an update for today. As you can see below there were no deep in-the-money calls purchased today.

![GME Biggest Trades 4-12-2021](https://preview.redd.it/3mgbwc7d1us61.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6ea20eb0c904426db05e0407ead39af6ac971af)

This makes 5 out of the last 6 days with no large block trades of DEEP ITM calls. The one day being a relatively small amount (compared to prior block purchases). Short and sweet today. Hang in there (pun intended)
