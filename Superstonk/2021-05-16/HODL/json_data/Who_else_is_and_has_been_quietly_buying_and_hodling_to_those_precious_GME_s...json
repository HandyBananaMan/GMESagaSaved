All the relatively new apes don't know this and only have been reading DDs and opinion based posts that have been created in the past few weeks and it could be enough to shake their core, making them lose faith in the inevitable that is the GME MOASS. \n\nNow more than ever, we all need to assure one another and encourage them to go back to the roots, the simple mantra of BUY AND HODL. No other DD or information, FUD or shill attempts will make me forget that.\n\nFrom henceforth, I will add BUY AND HODL, SHORTS MUST COVER quote at the end of every comment I make so the new apes know what to do. Hopefully this can spread out so regardless of any FUDing, apes only need to buy and hodl.",
