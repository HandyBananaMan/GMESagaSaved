**TITLE SHOULD READ: BE WARY OF YOUTUBERS. Iâ€™M NOT SAYING STOP WATCHING THEM BUT BE CAUTIOUS. BE ALERT. ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS WARDENELITE DRAMA.**

Please be a friendly ape and remind your fellow apes that watching or following youtubers right now is a very bad idea. They can easily be bought and can easily make people paperhand. Just by their actions and expressions, they can spread deep internal FUD.

Watching a potential shill during the MOASS is akin to watching someone puke in front of you after you've both eaten the same food. It will be hard to hold it in. The only difference is this guy's being paid to puke and you've actually eaten delicious tendies.

Most APES are diamond hands at this point, but there are a few lil' APES who need our strength and support to continue to HODL.

**Never lose sight of why you bought, why you hodl and why you voted.**

EDIT 1: APES, be vigilante is all I'm saying. Anyone doing this for money outside of GME tendies should be looked at with a bit of skepticism. They could potentially be paid off to shill, we don't know. The upcoming levels are going to be harder and harder so be wary of FUD and stay true to the reason we're here. APES BUY, HODL and VOTE.

EDIT 2: For example, WARDEN was one of the mods and some people looked up to him. Look at the mess he left behind this weekend. Stay vigilante. NO SINGLE BETRAYAL IS WORTH THE ENTIRE APE COMMUNITY. APES TOGETHER STRONG, ALWAYS.

**EDIT 3: Watching Matt Kors right now and he's not even talking about GME, he's just focusing on AMC.**
