<p>First off, the media will lie about the hedge funds going bankrupt to try to make people sell so they won't go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Second, them going bankrupt is just the beginning of the real squeeze and when the dtcc will have to start buying. Citadel will go bankrupt waaaaayyyyy earlier than anyone's $10 million floor. </p>
<p>Lastly, I'm throwing shares in the Infinity pool because this isn't over for me until people go to prison. Not jail. Not pay fines. PRISON. When the tide pulls back and we see who is naked, PRISON! Msm/journalists that are being paid to lie to the masses. PRISON! Government officials that have allowed this, PRISON! Follow the money Gary! Lock these pieces of shit up! These fuckers put millions of peoples financial futures at risk willingly. They will more than likely not only break our economy but the world economy also. Yes, I know, I will be holding a long time to make this happen, probably forever!(edited to add probably forever) That's why it's the infinity pool.</p>
