<p>TLDR; BUY, HODL AND VOTE. SHORTS MUST COVER ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>I've been in the GME game since Feb 1, right after the Robinhood's trade halt and the downright shocking and horrifying drop from $480 to $40 in matter of days, (went all in like a true retard at $284 without thinking it may go down lower thanks to FOMO but now I've learned my lesson) and those days were filled with dread and fear that the shorts may bring it down to the ground, since they were able to bring it down by more than 90% of the stock's value. </p>
<p>But every diamond handed apes held onto those shares and bought more when they got the chance and so did I and still am buying when I can, considerably brought the average down and more than tripled down since Feb 1.</p>
<p>All these attempts of FUD and shills have done nothing but steel the ape's resolve because all the necessary information has been laid out before the mass migration from r/GME to r/Superstonk; that the SI is beyond anyone can imagine, there are far more shares out there than the actual float and the shorts must cover.</p>
<p>All the other information and DD that other wrinkly brained apes come up with, they're nice, but they only serve to enhance the original 3 point thesis I've mentioned above. </p>
<p>The veteran apes know this and aren't bothered by the FUD and shill attempts. All the relatively new apes don't know this and only have been reading DDs and opinion based posts that have been created in the past few weeks and it could be enough to shake their core, making them lose faith in the inevitable that is the GME MOASS. </p>
<p>Now more than ever, we all need to assure one another and encourage them to go back to the roots, the simple mantra of BUY AND HODL. No other DD or information, FUD or shill attempts will make me forget that.</p>
<p>From henceforth, I will add BUY AND HODL, SHORTS MUST COVER quote at the end of every comment I make so the new apes know what to do. Hopefully this can spread out so regardless of any FUDing, apes only need to buy and hodl.</p>
