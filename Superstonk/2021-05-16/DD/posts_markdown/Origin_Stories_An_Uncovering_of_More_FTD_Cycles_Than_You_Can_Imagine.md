It been well proven that GameStop price action experiences the effects of a 21-day Failure to Deliver (FTD) cycle. To catch some up to speed, here’s Hank:

>Brokers are allowed T+13 days to merely locate the aforementioned share that they shorted. HOWEVER, they can satisfy the locate requirement with YET ANOTHER borrowed share, which will follow a T+6 settlement. – u/HomeDepotHank69

**This becomes a total of 21 days.**

The result of this action, as showcased by the wonderfully created visual by [u/1mag1n3\_cgh](https://www.reddit.com/user/1mag1n3_cgh/), is a significant price increase on the 21st day.

[Massive increases each 21st day](https://preview.redd.it/afzyc5ht3kz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=182a6d488aa855434746841106e93e255f410220)

**But… what if I were to tell you that this is only a fraction of the story?** This DD serves to demonstrate that the prior articulation of a 21 day cycle is only slightly correct. In the truest sense of the phrase, but wait… there’s more.

**A couple housekeeping notes so that I can sleep at night and don’t get Pixel’d, Warden’d or otherwise cancelled:**

* This is not financial advice. I just like the stock and avoiding my work.
* Here’s your trigger warning for dates. The data presented below would allow an ape with at least one wrinkle to project with reasonable probability the next substantially green day. I’ll stop short of that in this write up.
* To be extra clear, I’m not suggesting that the MOASS will start on a specific date.
* Manage your risk. Don’t ruin your life based on the words some rando wrote on the internet.
* Know what’s meaningful to you. Everyone entered at a different point and everyone will exit at different points. While many will have the same belief in a squeeze, you gotta do what's best for you.

**Alright, let's get to it. We need to check ourselves.**

We’ve become spoiled. So eager for the MOASS that we think it’s only happening when we see a monster day of 15%+ gains. I’m with you – these do feel good. However, **from the perspective of nearly every other stock in the market, even a 3% green day is a wonderful, uncommon, and solid achievement**. For GME, it's confirmation that whatever is happening, the game has not stopped. In fact, the prevalence of of solidly green days that were seemingly random on the single FTD cycle visual DD is what made me start to feel suspicious that we've blinded ourselves to another reality that there could be other truths. Specifically, more cycles.

A few questions that sparked in my head when reviewing the visual DD:

* **Some days the price is 3+% green on days outside of the 21 day cycle**. If that is an objectively substantial increase and they control buying pressure, **why?**
* **Some days the price goes down significantly**. If we aren’t selling and the float is owned, one must assume these will have to become a part of an FTD cycle. **When** does it end?
* **There was a multi-day run in early March**. **How?**

**After investigating these questions, I discovered that there have been at least SIX 21-day FTD cycles. It’s my belief that at least FIVE remain active.**

Here is my laughable crayon drawing identifying each of the potential 21-day FTD cycles. Each color aligns with a cycle. The bold dotted lines identify what I believe to be the origin of the element of this vicious short scam cycle.

[Yeah, I'm big timin' with the 64 color set](https://preview.redd.it/ckhm8a9k8kz61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3723f0020d990d771f5c623f58260daa3759a70f)

Want just the cycles? A'ight. I got you. (Edit: changed ~~dates~~ to cycles)

Because this is near impossible to see, here’s the data smoothed out for you to identify each 21st day within each cycle.

![Ken, I got the receipts](https://preview.redd.it/txnq447u5kz61.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da92b5130f2e76fa277d778cace4d11085ad95b)

**So, I’m going to hold myself to my own test and ask: why?**

Let's have some fun though. Maybe you apes know the answer to each of these (edit: directions for smooth brains: hold down on the gray rectangles to reveal the answer):

*Why didn’t it happen on January 8?* >!They dropped the price by 5% from $18.08 to $17.08 (-5%) and it rose 3.5% from lows. !<

*Why didn’t it happen on March 26?* >!March 26 is Black's day to locate. However, March 25 was Red's and the price rose 53%. My suspicion is that either Mr. Black and Mr. Red are the same psychopath and are massively short or Mr. Black and Mr. Red ended up competing to locate shares on the 25th given their cycles are so tight, which is why price skyrocketed..!<

*Why didn’t it happen on April 5?* >!They dropped the price -14% from the prior day's close during pre-market and it closed the day only -2%. Anyone who bought the dip had a great day.!<

*Why didn’t it happen on April 13?* >!They did it after hours. 4% increase from $140.99 to $146.98.!<

*Why didn’t it happen on May 4?* >!They dropped the price to from $162.20 prior day close to $155.45 by mid-day. The price then recovered to close a high of $164.59 after hours… about 6% increase after hours.!<

*Why didn’t it happen on May 12?* >!The price was dropped to $142.23, then rose to a high of $150.49 before selling off for the rest of the day. They probably increased their short position.!<

TA;DR – **Our eagerness for a 10%+ day blinded us to the massive multiples of 21-day FTD cycles.** In fact, each solid green day can be tracked back to an origin date at which a substantial short position was established. Some cycle dates are disguised as modestly red due to Ken & Co. doing their dirty work while apes sleep or tend to their families. And, there are many of these origin dates. At times, they are obvious as it is a substantially red day. Other times, it’s hidden in pre-market, after hours, or a during substantial event like earnings.

See you next time…

This DD has roots in a few other write ups I'm working on. In fact, it really only came from the process of researching for the sake of researching. There's still more work to be done and I'm happy to collaborate along the way. Here's where I'm focused next:

* On-Balance-Volume – Brought to my attention as a technical indicator by the late Warden, On-Balance-Volume indicates the net increase or decrease in shares purchased vs sold. It’s been critical in our confirmation that retail is not selling. Could this be a helpful clue-finder to learning of the magnitude of each cycle’s origin?
* How does a cycle end? Can it?
* Does price behave in similar cycles immediately prior or after the 21st day?

Edit: Soon to be verified update 
Was April 16th the initiation of another FTD cycle? I cover this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nehluy/april_16_an_ftd_origin_story/
