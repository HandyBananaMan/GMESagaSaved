We know you lurk here. You know what just transpired with Warden. Lowball floors; recommending stop losses; recommending market orders over limit orders; outright telling us when to sell - **all of which were overwhelmingly rejected by the apes of r/Superstonk**.

Literally within two hours of Warden posting his shit, he was writing his resignation and is no longer a mod.

The apes know exactly how valuable these shares are to you.

But guess what? **We ain’t selling for anything less than world-changing tendies**. The apes have gone through too much shit to settle for lowball numbers.

**$20 million floor is not a meme.**

Edit 1: the deleted post by Warden:

Edit 2: $10 mil to $20 mil. The floor for a stock that is shorted **multiple times** the number of existing, legitimate shares is whatever apes decide to sell at. And there are **a lot** of apes going for higher floors in other threads (and in the comments below). 🚀🚀🚀🚀
