The kid screwed up. He’s been dealt the consequences, let’s not continue the hate and drive this fella into a pit of depression. 

Ape no fight ape, right?

We all knew he was a 22 year old kid with limited trading experience. He was transparent about that from the beginning. He went from zero to hero real quick and chances are his ego got the best of him.

Let’s let him leave in peace to learn from his mistakes and continue on our merry way.

Side note: maybe we should consider removing posts bashing him? I don’t believe it looks good on the sub from outsiders to see the blatant and targeted hate... some apes are ruthless, god damn orangoutangs. (Still love ya)


Just my two cents, as always, hodling til my hands seize shut.

Edit: added some love.

Edit #2: I’ve received both the all seeing upvote and faith in humanity restored award anonymously, within seconds of each other. 

.. I can only hope the great DFV is watching over.
