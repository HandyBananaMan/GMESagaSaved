    "selftext": "The kid screwed up. He\u2019s been dealt the consequences, let\u2019s not continue the hate and drive this fella into a pit of depression. \n\nApe no fight ape, right?\n\nWe all knew he was a 22 year old kid with limited trading experience. He was transparent about that from the beginning. He went from zero to hero real quick and chances are his ego got the best of him.\n\nLet\u2019s let him leave in peace to learn from his mistakes and continue on our merry way.\n\nSide note: maybe we should consider removing posts bashing him? I don\u2019t believe it looks good on the sub from outsiders to see the blatant and targeted hate... some apes are ruthless, god damn orangoutangs. (Still love ya)\n\n\nJust my two cents, as always, hodling til my hands seize shut.\n\nEdit: added some love.\n\nEdit #2: I\u2019ve received both the all seeing upvote and faith in humanity restored award anonymously, within seconds of each other. \n\n.. I can only hope the great DFV is watching over.",
