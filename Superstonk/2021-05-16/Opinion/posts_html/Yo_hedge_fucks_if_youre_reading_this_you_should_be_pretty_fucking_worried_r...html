<p>We know you lurk here. You know what just transpired with Warden. Lowball floors; recommending stop losses; recommending market orders over limit orders; outright telling us when to sell - <strong>all of which were overwhelmingly rejected by the apes of r/Superstonk</strong>.</p>
<p>Literally within two hours of Warden posting his shit, he was writing his resignation and is no longer a mod.</p>
<p>The apes know exactly how valuable these shares are to you.</p>
<p>But guess what? <strong>We ain’t selling for anything less than world-changing tendies</strong>. The apes have gone through too much shit to settle for lowball numbers.</p>
<p><strong>$20 million floor is not a meme.</strong></p>

<p>Edit 1: the deleted post by Warden:</p>

<p>Edit 2: $10 mil to $20 mil. The floor for a stock that is shorted <strong>multiple times</strong> the number of existing, legitimate shares is whatever apes decide to sell at. And there are <strong>a lot</strong> of apes going for higher floors in other threads (and in the comments below). 🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
