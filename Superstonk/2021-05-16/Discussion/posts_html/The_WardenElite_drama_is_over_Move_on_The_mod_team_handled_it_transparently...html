<h1>Title: The WardenElite drama is over. Move on. The mod team handled it transparently and efficiently. Warden apologized. He is no longer a mod. Can we please go back to being excellent to one another?</h1>

<p>I love this community and all the apes that inhabit it. This sub is like an oasis in a desert of shit. Ape help ape. Ape no fight ape. APE TOGETHER STRONG. But sadly, after the drama in the last 24 hours, it seems every post has comments slinging shit at Warden. He fucked up. He knows it. The mods dealt with it professionally. Be like Elsa and "Let It Go!" WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS! </p>
<p>That is all. </p>
<p>TO THE MOON!</p>
