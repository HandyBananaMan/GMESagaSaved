I saw the tweet from Trimbath, claiming the US needs to adapt the FTD rules from the EU.

So, if she says the rules in Frankfurt are better, why should we not buy our shares in a better regulated market?

Just something I’m wondering about. Don’t mind me, I’m just a DD reader, I don’t have too much wrinkles.
