<p>I saw the tweet from Trimbath, claiming the US needs to adapt the FTD rules from the EU.</p>
<p>So, if she says the rules in Frankfurt are better, why should we not buy our shares in a better regulated market?</p>
<p>Just something I’m wondering about. Don’t mind me, I’m just a DD reader, I don’t have too much wrinkles.</p>
