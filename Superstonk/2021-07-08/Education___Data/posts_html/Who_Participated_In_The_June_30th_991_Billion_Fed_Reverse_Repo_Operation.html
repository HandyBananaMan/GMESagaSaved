<p>In this thread I provide a breakdown of the 90 participants in the June 30th $991.9 billion reverse repo (RRP) operation. It was mostly Money Market Funds (MMFs).</p>
<p>Table link here: <img alt="https://i.imgur.com/fPsUCH9.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/fPsUCH9.png" /></p>
<p>Out of the 90 counterparties, 77 MMF counterparties participated to the tune of $855 billion(86%). So who were the other 13 non-MMF participants? Most likely Government-Sponsored Enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and possibly other participants on the following list who used the remaining $136 billion(14%). (or some MMFs haven’t filed their MFP2 form yet or I missed it)</p>

<p>You might remember that there is an $80 billion limit per counterparty for RRP. Each MMF has their own counterparty limit (which is why Fidelity as an investment manager is over $80B in RRP, they have 11 eligible counterparties)</p>
<p>How close are these funds to the $80B counterparty limits? Remember, this limit can be raised on a whim by FOMC. In fact, from June’s FOMC meeting minutes released yesterday, it states : “the manager noted that, at some point, it could become appropriate to consider raising the counterparty limits for the ON RRP.”</p>

<p>Here is the month-to-month change in some of the biggest RRP users</p>
<p>|Investment Manager|5/28 RRP|6/30 RRP|Diff|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Fidelity|195.0B|290.4B|+95.4B|
|BlackRock|42.3B|90.8B|+48.5B|
|JPMorgan|42.6B|74.5B|+31.9B|
|Morgan Stanley|44.1B|74.5B|+30.4B|
|Federated Hermes|9.5B|64.5B|+55.0B|</p>
<p>If you’re concerned about Fidelity being #1, check out the links below that explain why RRP usage is up. Very simplistic explanation: banks get lots of deposits through pandemic stimulus programs. SLR goes back into effect last March, banks need to hold less cash so they shift deposits to MMFs. MMFs hold short-term debt like T-Bills. Due to ongoing T-Bill shortage T-Bill rates are very low. Next best place to get T-bills is Federal Reserve. Large MMFs like Fidelity pile into RRP to minimize losses managing their large assets.</p>

<p>For MMFs, you can find the data by reading N-MFP2 forms (MMF portfolio holdings) filed monthly with the SEC. You can also find the data by looking at reports on the investment manager’s websites. Here’s the link I used to find which MMFs had repos with the Federal Reserve. (note: from the Federal Reserve’s perspective, it’s a reverse repo. From the MMF’s perspective it’s a repo.): <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=%2522Federal%2520Reserve%2522%2520OR%2520%2522FRBNY%2522&amp;dateRange=custom&amp;category=custom&amp;startdt=2021-06-30&amp;enddt=2021-07-12&amp;forms=N-MFP2">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=%2522Federal%2520Reserve%2522%2520OR%2520%2522FRBNY%2522&amp;dateRange=custom&amp;category=custom&amp;startdt=2021-06-30&amp;enddt=2021-07-12&amp;forms=N-MFP2</a></p>

<p>You can see a historical breakdown of RRP usage by MMFs here: <a href="https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-repos-with-the-federal-reserve/">https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-repos-with-the-federal-reserve/</a> (use the drill-down feature to see more granularity)</p>
<p>FOMC meeting minutes from last June, some discussion of RRP there: <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20210616.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20210616.htm</a></p>
<p>This quote serves as a good description: “With rates low and net Treasury bill supply contracting, government money market funds, which at the same time were attracting notable inflows, had limited investment options at nonnegative rates. As a result, ON RRP take-up by these funds surged, pushing total ON RRP participation to record levels in late May and June.”</p>

<p>Here's an interesting article about MMFs role in reverse repos and why it's happening: "US money market funds struggle as short-term rates near negative territory": <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0cff3e60-6591-493c-b85e-2d37d46f47a0">https://www.ft.com/content/0cff3e60-6591-493c-b85e-2d37d46f47a0</a> ( <a href="https://archive.is/EDvZb">https://archive.is/EDvZb</a> if you are pay-walled)</p>

<p>I noticed BlackRock updates their holdings everyday for the previous day, and you can see their daily RRP usage in their FedFund here: <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/products/282628/">https://www.blackrock.com/cash/en-us/products/282628/</a> (click "Holdings") On 5/28 it was 25.6B, 6/30 it was 39.5B, 7/7 it was 24.5B.</p>

If you open the Excel sheet you will observe on quarter end it's mostly utilized by Government-Sponsored Enterprises (10%-25%) and MMFs (75%-90%).</p>
<p>This dispatch from Zoltan Pozsar shows how large RRP usage can potentially grow by August 31st by exploring the capacity of the MMFs: <a href="https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7r6S02AN-VHSK">https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7r6S02AN-VHSK</a> “Thus, we’re looking at $1.3 trillion of flows from bills into RRPs by the end of August!”</p>

<p>It's possible I made an error in pulling some data or missed some N-MFP2 forms. Within the next two weeks, OFR will update their data here which will be more accurate if any discrepancies arise: <a href="https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-repos-with-the-federal-reserve/">https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-repos-with-the-federal-reserve/</a></p>
