There is no report, article or editorial that is going to get diamond hands to sell.\n\nThe mods of this sub are repeatedly successful in identifying and weeding out shill attacks - yes its not always pretty - but it works.\n\nThe news coming from GME and RC is noting but positive.  Assessing the fundamental potential of GME results in nothing but a positive outlook in short, medium and long term.  MOASS or no MOASS (there will be a MOASS) GME is such an excellent prospect.\n\nDropping the price is the only way they have to try and cause panic selling.\n\nIn addition, it now seems, more than ever, that the price IS important to the shorts.  They need it low or they get margin called.\n\nUntil holders of GME sell en masse every single minute of trading is a win for the longs and a loss for the shorts.  If the price drops the shorts do not stop loosing and the longs don't stop winning.\n\nSHF r fukt by Diamond Hands",
