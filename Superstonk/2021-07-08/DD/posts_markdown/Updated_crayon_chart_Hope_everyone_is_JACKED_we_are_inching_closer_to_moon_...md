Hey apes, hope the week has been going well. I know some apes like confirmation bias, so here are some updated pictures to keep you jacked! This is not financial advise and I put crayons in a blender and make crayon smoothies

[Here is the updated 1 day chart for GME. The TA I did a couple days ago still hold true and we are inching closer to the cup and handle break out. The downward descending channel we are in is the handle.  I'd imagine we continue this trend until it breaks out, don't be surprised if it dips to 159 range before the break out.  I don't think it will because there is an incredibly strong support at 180.  We might just bounce on the 180 until this this pops off.  Either way, I speculate we will be in this channel for a couple more days. I don't want to get you to jacked.... but it looks like 7\/14 could be the parabolic break out happens. hmmm... isn't that NFT day, a t + something day, along with 400k of deep OTM puts expiring](https://preview.redd.it/u8rdivob20a71.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=c04859d7231c21dec8f9f3cba67a6a2e8d6ca635)

&#x200B;

[Here is the 4 hour chart for GME.  The MACD is looking niceeee, I think it will start turning up soon. A cup and handle break out should test new highs.  I speculate that when this breaks out we will go parabolic and bounce of the 480 before going on our journey to the moon. ](https://preview.redd.it/kuzejy7g30a71.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7367c9992943622f7f8a1e98e124ac439344e32)

\*puts on tin foil hat\* I think that 7/14 shit pops of, we see the cup break out, along with a gamma squeeze, shooting us into the thousands, and starting the MOASS. Gamestop might just calling out the date, but in a way legal action can't take place \*takes tin foil hat off\*

&#x200B;

lets look at spy

&#x200B;

[this is the 1 day spy.  Again, the TA I did the other day is still holding true.  It looks like the ceiling was at 434 and spy is now going to start going down. It'll probably bounce off 426 and continue to go down.  MACD is indicating a downward move, PSAR is indicating downward movement as well.  Oddly enough, spy is lining up for a complete crash around 7\/14... well that just gets me ever more jacked](https://preview.redd.it/yc6j7gtg50a71.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b87c73e0f5f68805a6b9ceff224dda64f3b57943)

&#x200B;

Lastly lets look vix

&#x200B;

[This is the 4 hour vix. Remember what I said about volatile times coming up? look at that gap up lmayo.  I'd imagine the market gets more volatile going forward. the exciting thing is that it looks like some major action for 7\/14.](https://preview.redd.it/1lu9qppt60a71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb92a8763e48878fdaa5ec90e5bccfa7c5d77a9)

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** We are getting closer to moon launch! We are consolidating in the downward ascending channel (the handle of the cup) and looks primed for a break out any day.  Spy looks like it's going to start going down and VIX is showing volatile times coming up. A lot of indicators are point to some major action on 7/14. buckle up!

EDIT: on feb 1 2018, the NYSE made amendments that will require listed companies to notify the NYSE **at least 10 minutes** before a company announces any dividend or stock distribution or the fixing of a record date for any dividend or stock distribution, even if the announcement is made outside of market hours!

I just found that out via twitter!!! source is u/rensole buckle up apes!
