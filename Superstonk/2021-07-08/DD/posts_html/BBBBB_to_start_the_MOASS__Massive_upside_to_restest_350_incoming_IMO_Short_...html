<p><strong>TL;DR: 1D bounced off the bottom Bollinger band today which has resulted in an upside reversal 100% of the time since JAN 2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1W simultaneously bounced off of the middle Bollinger band today which has resulted in HUGE upside 100% of the time since JULY 2020.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1D and 1W bouncing off of their respective bands simultaneously like today has resulted in MASSIVE upside 100% of the time since AUG 2020 and has been what kicked off the 3 big sneezes this year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bottom Bollinger Band Banana Bounce</strong> <em>~~(bitch)~~</em></p>
<p>As you can see below, every time a 1D candle touches down on the bottom Bollinger band like a little ape filled moon-rover, there is a nice trend reversal to the upside. Also of note is that this Bollinger bounce historically happens simultaneously with a bounce off of the very strong RSI support level of 42.</p>

<p>What you may notice off the bat is that <strong>BOUNCE 1</strong> on 4/13 resulted in a limp (but still nice) reversal to a tame upside of <em>42.42%</em> ( Low of $132 to High of $188) while <strong>BOUNCE 2</strong> on 5/11 resulted in a strong reversal to an upside of <em>152.49%</em> (Low of 136.50 to High of 344.66).</p>
<p><strong>What does that mean for today’s BOUNCE 3?</strong></p>
<p>If we were to overlay the current downtrend we have been in since the 6/10 $350 test flash crash onto the very similar 3/15 $350 test flash crash you may hear the FUD whisper in your ear that we are surely going to repeat BOUNCE 1’s weaker reversal given that the charts line up BOUNCE 1 and BOUNCE 3 almost identically.</p>
<p>Well, direct your confirmation-fiending chimp eyeballs to the 1W chart below.</p>

<p><img alt="GME 1W Chart" src="https://preview.redd.it/icwkg3xa33a71.jpg?width=8000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6788ed066f3e6439c804dbf0e92719266cbe4b84" /></p>
<p>As you can see the 1W chart left the bottom Bollinger band on earth long ago, not to return until achieving contact with extraterrestrials. As opposed to the 1D bouncing off the bottom band, the 1W bounces off the middle Bollinger band before historically blasting into 4 weeks of beautiful atmosphere-testing upside until meeting the $350 <em>"resistance"</em> shown in red.</p>
<p>If you look at the 1D BOUNCE 1 that had a weaker upside you can see that it did not coincide with a simultaneous 1W BOUNCE indicating there was likely more downside to come before another joy ride in the moon-rover. However, 1D BOUNCE 2 lines up exactly with 1W BOUNCE 2 which resulted in 4 weeks of massive steady run up.</p>
<p>Even if your brain is polished smooth and shiny like a fucking marble I trust that you can see that today’s 1D BOUNCE 3 lines up exactly with the 1W BOUNCE 3 and what that may implicate.</p>
