<p>I am not in any way an expert on anything I am about to discuss here. I enjoy looking for patterns and shifting behaviors where others may not see them. In this particular instance, I thought I would look at the daily trade tapes (order books) of six stocks.  If a wrinkly brained ape ~~can~~ has a counter opinion to what I believe is happening, I would love to hear it. That's one major point of sharing data like this. My goal is to share with and possibly educate apes but also to be educated by those that may know more or interpret the data differently.</p>
<p>All stocks in this analysis other than GME have had their names changed because I honestly don't understand the rules about what can and can't be mentioned here. Stocks include <strong>GME, fruit, hamburger, adhesive, movie and bulldozer</strong>. Why did I pick those? I selected the fruit and movie stocks because they either are, or have been, grouped into the "meme" stock category. Call them whatever you want at this time, but let's just say "meme" is where they began. I also used a stock screener to find stocks which were similar to GME in both price and daily trade volume, resulting in hamburger, adhesive and bulldozer stocks.</p>
<p>Ok, now you know which stocks, let's talk about what exactly I am looking at here. While watching GME over the past months, I have become increasingly interested in all of the trades that fly by every second. They can go by so fast at times that you don't even have a moment to process the information. With that in mind, I started dumping the data out to a file so I could then review and chart it.  I had started looking at the 1 second after open and 2 seconds after close trades but over time I didn't feel like that was telling me anything. Thinking about it some more, I started looking at the <strong>sequence of trades</strong> and I noticed something interesting (to me at least). <strong>Many of the trades on the tape seemed to have a subsequent trade which immediately negated any price increase from the sale just before it</strong>. Don't worry, I HAVE LOTS OF PICTURES for you to look at. Hang with me.</p>
<p><em>So what do I mean by a trade has a subsequent trade negating the price increase?</em> I have seen many times where a trade will hit the tape with a <strong>$x</strong> <strong>gain</strong> vs the trade <strong>immediately before it</strong>. Ok, you say, that doesn't mean anything other than the trade price went up <strong>$X</strong>. You are a smart ape for thinking that. However, if you look closer, you will likely see another trade which follows immediately after the <strong>+$x</strong>, but it will be for <strong>-$x</strong>.  The <strong>$x</strong> gain on the 1st trade is immediately flipped to a <strong>-$x</strong> decrease on a subsequent trade. Putting real numbers to this example, let's say trade #200 on the day showed in increase of <strong>+$.02</strong> over trade #199, you very likely will see trade #201 come along and be <strong>-$.02</strong> when compared to trade #200, resulting in the "<strong>last trade</strong>" value dropping back down to the <strong>value of trade #199</strong>.  Making any sense yet? My head hurts, hope yours doesn't. Oh yeah, one other thing. <strong>The negating trade value doesn't always happen in just one trade</strong>. Sometimes it's two trades added together which creates the total necessary to negate the <strong>$x</strong> increase.  I PROMISE I HAVE PRETTY PICTURES!!</p>
<p>Why are we talking about this again? Good question. Everyone here knows that the market is manipulated by those that apes love to hate, that's no surprise. What I was surprised by is how often a positive movement is immediately negated by a negative movement. I was also surprised by how clear the <strong>price bands</strong> are for some of the stocks, the fruit one in particular. More on price bands later.</p>
<p><strong>ENOUGH JIBBER JABBER APE, GET TO THE PICS!!</strong></p>
<p>Ok, ok. You got it.</p>
<p>The first images will show you plots of daily trade tape data, with each point being the % increase or decrease compared to the trade <strong>immediately preceding</strong> it. <strong>WAIT!</strong> I know, I was talking in dollars earlier and now I am talking in percentages. I used percentages because it was easier for you all to see how each stock behaves while keeping them on a manageable scale. <strong>This does not change the fact that the trades occur as I outlined above</strong>. It just makes for a bit of a tighter view of the issue. Now to the pics...</p>

<p><em>I have 2 more days of this but I don't want to overload the main body of the post with more images of the same. I can share them in comments.</em></p>
<p><strong>THAT'S A LOT OF DOTS!!</strong> Sure is. That's because a lot of trades take place every single day. Some of these stocks generate more trades (not volume, total trades) than GME so I capped all of them at the first 40,000 trades of the day.  Every green dot shows a trade that had an <strong>increase in price</strong> vs the trade <strong>immediately before it.</strong> Each red dot shows a trade which had a <strong>decrease in price</strong> vs the trade <strong>immediately before it.</strong> The turquoise dots show trades which had a price identical to the trade before it.</p>
<p>First of all, the spread on GLG is SO much bigger than the other 5 stocks included here. I am not here to discuss the spread, but maybe that could be for another day. What I want you to notice is how <strong>many of the green dots have a mirror image dot in red</strong> which appears immediately after the green one.   You can see this in all of the plots above.</p>
<p>How about we zoom in and <strong>take a closer look at a subset of trades for GME</strong> and also look at the <strong>trade tape data</strong> which goes along with it? Here is a section of trades for GME (note the values on the x axis. Those indicate all trades between the <strong>22500th and 22700th</strong> trade of that particular day.</p>

<p>Here you start to get a better look at the <strong>mirror trades</strong> I have been talking about. It's important to note that <strong>not all trades</strong> follow this mirror pattern but there are <strong>MANY</strong> which do. Also keep in mind that some of the negative sides of the mirror <strong>use 2 trades</strong> to make up for the <strong>1 trade</strong> on the positive side. In those cases, it won't be as obvious just by looking at the dots.</p>
<p>Here are examples of the trade tape data which is represented in the scatter plot above.  You will notice that <strong>not every example I provide shows an exact mirror</strong>. I am including those because I don't claim this to be an infallible review of the data but also to show that <strong>I think algorithms attempt to negate trades but sometimes get it a bit wrong</strong> due to the speed at which trades are being processed.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zqz6mjjmw3a71.jpg?width=1004&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7328d108db39b7efd679b5b44ad392156c328c76">Trade tape data</a></p>
<p>This is a tiny fraction of the daily trade volume and within this small subset, you can already see how many <strong>mirror trades</strong> appear to be taking place. I have looked at the trade tapes of other days and this pattern is present in every single one. Is this the natural flow of things or is this more evidence of <strong>algorithmic manipulation</strong> of stock prices? My hunch is the latter. You can decide for yourself. Oh, but maybe you need a bit more data to chew on.</p>
<p>Do you recall that I mentioned <strong>price bands</strong> earlier in this post before I showed you all the nice pics? Let's get back to that before I wrap things up. These next images are what helped increase my confidence that I was seeing algorithmic manipulation vs some kind of natural stock market balancing based on supply and demand. Here are zoomed in version of the <strong>fruit and bulldozer</strong> stocks over 4 trading days.</p>

<p>How do you like them apples? Now, one last thing to consider before I let my ape brain rest for a bit. Both the fruit and bulldozer stocks show price change bands but I'm pretty sure you apes can see just how much <strong>more defined the bands are for the fruit stock vs the bulldozer</strong>. Also note that the bulldozer ones are not nearly as consistent as the fruit ones are. There is some consistency there, but nearly the same as the fruit.</p>
<p>In the end what does this tell us? Well, it doesn't help the price go up, that's for sure. It also doesn't predict anything in terms of price movement unless you are the trading sideways guy, then you are loving every bit of this. What this tells me is that <strong>there is not much apes can do to make the MOASS happen</strong> other than sitting tight and holding on. Yeah, I know you all know that, but I like to show it with data. <strong>Something big needs to give</strong> because it's painfully clear that amongst the thousand and thousands of trades happening every day, these <strong>mirror trades</strong> are keeping us sliding sideways for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR -</strong> There are thousands of what I ~~am~~ call <strong>mirror trades</strong> happening every day which keep the price sliding sideways and MOASS is waiting for a big event which is completely outside of retail's control.  Not much that you didn't already know, but more data to hopefully pull the curtain back just a little bit more.</p>

<p>In the next image, I wasn't intending to zoom in on movie stock this much but I'm glad I did it accidentally. Look how the mirror trade bands shift perfectly in sync with one another, particularly around the .020% range. At first I thought I was an idiot and just mirrored the data sets but if you look at the other scatter points, you can see that they don't all follow a mirror trade pattern. But those positive and negative bands... holy cow are they the spitting image of each other.</p>
