    "selftext": "Ryan Cohen posted this tweet saying he loved it!!!!\n\nLets dive right in shall we?\n\n[https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1413223954387406851?s=20](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1413223954387406851?s=20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohs3o5zqs1a71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1766cd1517688e6b42edb7b7dc5c20aaa7ee1718\n\nSo clicking the link and taking a look at the first/cover photo we can see clearly its a GameStop store on the moon and an ape on the outside of it.... think about it GAMESTOP with an APE on the MOON... Im le jaqued!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GameStop and ape on the moon](https://preview.redd.it/1grr5qgss1a71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3081d2803ff4da7efcb2ed1c6944778f7b232961)\n\nNow is where things get REAL interesting........ Looking at the second photo it appears to be the backside of the building. In this photo you can see a man drawing the GME chart with a green marker!!!! and it appears to be in an apeish pattern aka a SQUEEZE only going up. It looks like GME may be getting another leg up before the infinity squeeze and GME goes parabolic. Now the lego man is a very familiar face..... ill let you decide what logo they are basing it off of. There is also an ape looking at the drawing. Look at the exit sign.... crossed out (NO EXIT STRATEGY). This is class A confirmation bias to me...\n\nIF THIS DOESN'T JACK YOUR TITS I DONT KNOW WHAT WILL!!!!!!!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[all the confirmation bias I need](https://preview.redd.it/xfzhjsyts1a71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=310148497232f4df127de7ebd5231e8d2a3eb854)\n\nThe other 2 photos I haven't found any great shakes but if you see something leave it in the comments!!!!!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y6k3obws1a71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df9598a4279aa0c15542f99e368806492c021242\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jxff8zkxs1a71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aa70fbf22a33d8ed4870a3d265644d475ba3845\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm leaving you all off with this last message....
