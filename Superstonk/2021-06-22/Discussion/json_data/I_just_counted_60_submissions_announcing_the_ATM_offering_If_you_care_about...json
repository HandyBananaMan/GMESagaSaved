I know some of it it just excitement but let\u2019s use some common sense - there are likely apes that are scanning news constantly looking to get info posted ASAP, and that\u2019s great, and of course there will be some overlap.  \n\nBut the repeat posts 30 minutes later are just karma whoring, and we don\u2019t need that in this sub, we\u2019re here for the greater good. Relax, for big news like this all of us saw it, and someone probably has already posted. Just take a quick look first, that\u2019s all.\n\nEdit: typo",
