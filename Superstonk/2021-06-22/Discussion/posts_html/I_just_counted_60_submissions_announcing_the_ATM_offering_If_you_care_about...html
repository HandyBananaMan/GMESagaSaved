<p>Come on guys, some of these posts were 20 minutes after the first one I saw, and there have probably been another 10 since I wrote this. I know some of it it just excitement but let’s use some common sense - there are likely apes that are scanning news constantly looking to get info posted ASAP, and that’s great, and of course there will be some overlap.  </p>
<p>But the repeat posts 30 minutes later are just karma whoring, and we don’t need that in this sub, we’re here for the greater good. Relax, for big news like this all of us saw it, and someone probably has already posted. Just take a quick look first, that’s all.</p>
