<p>Is it not illegal for paid shills to post online in an effort to affect the price? It's illegal stock bashing right? </p>
<p>It's not enough to simply identify them and shut down their ability to post. They should be prosecuted. Is there some way to refer these people for prosecution and is there some investigation currently happening? Are there any wrinkly-brained lawyers out there who know how these people could be prosecuted?</p>
<p>I know there can be a reverse class action in some cases but I don't think this has been done for stock bashing.  </p>
<p>But in 2019 there was this: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-216">SEC Charges 18 Traders in $31 Million Stock Manipulation Scheme</a></p>
<p>This needs to happen some more!</p>
