<p>As far as i recall from Wes Christian GameStop should now have enough to actively sue, as the price manipulation directly lead to them getting less money from the ATM offering.</p>
<p>Although that's surely gonna take a while, it could be another nail in Citadel's coffin. If the price is suppressed by conservative 50% the damage from the ATM would be 1.2bln alone.</p>
<p>Change my mind.</p>
