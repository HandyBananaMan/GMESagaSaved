Shills will be out in full force and the FUD will be strong.\n\n1. Check the front page under \u201ctop\u201d - if the news is there then go read the comments and link that page to general discussion etc.\n\n2. If it\u2019s not there, check \u201cRising\u201d and repeat point 1.\n\n3. If you have new news, then post it and copy the link into general discussion to summon wrinkled apes to have a look. \n\nTo reiterate - the MSM are not to be trusted, even if it\u2019s good news for us. Don\u2019t pick and choose when we listen to them, never trust anything from them. \n\nApes strong together, but dumb apes succomb to MSM narrative.\n\n**edit**\n\nFor all the pedantic apes out there, if it comes from GameStop itself, what do you think? \ud83d\ude48",
