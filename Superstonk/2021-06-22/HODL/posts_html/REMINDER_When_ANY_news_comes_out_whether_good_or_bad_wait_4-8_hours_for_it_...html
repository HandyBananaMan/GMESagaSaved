<p>Just a reminder to all to not hype on good news, not panic on bad news, until wrinkled apes have gone over it with a fine tooth comb.</p>
<p>As we enter unchartered territory this week and next (another T+21 cycle, Russell 1000 potential, June 30th mortgage shit) there will be A LOT of fake news, click baits and the MSM going overboard to try and sway opinion. Shills will be out in full force and the FUD will be strong.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check the front page under “top” - if the news is there then go read the comments and link that page to general discussion etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it’s not there, check “Rising” and repeat point 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have new news, then post it and copy the link into general discussion to summon wrinkled apes to have a look. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To reiterate - the MSM are not to be trusted, even if it’s good news for us. Don’t pick and choose when we listen to them, never trust anything from them. </p>
<p>Apes strong together, but dumb apes succomb to MSM narrative.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong></p>
<p>For all the pedantic apes out there, if it comes from GameStop itself, what do you think? 🙈</p>
