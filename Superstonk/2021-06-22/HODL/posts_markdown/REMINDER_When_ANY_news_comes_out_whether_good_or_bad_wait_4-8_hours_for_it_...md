Just a reminder to all to not hype on good news, not panic on bad news, until wrinkled apes have gone over it with a fine tooth comb.

As we enter unchartered territory this week and next (another T+21 cycle, Russell 1000 potential, June 30th mortgage shit) there will be A LOT of fake news, click baits and the MSM going overboard to try and sway opinion. Shills will be out in full force and the FUD will be strong.

1. Check the front page under “top” - if the news is there then go read the comments and link that page to general discussion etc.

2. If it’s not there, check “Rising” and repeat point 1.

3. If you have new news, then post it and copy the link into general discussion to summon wrinkled apes to have a look. 

To reiterate - the MSM are not to be trusted, even if it’s good news for us. Don’t pick and choose when we listen to them, never trust anything from them. 

Apes strong together, but dumb apes succomb to MSM narrative.

**edit**

For all the pedantic apes out there, if it comes from GameStop itself, what do you think? 🙈
