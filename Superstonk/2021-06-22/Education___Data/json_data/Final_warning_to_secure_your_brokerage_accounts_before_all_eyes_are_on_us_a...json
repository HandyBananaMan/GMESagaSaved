You don\u2019t wanna be caught with your pants down and scramble to get things setup durning MOASS. \n\n- Get an encrypted email, and link it to your brokerages/ bank accounts. I use/ recommend Proton mail. \n\n- Turn on 2 factor authentication for brokerage/ bank accounts. \n\n- Change passwords to 16+ digits, using random combinations of letters, caps, numbers, and special characters.\n\n- Get/ turn on a VPN when browsing Reddit or clicking links for extra security. \n\n- GET THE FUCK OFF ROBINHOOD IF YOUR STILL THERE!!\n\n- Make sure margin is turned off in your brokerage accounts, and shares held in cash. \n\nHonestly, that\u2019s all I really have but believe it could be significantly important, especially when talking about receiving potentially xx-xxx+ millions, in a time when most people will be suffering financially.   Don\u2019t push it off.  Imagine your MOASS gains are on the line now.  \n\nLastly, this isn\u2019t to scare anyone, more of a \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d situation.  If anyone has more suggestions, please post in comments as this is not a field I\u2019m very knowledgeable in. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
