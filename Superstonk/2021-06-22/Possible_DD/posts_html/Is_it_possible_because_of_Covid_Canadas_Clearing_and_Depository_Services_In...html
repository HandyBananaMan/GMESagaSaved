<p>Salutations r/Superstonk neighborhood Jellyfish here, hope everyone has had a great day! I was diving into the DTCC's Latest Important Notices and came across this:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/dy263wxxyv671.png?width=987&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30fdf76629c485fa00ade872d28f2ae014e8dad">It looks like Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (CDS) is setting up an account for Bank of Nova Scotia for tomorrow, we keep seeing that happen... </a></p>
<p>Anywho, Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (CDS) had me scratching my head since I haven't heard of them in our saga to this point.</p>
<p>Heading to the trusty Internet (and successfully avoiding PornHub), I came (hehe) across the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/4ea60y5pzv671.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f9d8c3ebdc69a9d2cb771fa7af23f368c337d9a">Gah, get to the point Jellyfish! </a></p>
<p>Right, so digging along their page further I come across these rules that are in place for Covid:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ydavc9rxzv671.png?width=1232&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00bb798cf392ff1eaf542cbfa446b31edb59ec6a">Hmm, closed to physically accept US deposits and withdrawals still? Let's try and take a look at this notice </a></p>
<p>Ok, this is where I would like to rant a little and give a 'little credit' to DTCC. Thumbing through the CDS  site, it was going to cost $1,200 to find this damn bulletin! I am probably not rubbing my three brain cells together properly after my afternoon snack of magenta crayons, but at least this stuff is free and easy to find on the DTCC...</p>
<p>Ok, back on topic, and I think I found a version of the rule Interneting extra hard (pretty sure the link was actually in the comments section of a video on PornHub, but I digress...):</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hi9t2v1k0w671.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9da2962eb57187a21562cddfa5e1d3e836612ffc">2020-0024C: A PDF copy can be accepted?!?!? Can anyone else find CDS bulletin # 2020-00033C?</a></p>
<p>So if I am reading the bulletin correctly and that it is a version of the rule we are looking for but older (This is a big assumption mind you), because of Covid and the CDS window still remaining closed, at their discretion, they will allow for a PDF copy of the transaction to suffice.</p>
<p>Errr, is this a system set up ready to be abused? <a href="https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/tech/tech-pulse/pdf-substitution-scam-targets-finance-departments">PDF substitution scams</a> target AP departments all the time, is it that big of a leap to think it wouldn't be dialed up to 11 at this level?</p>
<p>Furthermore, wasn't <img alt="Paul Manafort" src="https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-manafort-bank-fraud-pdf-word-document-2018-2" /> caught in part because he didn't know how to use Word and Adobe 'properly' to cover his tracks when trying to submit fraudulent documents?</p>
<p>TL:DR - I believe there is a chance because of Covid, Canada's Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (CDS) current rules of accepting pdf's can be abused to facilitate FTD's for US securities.</p>
