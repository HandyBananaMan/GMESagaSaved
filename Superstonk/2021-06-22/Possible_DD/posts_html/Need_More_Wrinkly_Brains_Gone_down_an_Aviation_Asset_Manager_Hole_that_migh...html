<h1>tl;dr:</h1>
<p>This might be nothing.....but I found some weird shit that I need help with. Think there may be other companies swept under the rug. I'm looking to close and can't see what's under my nose.</p>
<p>So I posted earlier breaking down some behaviorism shizzz as it related to the market.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Well u/cashmeresquid2309 and u/itsunclejerry <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o5rl2l/behaviorism_girl_here_lets_talk_about_this_shiz/h2obvmr/?context=3">mentioned</a> there having been a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mou8ww/ken_griffin_exposed/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">thread  about Ken G.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After going to the thread I noticed  something interesting talking about how he owned a 2012 and 2001 bombardier. I thought this sounded interestingly familiar. Then I realized....Oh duh, it's familiar because I saw these make and same models when I was looking at Cessna's on <a href="https://Controller.com">Controller.com</a>. There are quite a few of the same make and models that he has.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I started digging around</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/yfweyhh9av671.png?width=1897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5344649637b8c880567788a120b6360b94e2be6c">Uno</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/h3jfvdrnav671.png?width=2014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2772231a1fa128e121615a28e46c7388c19631">dos</a></p>
<p>Quite a few of the same...could be coincedental.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After digging through some of the sellers I saw this one...there's also some in London but they don't have interesting ties.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/60iy13c3bv671.png?width=1803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d4fd45fda8073bb719bfb6bc2617a8e031b816e">New Jersey is close to NYC...and Citadel</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Still speculation yeah.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>SO I looked up Leading Edge Aviation Solutions. I started going through their <a href="https://leas.com/team/">team members.</a> And they're all quite incestuous with other aviation companies. I can't find exactly where it is or remember precisely what it was...but something made me look at DuckDuckGo with keywords "ken griffin aviation company."</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://flcompanydb.com/company/L06000067245/griffin-aviation-llc.html">Griffin Aviation.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There also is a <a href="https://www.griffingam.com/about">Griffin Asset Managemen</a>t (interesting <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005957/en/Griffin-Global-Asset-Management-Closes-1-Billion-Warehouse-Facility">article</a>out of Dublin and LA which works closely with aviation. I find this interesting as Griffin Aviation has been dead and inactive and this is an asset company that does alot within the aviation world. Interestingly another <a href="https://newsroom.aviator.aero/griffin-global-asset-management-closes-1-billion-warehouse-facility/">Griffin Asset Management </a>company closed on a warehouse deal on April 23rd, 2021</p>
<pre><code>DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Griffin Global Asset Management DAC and Griffin Global Asset Management (Servicer) LLC (together, “Griffin”) announced today that on April 23, 2021 Palisade Aviation Holdings Warehouse, Ltd. and Palisade Aviation Holdings Warehouse, LLC (together, the “Borrowers”), closed a five-year senior secured warehouse facility with an initial committed amount of $1,000,000,0000 (the “Facility”). The Borrowers were jointly established by Griffin and funds managed by Bain Capital Credit, L.P. as part of a joint venture focused on building a diversified aviation portfolio in conjunction with a world-class commercial aviation leasing and alternative asset management platform.

The Facility includes innovations that provide the Borrowers with maximum flexibility to offer its airline partners a variety of financing solutions, ranging from operating leases to finance leases to direct loans across a diverse spectrum of asset types and ages. The Facility is also unique in providing more flexibility on concentrations of certain airline exposure than a traditional warehouse facility, providing the joint venture with a powerful bridging tool to long-term capital markets solutions.

“We are grateful for the support from our banks as we grow the Griffin platform into a leader in the aircraft leasing and financing sector. This warehouse facility has significant capacity and flexibility that will allow us to create customized capital solutions for our airline customers going forward,” said Ryan McKenna, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Griffin.

“Developing this warehouse facility was a collaborative process with our lending partners and resulted in a first-of-its-kind facility in the aviation industry. The overwhelming support from these seven financial institutions is very meaningful as the growth of Griffin accelerates. Going forward, we will continue to create innovative financial products that will meet the evolving needs of the airlines and OEMs in this dynamic market,” said John Beekman, Chief Financial Officer of Griffin.

Goldman Sachs acted as the structuring agent for the Facility. Initial commitments for the facility were provided by Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank PLC, Mizuho Americas, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch.

Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed LLP acted as U.S. legal advisors to Griffin and the Borrowers, Milbank LLP acted as legal advisors to the Lenders, Maples and Calder (Ireland) LLP acted as Irish legal advisors for the Borrowers, Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP acted as Cayman Islands legal advisors for the Borrowers, A&amp;L Goodbody LLP acted as Irish legal advisors to Griffin and PWC acted as Irish tax advisors for Griffin and the Borrowers. UMB Bank, N.A. is acting as the administrative agent and the security trustee.
