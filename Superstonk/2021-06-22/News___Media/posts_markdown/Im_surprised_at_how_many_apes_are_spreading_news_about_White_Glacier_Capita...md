I feel like this was what everyone was warned about. The media is going to suggest HFS are going bankrupt etc etc.
I have no trust in what MSM says anymore.


Don’t believe the media.

If you want to post anything about a HF going bankrupt, actually fact check it first and make sure it’s even relevant….

The report suggests they suffered losses from the initial squeeze in January, as if they covered.

Smells like FUD.

It isn’t MOASS until it is MOASS.
