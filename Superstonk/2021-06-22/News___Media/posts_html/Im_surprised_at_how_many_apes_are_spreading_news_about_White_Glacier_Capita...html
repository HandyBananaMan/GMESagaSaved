<p>I feel like this was what everyone was warned about. The media is going to suggest HFS are going bankrupt etc etc.
I have no trust in what MSM says anymore.</p>
<p>Don’t believe the media.</p>
<p>If you want to post anything about a HF going bankrupt, actually fact check it first and make sure it’s even relevant….</p>
<p>The report suggests they suffered losses from the initial squeeze in January, as if they covered.</p>
<p>Smells like FUD.</p>
<p>It isn’t MOASS until it is MOASS.</p>
