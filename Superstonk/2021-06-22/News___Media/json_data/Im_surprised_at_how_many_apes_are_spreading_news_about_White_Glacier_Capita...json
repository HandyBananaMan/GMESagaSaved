The media is going to suggest HFS are going bankrupt etc etc.\nI have no trust in what MSM says anymore.\n\n\nDon\u2019t believe the media.\n\nIf you want to post anything about a HF going bankrupt, actually fact check it first and make sure it\u2019s even relevant\u2026.\n\nThe report suggests they suffered losses from the initial squeeze in January, as if they covered.\n\nSmells like FUD.\n\nIt isn\u2019t MOASS until it is MOASS.",
