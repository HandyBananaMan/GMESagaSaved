    "title": "My 14 y/o has invested 43% of $35 he earned this mo. in his new Fidelity Youth account. Impressive by itself, but it tickles me that he watches the price and slowly buys each dip. Picked himself up $5 worth yesterday. I'm so proud for him, & wanted to share with apes who can appreciate it. \ud83e\udd73",
