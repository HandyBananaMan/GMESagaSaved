If you\u2019re with Rakuten and bought shares before 4/15 then call them and bring this up when speaking to them. I\u2019ll try again tomorrow and use this knowledge ThaStonk shared with me. You can be mad at Rakuten as a company but don\u2019t be rude over the phone when speaking with the staff. Hope this helps y\u2019all Samurai Apes!!\n\n\nEdit5# I will read Rakuten Securites user terms and agreement in a few hours to see if share lending/margin is mentioned. Japanese friend and I will proof read and update once more. Stay strong (update Rakuten does not lend shares by default, you have to register for that, and for margin account)\n\nEdit4# Take this update with a grain of salt, doesn\u2019t mean your shares are on margin but this does seems fishy to me, IGNORE anyone telling you to transfer/sell. I just want to bring light to this:\n\n[DEBUNKED, choosing any topic on the chat option changes chat HTML to /margin\n\nSorry but I\u2019m wrong on this one, seeing the html change to /margin gave me ptsd and made me jump to conclusions. I\u2019ve come to dislike that word too much for my own health.\n\nI went to chat with their customer service here:\n\nhttps://www.rakuten-sec.co.jp/web/help/chat/\n\nWhen you choose to chat about [\u7c73\u56fd\u682a\u5f0f] (US Stocks) the HTML link changes to:\n\nhttps://www.rakuten-sec.co.jp/web/help/chat/margin\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nRakuten Securities won\u2019t let us apes vote because according to them they use Interactive Brokers as their US custodian and the shares are under Rakuten and not under our names! \n\nTHIS IS JUST AN EXCUSE! \n\nTiger Brokers who use Interactive Brokers as their US custodian under Tiger Brokers name let apes vote because of high demand for voting! IF THEY WORK THE SAME AS RAKUTEN THEN RAKUTEN HAS NO EXCUSE! THEY ARE LAZY AND INCOMPETENT!\n\nLet\u2019s get \u697d\u5929\u8a3c\u5238\u7121\u80fd (Rakuten Securities incompetent) trending on Twitter!!!\n\nAnyone who is Japanese or international, knows Japanese or even just google translate is enough!!! We need to push them to let us VOTE! \n\nPlease, this is a cry for help. Most Japanese GME holders don\u2019t know about the DD so there has not been a big movement yet. I\u2019m trying my best to inform people around me but there\u2019s not much I can do alone.\n\nI have so much love and respect for all you Apes!\n\nEdit3# comment by u/HalleysComet41\n\nI would recommend adding the hashtag #\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u4e8b\u4ef6 or gamestop incident, as that is what it is commonly referred to. (By commonly, I mean common among the very very small percent of the population who is active in investing / investing news / or watches Horiemon)\n\n\nEdit1# RAKUTENS TWITTER HANDLE IS @RakutenSec\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rakutensec\n\nEdit2# what you can write to @RakutenSec:\nupdate by u/WowSuchinternetz :\n\nYour Japanese translation is garbage.

Tiger brokers works thr same as Rakuten. Rakuten has no excuses when it works for Tiger Brokers! Rakuten is lazy and incompetent.",
