    "selftext": "Good lord people....if DFV is back on Twitter.....it means he is confident enough, or his lawyers are, that he can interact with the public again.\n\nHoly shit everyone think about it.  DFV might have stopped posting (on his own accord or at direction) because he couldnt risk being targeted as a manipulator and \u201ccausing\u201d the margin call/MOASS........\n\nDFV posting now might mean the margin call has has happened, this is pure speculation to be fair. He can\u2019t inadvertently cause something with a post if it\u2019s already happened.\n\nHoly. Shit.\n\nHOLDDDDDDDDD.\n\nEdit: wrinkle ape below mentioned it could be as simple as a lawsuit being resolved or dropped that was keeping him quiet.  Still exciting having that giant balled Diamond Handed Ape back!\n\nEdit2: wording for clarity.\n\nEdit 3: last edit before bed.  I suppose my post could read that DFV has some insider info.  I\u2019m not suggesting he does.  I am suggesting that the dude smart enough to have foreseen ALL OF THIS to perhaps be smarter than the average Ape. The price that this house of cards crumbles....I bet DFV knows the price tag.",
