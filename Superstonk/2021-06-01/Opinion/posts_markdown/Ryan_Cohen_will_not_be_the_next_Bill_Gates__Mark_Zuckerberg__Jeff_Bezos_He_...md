The world's richest man that actually gives a damn about us.

Is there a list of charities that Ryan supports somewhere that we may eventually spread the love after MOASS? (all money goes in to GME before MOASS) It would be a great way to show our appreciation to the man that will not only help us all become wealthy, but also saving a store that so many of us have fond memories of. ğŸš€ğŸš€
