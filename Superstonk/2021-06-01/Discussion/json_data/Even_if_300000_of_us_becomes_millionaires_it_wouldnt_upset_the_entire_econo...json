Despite a population of only 8 million, there were 277,000 millionaires living in Singapore in 2020. \n\nSuperstonk is 300k, worldwide, out of 7 billion. \n\nShut up about \u201cif everyone becomes rich then no one is rich\u201d. Statistically it\u2019s easier for all of Superstonk to be literally on the moon than for all 7 billion people be rich. \n\n\nTLDR; \nIgnore FUD about guilt tripping you for being rich.",
