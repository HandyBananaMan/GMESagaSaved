Not one post can be found in Hot or Top posts for the past 24hrs. \n\nIN FACT, if you look at the top posts there are three highly voted posts with 14k, 8k and 3k. Then a precipitous drop into the hundreds and then double digits. \n\nConversely Super Stonk has pages and pages of DFV posts. And at least 50 posts with 2k+ upvotes. \n\nWSB is dead!\n\nEdit: spelling",
