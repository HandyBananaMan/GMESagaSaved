It shouldn't be terribly difficult to set up (based on my experience) an IFTTT statement combined with Automod functions to instantly slap up a sticky with their latest tweet. This will significantly reduce clutter in \"New\" and reduce karma farming substantially. Mods, any chance we can make this happen?\n\nEdit: I very much like the additional suggestions of fellow apes to combat the 2 sticky post limit Reddit has in place. Having the Stonkbot post them to a God Tier Tweet flair would be sufficient to keep them organized and the upvotes will do as much as a sticky ever could.",
