<p>With such amazing news and gains today I was curious to see what the degenerates on WSB thought of the DFV tweets. </p>
<p>NOTHING!!! Not one post can be found in Hot or Top posts for the past 24hrs. </p>
<p>IN FACT, if you look at the top posts there are three highly voted posts with 14k, 8k and 3k. Then a precipitous drop into the hundreds and then double digits. </p>
<p>Conversely Super Stonk has pages and pages of DFV posts. And at least 50 posts with 2k+ upvotes. </p>
<p>WSB is dead!</p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p>
