<p>Update <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqucfo/ape_scrapbook_draft_proposalidea_outline_and/">here</a> !</p>
<p>I got my hardcopy GME Proxy Statement and 2020 Annual Report in the mail yesterday and was over joyed to have a little souvenir to remember the most spectacular event of my life by and made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/npfwzc/go_this_in_the_mail_today_as_a_pleasant_surprise/">this</a> post about how rad it would be to get you all to sign it like a high school yearbook.</p>
<p>Then I got to thinking, what if we actually had one? Not to be published and sold for profit, it would be just for us.</p>

<p>I work in graphic design, book design, copy/content writing, was in YearBook club in high school, and have been working my own little MOASS scrapbook as we go and think I could really make us something beautiful we could all keep as a MOASSbook.</p>
<p>I'll make it, take input of what should be included, have it printed +mailed, and we could use it as a way to make a large donation to do some good in the world from all of us.</p>
<p>I was thinking we could add our most important memes, DD, timeline, awesome AMA guests (if they're willing), MOASS art (if artists would like to licence it for the book), and other things as suggested by Apes in our community...and then have pages where Apes could sign their username in the front and back covers like an actual yearbook!! We could maybe do a cover art vote like for our phenomenal banner too. I'd it now and it would be released following the MOASS so that's included too of course!</p>
<p>Would you apes be interested in that? What do ya'll think? ðŸ“š</p>
<p>I am happy to verify identity and indicate that I am not a crook through the mods :) Sales would be done legally on a platform Apes will be able to trust.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>/u/bobmahalo suggested creating an NFT and using that for charity $$$$ which I think is BRILLIANT and will make that happen!!!</p>
<p>EDIT 2:</p>
<p>Looks like there's demand. I'll start making a plan/outline, do some DD and be in touch soon for input for major things to include in it :)</p>
<p>EDIT 3:</p>
<p>I also want to clarify it wouldn't be a mass published book, more so just a fun and beautiful scrapbook for our community and our journey together. Just a memento :) Profit and personal gain is not the intended outcome and if i can pull this off as anonymously as possible, I'd love that.</p>
<p>I am not the "author", the community is and I would just compile it in a rad way.</p>
