With such amazing news and gains today I was curious to see what the degenerates on WSB thought of the DFV tweets. 

NOTHING!!! Not one post can be found in Hot or Top posts for the past 24hrs. 

IN FACT, if you look at the top posts there are three highly voted posts with 14k, 8k and 3k. Then a precipitous drop into the hundreds and then double digits. 

Conversely Super Stonk has pages and pages of DFV posts. And at least 50 posts with 2k+ upvotes. 

WSB is dead!
