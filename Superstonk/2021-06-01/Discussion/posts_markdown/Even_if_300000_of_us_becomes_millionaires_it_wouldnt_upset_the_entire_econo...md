To put into perspective, let’s look at Singapore. Despite a population of only 8 million, there were 277,000 millionaires living in Singapore in 2020. 

Superstonk is 300k, worldwide, out of 7 billion. 

Shut up about “if everyone becomes rich then no one is rich”. Statistically it’s easier for all of Superstonk to be literally on the moon than for all 7 billion people be rich. 


TLDR; 
Ignore FUD about guilt tripping you for being rich.
