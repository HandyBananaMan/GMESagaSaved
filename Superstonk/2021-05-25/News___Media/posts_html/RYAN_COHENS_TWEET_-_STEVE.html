<p>Hahahahaha! I can’t stop laughing! 😂😂👏</p>
<p>Ryan Cohen is the meme lord (move over Elon!)</p>
<p>So his last tweet got me thinking about a post I happened by yesterday on another sub in Reddit. It referred to a weather phenomenon called S.T.E.V.E.</p>
<p>In the tweet, the character Steve was being pushed upwards, yes? Now, read this from a science type person...</p>
<p>“STEVE, short for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement, is a sky glow that appears south of the northern lights (SN: 3/15/18). STEVE’s main feature is a mauve band of light formed by a stream of plasma flowing westward through the atmosphere — a different phenomenon from the one that gives rise to auroras (SN: 4/30/19). But STEVE’s purple arc is often accompanied by a “picket fence” of vertical green stripes. That fence looks similar enough to the shimmering green curtains seen in the aurora borealis that scientists thought at least this part of STEVE could be a type of aurora.”</p>
<p>A PICKET FENCE OF VERTICAL  GREEN  STRIPES IN THE SKY!!!!!!</p>
<p>Like a financial chart, some might say. </p>
<p>Needless to say I am jacked.</p>
<p>RC. YOU ROCK DUDE!</p>
