I can\u2019t stop laughing! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4f\n\nRyan Cohen is the meme lord (move over Elon!)\n\nSo his last tweet got me thinking about a post I happened by yesterday on another sub in Reddit. It referred to a weather phenomenon called S.T.E.V.E.\n\nIn the tweet, the character Steve was being pushed upwards, yes? Now, read this from a science type person...\n\n\u201cSTEVE, short for Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement, is a sky glow that appears south of the northern lights (SN: 3/15/18). STEVE\u2019s main feature is a mauve band of light formed by a stream of plasma flowing westward through the atmosphere \u2014 a different phenomenon from the one that gives rise to auroras (SN: 4/30/19). But STEVE\u2019s purple arc is often accompanied by a \u201cpicket fence\u201d of vertical green stripes. That fence looks similar enough to the shimmering green curtains seen in the aurora borealis that scientists thought at least this part of STEVE could be a type of aurora.\u201d\n\nA PICKET FENCE OF VERTICAL  GREEN  STRIPES IN THE SKY!!!!!!\n\nLike a financial chart, some might say. \n\nNeedless to say I am jacked.\n\nRC. YOU ROCK DUDE!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nEdit - spelling.",
