<p>Like Hype Videos? I know I do. That's why I spent hours scrolling through r/Superstonk, r/GME, and r/wallstreetbets to put this list together. This was originally posted on Friday evening at like 11pm, but then I realized most Apes aren't going to be on then after watching the stonk all week. I have roughly 70 in this collection so far, but if I missed your favorite, let me know... they kinda start blending together after 40 videos or so. We have some incredibly talented Apes and Apettes in this group and I can't wait to change the world with you retards ü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç</p>

<p>*I do not claim to have had a hand in creating any of these videos. Even the worst ones are better than anything I could throw together. I did my best to link to the original post for each video. If I made any mistakes, please know that I don't care because this shit took me goddamn forever as it is. If I missed your favorite, please do let me know about that and I'll make sure to add it to the list. I did try to keep the list to the posts that had at least a little effort or creativity involved. For example, there are a ton of videos of move scenes or songs posted where the poster just has alternate lines as subtitles. Just doesn't do it for my tits.</p>
