I recommmend to call once you have send it back to ensure they see it on time and froward it on time.  Please feel free to share. \nHere is one link to another ape\"s post about it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkixm4/finally_got_my_vote/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n\nEdit: some apes wrote it might be possible to vote even a bit longer. Anyway don't waste time and do it as soon as possible.\n\nEdit 2: sorry I don't know how it works at other brokers. I would just give them a call and ask.\n\nEdit 3: no kidding: my sibling just voted and told me that the guy at comdirect said they are getting a lot of feedback. So I don't know if the one I talked to had no clue or if apes are coming in now last minute. In any case: great job!!!  See you all on the moon! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\n\nThis is no financial advise",
