So automod (the bane of my existence) decided to delete my comment that did some digging into the Gamestop ERC 721 Smart Contract. I'm reposting the info here for anyone curious.

*All ethereum addresses posted here can be looked up on* [*etherscan.io*](https://etherscan.io) *(as I'm too afraid automod will delete my post if I add in links).*

# Smart Contract

The smart contract itself is your standard erc-721 contract. The **launch date is set for July 14th,** but note that this is a *soft launch* date as the contract has explicit code that can change that date.  The official address is found here **0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e**

Fun fact as pointed out by u/joshmo23 \- the first 7 digits of the smart contract address are indeed shout outs to gamers and are likely not a coincidence in this case. 1337 being a reference to "leetspeak" and "420" being pretty obvious. Vanity public addresses are definitely possible in the Ethereum world, but are harder to calculate the more specific your address is. Perhaps there's more to be found in the address!

# Multisig Wallet

There is a gnosis safe multi-sig wallet found at **0x10B16eEDe03cF73CbF44e4BFFFa3e6BFf36F1Fad .** which is also the owner of the GameStop NFT smart contract. Multi-sig wallets require a set number of participants to agree on a transaction before following through with that transaction. This allows for delegated ownership of everything from smart contracts (deployed via the multi-sig) to transferring ether.

# ENS

For those unfamiliar, ENS is just a namespacing service analogous to DNS. It connects the name, **gamestopnft.eth** to the address **0x10B16eEDe03cF73CbF44e4BFFFa3e6BFf36F1Fad** which is GameStops multi-sig wallet. 

# My Personal Opinion

NFTs for GameStop?! Fuck yeah! It shows me that GameStop is a growing tech company and not the "brick and mortar" company that the media likes to portray it as. GameStop is putting itself front and center into a rapidly growing cryptospace with potential to pull in large sums of revenue via digitized assets. Remember, it costs GameStop almost nothing (only Ethereum gas fees) to sell some NFTs, so it's a pure profit play. The sky is the limit here, and there are a million things they could do via NFTs, from cross platform integrations to possible dividend awards for sharehodlers. The NFT space is amazing, and the initiative this company has taken to enter this growing space shows me the technical prowess this company has to redefine themselves. 

TL;DR

TITS Jacked. GameStop entering the NFT space. Nothing out of the ordinary when it comes to their smart contact. It may be worth following addresses posted above over the next few days to see if we can get any more information. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸ¦§ðŸ¦§ðŸ¦§

Edit: Had to edit the post of bad information that was present due to a misunderstanding of what I thought was a "proxy" contract. Upon further inspection, it's actually a Gnosis Safe multi-sig. I apologize for the misinformation!
