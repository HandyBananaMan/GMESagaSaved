#Title: ðŸ“¢I am disappointed: I just talked to my German broker comdirect. He said many requested the vote material but only very few handed it in. ðŸ˜¥ It's easy! I did it in 5 minutes. 6 crosses one signature and your customer number, sent back via e-mail! See link/post. #apes_do_your_job don't be lazy!

If you don't have the Proxy material just call comdirect. They are alway available via phone. I think it can be done until tomorrow night. I recommmend to call once you have send it back to ensure they see it on time and froward it on time.  Please feel free to share. 
Here is one link to another ape"s post about it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkixm4/finally_got_my_vote/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


Edit: some apes wrote it might be possible to vote even a bit longer. Anyway don't waste time and do it as soon as possible.

Edit 2: sorry I don't know how it works at other brokers. I would just give them a call and ask.

Edit 3: no kidding: my sibling just voted and told me that the guy at comdirect said they are getting a lot of feedback. So I don't know if the one I talked to had no clue or if apes are coming in now last minute. In any case: great job!!!  See you all on the moon! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸŒ™
