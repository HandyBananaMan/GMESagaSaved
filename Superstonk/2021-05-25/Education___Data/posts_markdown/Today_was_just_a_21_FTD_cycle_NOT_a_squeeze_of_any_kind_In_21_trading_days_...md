THIS WAS NOT A SQUEEZE OR GAMMA SQUEEZE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

This was the simple T+21 FTD cycle repeating itself, again. Only higher. Seriously, look up the last +21 cycle day, April 26th. We also had a green dildo that day.

Next T+21, June 23rd, is going to be even more insane.

Now, imagine when they actually have to COVER all the shares they counterfeited and shorted, again and again... today's gains will be nothing in comparison. 

It's just a matter of who holds longer. Apes or billionaire hedge funds.


EDIT: next T+ 21 might be June 24th because there is a holiday in between.
