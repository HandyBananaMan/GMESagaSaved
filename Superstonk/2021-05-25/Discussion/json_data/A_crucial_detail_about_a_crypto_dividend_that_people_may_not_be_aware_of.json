    "selftext": "One of the big issues that has kneecapped previous launch attempts: massive numbers of new short sales.\n\nA proprietary crypto dividend wouldn't just force existing shorts to cover their positions before the date of record for the dividend, it would also **prevent any new shorts from entering the market before that same date**.\n\nDepending on when things are announced, there may literally not even be enough time to short the stock & then close the position such that the trade is *settled* on time. Can't FTD or they're screwed. Can't create fakes. Can't even buy the crypto from a public marketplace because literally nobody has it until after the delivery deadline.\n\n*That* is the real power move here, because it screws over every short seller with open positions & it keeps any *potential* short sales from taking profits that would have otherwise gone to a shareholder.\n\nThis is the coolest freaking thing ever.",
