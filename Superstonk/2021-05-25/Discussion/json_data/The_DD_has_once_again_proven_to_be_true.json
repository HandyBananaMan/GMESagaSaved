    "selftext": "Well Apes, ~~here we are at T+35 and the day after T+21.~~\n\nEdit: \" Here we are at T+21 and the day after T-35\" My brain is so smooth! :)\n\nNo news was released and the GME price is up over ~~13%~~ ~~15%~~ 17% at the time of this writing. When does a stock jump that fast and high with NO NEWS? It doesn't.\n\nTime and again the King Kong Apes with their Wrinkle Brain DD are proven right every time. I am really just happy to be here with my people. Really looking forward to the Annual Ape Meeting fast approaching. Power to the players! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a\ud83e\udd8d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThanks for awards Apes but please save them for your GME or at the least, to the original DD creators: u/Criand,  [u/homedepothank69](https://www.reddit.com/u/homedepothank69/) and all the other amazing DD's that came before!",
