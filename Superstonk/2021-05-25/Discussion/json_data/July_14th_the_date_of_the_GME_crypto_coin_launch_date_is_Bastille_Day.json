    "selftext": "The July 14th date is so amazing. \n\nEdit: Here is where you can verify the release date of the [GME Token](https://imgur.com/gallery/XoOHBEn) Credit to u/teacoat___\n\nMy wife pointed out that\u2019s Bastille Day.   \n\nThat\u2019s the day where the French citizens\u2014who were insanely oppressed by the monarch\u2014rose up, stormed the Bastille, and overthrew the ruling 1%.   \n\nLearn more about this important date: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day\n\nThat launch date is not accidental. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, Bastille is a synonym for citadel. Wonder who\u2019s going to be storming the Citadel this time...\n\nI didn\u2019t think my tits could be even more jacked. See you on the moon fam \ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 2: semantically I should have said \u201ctoken\u201d instead of \u201ccoin\u201d in the title",
