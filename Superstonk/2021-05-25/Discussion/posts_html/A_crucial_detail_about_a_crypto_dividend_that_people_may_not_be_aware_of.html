<p>One of the big issues that has kneecapped previous launch attempts: massive numbers of new short sales.</p>
<p>A proprietary crypto dividend wouldn't just force existing shorts to cover their positions before the date of record for the dividend, it would also <strong>prevent any new shorts from entering the market before that same date</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on when things are announced, there may literally not even be enough time to short the stock &amp; then close the position such that the trade is <em>settled</em> on time. Can't FTD or they're screwed. Can't create fakes. Can't even buy the crypto from a public marketplace because literally nobody has it until after the delivery deadline.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is the real power move here, because it screws over every short seller with open positions &amp; it keeps any <em>potential</em> short sales from taking profits that would have otherwise gone to a shareholder.</p>
<p>This is the coolest freaking thing ever.</p>
