<p>The July 14th date is so amazing. </p>
<p>Edit: Here is where you can verify the release date of the <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/XoOHBEn">GME Token</a> Credit to u/teacoat___</p>
<p>My wife pointed out that’s Bastille Day.   </p>
<p>That’s the day where the French citizens—who were insanely oppressed by the monarch—rose up, stormed the Bastille, and overthrew the ruling 1%.   </p>

<p>That launch date is not accidental. </p>
<p>What’s more, Bastille is a synonym for citadel. Wonder who’s going to be storming the Citadel this time...</p>
<p>I didn’t think my tits could be even more jacked. See you on the moon fam 🚀</p>
<p>Edit 2: semantically I should have said “token” instead of “coin” in the title</p>
