The July 14th date is so amazing. 

Edit: Here is where you can verify the release date of the [GME Token](https://imgur.com/gallery/XoOHBEn) Credit to u/teacoat___

My wife pointed out that’s Bastille Day.   

That’s the day where the French citizens—who were insanely oppressed by the monarch—rose up, stormed the Bastille, and overthrew the ruling 1%.

That launch date is not accidental. 

What’s more, Bastille is a synonym for citadel. Wonder who’s going to be storming the Citadel this time...

I didn’t think my tits could be even more jacked. See you on the moon fam 🚀

Edit 2: semantically I should have said “token” instead of “coin” in the title
