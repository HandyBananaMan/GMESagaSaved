Then we can have video game tournaments at AMC establishments, or GameStop arcades in AMC theatres? \n\nReally I\u2019m just so happy to be apart of this movement with you all, and we want to see you succeed just as much as we want to succeed. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s so early in the morning and my coffee hasn\u2019t kicked in yet.\n\nSincerely,\n\n-An ape who loves movies and video games\n\nEdit* \nNot a movement, I am not a financial advisor, and some of you are incredibly hostile lol.",
