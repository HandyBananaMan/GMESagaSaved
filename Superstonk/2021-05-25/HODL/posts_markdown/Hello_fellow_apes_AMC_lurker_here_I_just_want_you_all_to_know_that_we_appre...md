There really isn’t anything else that needs to be said. Get your gaming tendies and we will get the movie tendies. Then we can have video game tournaments at AMC establishments, or GameStop arcades in AMC theatres? 

Really I’m just so happy to be apart of this movement with you all, and we want to see you succeed just as much as we want to succeed. 

Also, it’s so early in the morning and my coffee hasn’t kicked in yet.

Sincerely,

-An ape who loves movies and video games

Edit* 
Not a movement, I am not a financial advisor, and some of you are incredibly hostile lol.
