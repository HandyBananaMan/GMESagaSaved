No TLDR. I would like you to read this.

I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise. Many of you apes are saying you plan to hold for numerous reasons; some apes want to be a philanthropist, while others for their loved ones. Those reasons will help strengthen your resolve. The real resolve to become diamond hand is to use common sense.

I need every retarded ape to drill in their brain basic math. TSLA had a short of 20%, a larger float than GME, a bunch of paper hand folks who didn't even know about the SI or believe in the damn stock, and it went to 4.5k (Combine 5:1 split) a share.

GME has a short of 140% (That's the highest number it can be reported as. It's probably 777%+), a smaller float, and diamond handed folks. So even if you're a paper hand f\*\*k, common sense dictate that you hold to at least 31.5k. That's basic math. Any number less than that, like 5k or 10k mathematically makes no sense. I did not even factor in the finra short change rule f\*\*kery, how much lower the share amount GME has, or that institutions already own the float. **That's how ridiculously generous 31.5k a share is you retarded apes.** And because many of you are retarded, no, institutions can not on a whim sell all their shares. I don't know how I can make this more clear for you retards to understand. 

And to assist with your resolve, back in late February, Finra changed how they reported short interest calculation. They no longer report short interest but short % of the float. What calculation are they using for the float? Are synthetic shares included in the float? They refused to let us know. That's how large the damn short is...

So hopefully I established basic sense into you. When and **BY THE TIME** it gets to 31.5k, **STAYS** at an uptrend price, and 5 days **HAVE PASSED**, even the largest liquidity short hedge funds would have been margin called, and **that's when the price stop mattering**. Since at that point, the short hedge funds no longer determine when they buy and the brokerage/clearing house takes over and buys at market price. If the damn clearing house goes bankrupt, then you wait until the DTCC takes over. It may take the DTCC a month before they take over, but they'll pay up. And finally, if the DTCC goes kaput, then you wait for the FED to print our damn money. That's why the floor is 20 million. 

I need you to understand each hedge funds short position amount is different and each short hedge funds liquidity is different from one another. SHF get margin called at different price range.
