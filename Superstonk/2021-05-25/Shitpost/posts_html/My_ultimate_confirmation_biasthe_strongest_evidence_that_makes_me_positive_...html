<p>For those of you who are unaware, the New York Mets are basically baseball's version of Murphy's Law. Literally anything that can go wrong for them, will indeed go wrong.</p>
<p>After having arguably the worst owners in baseball for decades, the Mets were bought last year by Steve Cohen (yes, <em>that</em> Steve Cohen). Currently, he stands as the richest owner in baseball. The belief was that with the New York market and this now incredible amount of money, the Mets would finally be able to put together a team that would regularly challenge for the World Series.</p>
<p>The absolute most Mets thing of all-time would be if a bunch of redditors bankrupted their new owner and completely fucked over the franchise.</p>
<p>That is why I'm absolutely positive this will indeed happen.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr = Buy puts on the Mets</p>
