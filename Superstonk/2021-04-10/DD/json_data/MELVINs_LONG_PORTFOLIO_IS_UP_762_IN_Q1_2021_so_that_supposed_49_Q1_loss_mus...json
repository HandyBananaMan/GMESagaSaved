    "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\n**by now we have all seen the headlines, Melvin Capital supposedly closes Q1 with a 49% loss:**\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.reuters.com\\/article\\/us-hedgefunds-melvin\\/hedge-fund-melvin-capital-lost-49-on-its-investments-in-q1-source-idUSKBN2BW2Q2](https://preview.redd.it/304nnxp9wcs61.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf024551c923a5ecc09c1fd791eddda6de59f141)\n\nOf course, whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but I have just spent half an hour inputting stock price changes into Melvin's portfolio, and **if it's true, IT'S REAL BAD.**\n\nApart from being **a fraudulent short seller**, Mr. Melvin is actually a pretty shrewd investor.\n\nFor the period ending 31 DEC, he reported to the SEC a **Portfolio Value of $22,639,690,000** across 77 positions, opening 5 new ones, and closing 36 positions. Mister Melvin sold a lot of profitable calls and stock at the start of this and previous quarter (at first glance), so it's also likely he is sitting on a sizeable cash reserve. But that's not the crux of this analysis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In this report for 31 DEC 2020, Mr. Melvin reports holding $19,787,325,000 LONG in the following stocks:**\n\n[Great bet on AVIS, Mr Melvin! I will spend it wisely.](https://preview.redd.it/k3ivey8eycs61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f641d0b31a6afba510065f5e57600b096173bb1)\n\n[ANF sure turned out to be a shrewd pick, huh?! Good going Gabe!](https://preview.redd.it/0pqvpsziycs61.png?width=1123&format=png&auto=webp&s=efba96023dcaafff067207e128d9759501c7265b)\n\n[Gabe with the X-ray vision on XRAY!](https://preview.redd.it/mzsz0malycs61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a57cfc9d23543dee4148f392668cf3db32b936)\n\n# Let's zoom the total in: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iyw4euqycs61.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdcff6d18644d798a6960648ee8a8a6361ec3ea1\n\n# Mr. Plotkin posted a 7.62%, or $1.507bn profit in his LONG holdings between the 31 DEC report, and 31 March 2021! \n\n# Well done Mr. Plotkin! Thank you for making sure you have enough liquidity to pay any liabilities that may come up in the future!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**49% of Mr. Plotkin's LONG portfolio would be:**\n\n# $10,434,209,633!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA $10.43bn loss, guys!\n\n**A $10.43bn loss, so far, Gabe.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------\n\n**Find more long-read DDs in my profile, I now research and write about GME full-time thanks to the kindness of the apes!**",
