Hey guys,

**by now we have all seen the headlines, Melvin Capital supposedly closes Q1 with a 49% loss:**

[https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-hedgefunds-melvin\/hedge-fund-melvin-capital-lost-49-on-its-investments-in-q1-source-idUSKBN2BW2Q2](https://preview.redd.it/304nnxp9wcs61.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf024551c923a5ecc09c1fd791eddda6de59f141)

Of course, whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but I have just spent half an hour inputting stock price changes into Melvin's portfolio, and **if it's true, IT'S REAL BAD.**

Apart from being **a fraudulent short seller**, Mr. Melvin is actually a pretty shrewd investor.

For the period ending 31 DEC, he reported to the SEC a **Portfolio Value of $22,639,690,000** across 77 positions, opening 5 new ones, and closing 36 positions. Mister Melvin sold a lot of profitable calls and stock at the start of this and previous quarter (at first glance), so it's also likely he is sitting on a sizeable cash reserve. But that's not the crux of this analysis.

**In this report for 31 DEC 2020, Mr. Melvin reports holding $19,787,325,000 LONG in the following stocks:**

[Great bet on AVIS, Mr Melvin! I will spend it wisely.](https://preview.redd.it/k3ivey8eycs61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f641d0b31a6afba510065f5e57600b096173bb1)

# Mr. Plotkin posted a 7.62%, or $1.507bn profit in his LONG holdings between the 31 DEC report, and 31 March 2021! 

# Well done Mr. Plotkin! Thank you for making sure you have enough liquidity to pay any liabilities that may come up in the future!

&#x200B;

**49% of Mr. Plotkin's LONG portfolio would be:**

# $10,434,209,633!

&#x200B;

A $10.43bn loss, guys!

**A $10.43bn loss, so far, Gabe.**
