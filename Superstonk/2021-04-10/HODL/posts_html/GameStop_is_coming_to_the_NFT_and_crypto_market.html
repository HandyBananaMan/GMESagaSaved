<p><strong>In an otherwise typical job posting from April 8th, 2021</strong>, GameStop inadvertently expressed interest in the booming non-fungible tokens market, alongside blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Analyst, Security is responsible for monitoring and maintaining data and platform confidentiality, integrity and availability in an enterprise environment.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listed under Additional Skills and Experience, GameStop asks that applicants have experience in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blockchain, cryptocurrency, or non-fungible tokens</strong></li>
<li><strong>Machine learning or artificial intelligence</strong></li>
<li>eCommerce</li>
<li>Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)</li>
<li><strong>eSports or competitive gaming</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What could GameStop be building?</p>
<p>Any sort of NFT announcements, or even rumors, now result in massive catalysts for public companies. It is likely that Ryan Cohen knows this, and is possibly looking into the roles GameStop could play in this emerging industry.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, stock market analyst and acclaimed author <strong>Tony Oz</strong> <strong>published a video</strong> detailing what effect he believes a GameStop NFT announcement would have on the stock price. This is pure speculation, so take it with a grain of salt, but investors may deem it worth a watch.</p>

<p><strong>*EDIT 2:</strong> Thanks for the Gold, anonymous redditor which I strongly believe can be our dear kitty or chairman king</p>
<p><strong>*EDIT 3:</strong> Notice how shills attack in downvoting my comments. Dont fall for it.<br />
 This news doesnt mean that Gamestop will go all-in on crypto of course, but it definitely might be an indicator of what can be their path.</p>
