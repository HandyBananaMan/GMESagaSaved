It is likely that Ryan Cohen knows this, and is possibly looking into the roles GameStop could play in this emerging industry.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, stock market analyst and acclaimed author **Tony Oz** **published a video** detailing what effect he believes a GameStop NFT announcement would have on the stock price. This is pure speculation, so take it with a grain of salt, but investors may deem it worth a watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*EDIT:** Position - [https://careers.gamestop.com/job/analyst-security/J3V0R174DZHKP9C5FVQ](https://careers.gamestop.com/job/analyst-security/J3V0R174DZHKP9C5FVQ)\n\n**\\*EDIT 2:** Thanks for the Gold, anonymous redditor which I strongly believe can be our dear kitty or chairman king\n\n**\\*EDIT 3:** Notice how shills attack in downvoting my comments. Dont fall for it.  \n This news doesnt mean that Gamestop will go all-in on crypto of course, but it definitely might be an indicator of what can be their path.",
