Hi Apes,

I found an irregularity to the news regarding the loss of Melvin.

Now it is important that you use your own head. I'm just pointing out what I noticed.

I would also like that you correct me at any time if I'm wrong. This is the most important part of this whole sub!

&#x200B;

This is all mere speculation and please again point out ANY flaws you can find!

I assume that the news were planted.

A really good write up on why was already posted by u/JustBeingPuny in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo038k/04102021_the_fud_news_on_melvin_stop_believing/) post.

I want to add, that something on the upvotes is really off.

Notice how both posts have a lot more upvotes than the rest?

[43.1k hmm thats strange....](https://preview.redd.it/rdjpvsjt3es61.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9d8a10263aafb200c700a1a4a934fdbe48ef77b)

Okay just compare this to our beloved news of u/rensole.

&#x200B;

[Around 10k upvotes on each](https://preview.redd.it/ah8cpdde4es61.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=213be3e8e76501ced83e62eb8bc5a905541e62d5)

Now let's take a look at u/atobitt

Notice here how the Everything short has 31k. However this was posted on GME and it was an important write up.

&#x200B;

Now let's take a look at u/WardenElite

&#x200B;

[Around 6 to 10k upvotes](https://preview.redd.it/wva57rbo6es61.png?width=1597&format=png&auto=webp&s=33a9c7082d42d7f61369ff6dbe6437bf1671ae6f)

Now I am not calling out the users who posted the screenshots as shills because they might as well could have been just celebrating apes.

However letting posts of reposts of some dumb internet article rise that fast is quite critical. There were no fact checks and there were no sources. Just those screenshots. I even saw some more of them. So please think about this with your cortex and not your amygdala!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My opinion:

I think it was planted and the hedgefunds might have found our Achilles heel of us.

Celebrating and pushing *'seemingly good'* news on our beloved ape sub. Getting a lot of upvotes fast!

Now this can be used in two things.

Either pushing a narrative on us that is not the truth which will hurt us in the long run as they already did in the past.

Or testing a way on how to diverge us from our lovely tendies.

Now how exactly could this happen. Even when we do not do dates, there is seemingly a lot of hype for next week. This seems to me like they are trying a fake squeeze. I haven't followed up the exact margin calls but hopefully a more wrinkly brain could give them to me maybe? I can add them here as soon as possible.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Closing words:

Apes we need to grow wrinkles fast! Think if something is wrong. Always think what kind of narrative they could pinpoint on us!

Again correct me if I am mistaken!!!

Apes cheers together!

EDIT: I'm an ape I can't spell or write! (Spelling and Grammar)

EDIT2: Stop giving me awards I just looked at upvotes nothing special. Give it to the real heros!

EDIT3: Some apes have pointed out that news like that short and simple are just easier to digest, so rising up more easily. This might as well be the case just wanted to point it out!

EDIT4: Alot of arguments against a fake squeeze is that institutions would be margin called along the way. This might be true. Can some wrinkle also write a DD about this?

EDIT5: I want to express my Achilles heel argument a little more. *puts on tinfoil hat* If they can push such things and we dance to it then we are still their puppets. Then they can say Oh look they danced to it see this needs to be shut down. And the article that reddit says more to go is the best example of it. Simply some here commented that. And then suddenly we are being generalised into those few of us. If this was successful once it can be done again.

EDIT6: Even the one who posted the Screenshot commented here and found it quite strange!!!
