Well, according to previous quarterly-filing in 10-Qs to the SEC, the 2023 "10-year" Bonds Gamestop took out restricted the company from doing a number of things that are vital to reshaping Gamestop into an e-commerse business, and stops potential catalysts for a squeeze.

[Here's a direct quote from Q2 2020 10-Q filing :](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18221/)
