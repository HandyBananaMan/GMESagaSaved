<p>As most apes already know <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-voluntary-early-redemption-senior-notes-0">today Gamestop announced they are paying off there 2023 corperate bonds nearly two years early.</a> Now why would they want to do that when all that liquidity could be put towards reshaping the company?</p>
<p>Well, according to previous quarterly-filing in 10-Qs to the SEC, the 2023 "10-year" Bonds Gamestop took out restricted the company from doing a number of things that are vital to reshaping Gamestop into an e-commerse business, and stops potential catalysts for a squeeze.</p>
