Why should we invest in stock market that is completely manipulated when I can buy non counterfeit token that has been created through an open source community? I think that what's happening with GME will speed up the transition to crypto! 

Change my mind

HODLING to change this shit!


Edit: I'm happy to see a lot of people had the same though...i was thinking that a solution could be a stock exchange based on the Blockchain! I think that it will be the future and japan wants to be the first!!

Edit2: I don't want people to sell GME for crypo (what we are doing here will be taught at university and remembered)...I wanted just to show some of my though on why the US government (or any other government even european), by not doing anything, is worsening more the situation.
People will relay more on blockchain than the government after GME!
