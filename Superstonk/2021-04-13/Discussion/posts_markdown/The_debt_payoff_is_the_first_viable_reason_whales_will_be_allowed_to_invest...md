Plus the SEC just got a new daddy

The volume and OBV was weird as fuck during the drop, not matching any other stock.

It looks like the last downtrend was entirely shorted as it had little to no volume.

And then we've got the share recall from Vanguard, who may oh I don't know "see value in the fact they've paid off all their debt" and invest further in the company because they like the stock.

I wish I was paid already, this is going back up regardless of manipulation at this point, and if any of the shorts that just got dumped in from 200+ are broken past, we might see a slingshot.

Jacked to the tits. If it doesn't rise, I'll buy more.
