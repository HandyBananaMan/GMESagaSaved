<p>Plus the SEC just got a new daddy</p>
<p>The volume and OBV was weird as fuck during the drop, not matching any other stock.</p>
<p>It looks like the last downtrend was entirely shorted as it had little to no volume.</p>
<p>And then we've got the share recall from Vanguard, who may oh I don't know "see value in the fact they've paid off all their debt" and invest further in the company because they like the stock.</p>
<p>I wish I was paid already, this is going back up regardless of manipulation at this point, and if any of the shorts that just got dumped in from 200+ are broken past, we might see a slingshot.</p>
<p>Jacked to the tits. If it doesn't rise, I'll buy more.</p>
