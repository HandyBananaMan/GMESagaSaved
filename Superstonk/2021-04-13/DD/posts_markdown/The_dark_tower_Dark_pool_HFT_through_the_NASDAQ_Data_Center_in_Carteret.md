Dear fellow apes,

Did I just eat too many crayons or did I find something fishy? Please help me!

Oh and please forgive me, I am not native to english just native to crayons, data and tendies.

So this morning I tried to look for daily short volumes and stumbled upon [FINRA´s data page](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily). 

Thinking "yummy, data, data" I downloaded all the data I could find about GME und was wondering why the heck there were three volumes for each day:

&#x200B;

1. NYSE Volume
2. NASDAQ Chicago Volume
3. NASDAQ Carteret (south of NYC) Volume

Alright, so I plotted all of them in my old fucking Spreadsheet. Do you see what I saw?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok, a whole lot of data, I know. Let´s zoom in to the last days:

WTF?? **Looks like the price decline in the last days seems to correlate with more trades through the NASDAQ Data Center in Carteret, NJ**. (For you mathematicians out there, correlation coefficient is -0.6, so pretty hight).

So I google what is going on in Carteret and at first only find that they are pissed of by a possible transaction tax. Alright, why again? Further googling and my mind goes Boom!

I try to do a summary but **please, smarter ape brains, you can do a lot better in trying to find out what this all means for GME, Dark Pools and HFT fuckery.**

It seems like the Data Center in Carteret is heavily involved in 

* High Frequency Trading
* **Uses his short physical distance to the NYSE for a time advantage of some nano seconds to capture incoming orders to manipulate buyings and sellings**

In the last days, many much smarter apes than me found out about Dark Pools induced price manipulation. 

***Speculation:*** **It might have to do with this data center in Carteret. We need to find out more about it i think. Is Citadel involved?**

[One slideshow of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute seems to explain how that could work.](https://intelligence.org/files/csrbai/wellman-slides.pdf)

**The second interesting fact that I recognized was an enlarged short percentage via the infamous NASDAQ Data Center in Chicago (Hello Kenny, is that you???)**

**So yes, fuckery seems to go on. I personally hold onto the stock like my wifes boyfriend to her sweet body....**

TL;DA: ***Something fishy going on in NASDAQ Carteret Data Center.*** [Read this fucking article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-is-relativity%3A-what-physics-has-to-say-about-market-infrastructure-2020-04-09)***.***
