<p>Dear fellow apes,</p>
<p>Did I just eat too many crayons or did I find something fishy? Please help me!</p>
<p>Oh and please forgive me, I am not native to english just native to crayons, data and tendies.</p>
<p>So this morning I tried to look for daily short volumes and stumbled upon <a href="https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily">FINRA´s data page</a>. </p>
<p>Thinking "yummy, data, data" I downloaded all the data I could find about GME und was wondering why the heck there were three volumes for each day:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>NYSE Volume</li>
<li>NASDAQ Chicago Volume</li>
<li>NASDAQ Carteret (south of NYC) Volume</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, so I plotted all of them in my old fucking Spreadsheet. Do you see what I saw?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ok, a whole lot of data, I know. Let´s zoom in to the last days:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>WTF?? <strong>Looks like the price decline in the last days seems to correlate with more trades through the NASDAQ Data Center in Carteret, NJ</strong>. (For you mathematicians out there, correlation coefficient is -0.6, so pretty hight).</p>
<p>So I google what is going on in Carteret and at first only find that they are pissed of by a possible transaction tax. Alright, why again? Further googling and my mind goes Boom!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-is-relativity%3A-what-physics-has-to-say-about-market-infrastructure-2020-04-09">This article nearly fucking my apely brain.</a></p>
<p>I try to do a summary but <strong>please, smarter ape brains, you can do a lot better in trying to find out what this all means for GME, Dark Pools and HFT fuckery.</strong></p>
<p>It seems like the Data Center in Carteret is heavily involved in </p>
<ul>
<li>High Frequency Trading</li>
<li><strong>Uses his short physical distance to the NYSE for a time advantage of some nano seconds to capture incoming orders to manipulate buyings and sellings</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the last days, many much smarter apes than me found out about Dark Pools induced price manipulation. </p>
<p><strong><em>Speculation:</em></strong> <strong>It might have to do with this data center in Carteret. We need to find out more about it i think. Is Citadel involved?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://intelligence.org/files/csrbai/wellman-slides.pdf">One slideshow of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute seems to explain how that could work.</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The second interesting fact that I recognized was an enlarged short percentage via the infamous NASDAQ Data Center in Chicago (Hello Kenny, is that you???)</strong></p>
<p><strong>So yes, fuckery seems to go on. I personally hold onto the stock like my wifes boyfriend to her sweet body....</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DA: <strong><em>Something fishy going on in NASDAQ Carteret Data Center.</em></strong> <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-is-relativity%3A-what-physics-has-to-say-about-market-infrastructure-2020-04-09">Read this fucking article</a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
