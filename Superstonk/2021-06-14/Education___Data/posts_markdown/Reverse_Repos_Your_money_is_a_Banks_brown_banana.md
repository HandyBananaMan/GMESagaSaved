I tried to post this as a reply to someone looking to understand Reverse Repos better and I ended up going over the word limit.  I wrote it because while there are resources elsewhere about what Repos are, I really couldn't find a good DD/Education post here about what they are; only what they are doing.  
  
I'm a smooth-brain that used to swear that money was incomprehensible.  While the GME Saga has changed that, I still eat crayons and snort bananas.  What I'm writing here may not be entirely correct, but I hope the essence is on track for others who want to understand.  This is my first attempt at contributing to the community's wrinkle portfolio, so feedback is appreciated.  
  
This is not even close to financial advice.  
  
---  
  
Before we get to Repos, we first need to understand that dollar bill in your pocket and what it means when you deposit it in the bank. When you hold onto that dollar bill, it's an asset. It's a good thing as it lets you get stuff. But when you put it in a bank, you aren't just stuffing it into a giant wallet.  
  
Side note, this is where banks have kind of mind-fucked you.  
  
You are not putting your money into a big vault to be kept safely. You are LOANING it to the bank to use to make more money. They just don't want you to realize that because we'd want more than 0.00000025% interest for the use of our money. Keep that in mind, you are loaning money to the bank when you "deposit" it.  
  
**EDIT02:** A clarification on how your money turns into something banks don't want to have on their books.  Thanks to /u/hrcen for asking for a clearer example.
  
>You have $100. You see it as a good thing, and it is because it's yours.  
>  
>You put the $100 in the bank. The bank now owes you $100. You can drop by and take that $100 back at any time. So to a bank's viewpoint, that $100 can go POOF at any time. They aren't allowed to count your $100 as a good thing because they can't depend on it being there if they need it.  
  
...  
  
Now to Repurchase Agreements (a.k.a. Repos). A Repo is when Bank A sells an asset to the Federal Reserve Bank (the Fed) in exchange for cash, under the AGREEMENT that Bank A can buy it back (repurchase) at a later date.  Usually the price it's bought back at is different leading to either the Bank or Fed pocketing the extra, depending on which way the cash needs to flow.  
  
A Reverse Repo is just the bank and Fed swapping places. So the bank buys an asset from the Fed to sell back later.  
  
The RRPs (Reverse Repos) that you see being discussed have a couple notable aspects that you should keep in mind. First, they are 0% interest. So the Fed buys the asset back for the same amount, meaning no profit for anyone. Second, the buyback date is the very next day, so the money only sits at the Fed for 24 hours.  
  
**Repo:** I sell X to you, I buy it back from you later.  
**Reverse Repo:** I buy X from you, I sell it back to you later.  
  
 ... 
  
Why are Reverse Repos a big deal right now?  
  
Remember our discussion about that money in your pocket? When you loan it to the bank, it's no longer an asset. It becomes a liability to the bank because at any time you can walk into a bank and take that dollar back. While banks can use your money to make more money, they can't use it to justify any loans or risky investments they have long term.  
  
(This is ignoring the innate nature of all US dollars: It's pure debt. But that's a whole other slew of DDs.)  
  
Last year, COVID hit and the economy closed down. To keep everything from falling apart (like a House of Cards.....) the Fed began to push a lot of money into the economy as a form of financial CPR. This is both good and bad. The reasons why would be another whole slew of DDs. But the end result is that now, over a year later, there is a SHIT-TON of extra cash floating around.  
  
Where does extra cash end up? **In banks.**  
Remember what cash deposited into a bank becomes? **Liability.**  
  
The banks are absolutely flooded with liabilities now. This is a problem because every day their books are checked to see just how much in liabilities they hold compared to their assets. It's essentially a daily margin call.  
  
So what is a bank to do? Well, the Fed is letting banks move lots of this cash to them in exchange for an equal amount of assets *just long enough* to pass this test for 1 day. Cool, but that cash comes right back 24 hours later. The bank has to do this over and over or face a world of shit.  
  
As you can guess, this is just kicking the can down the road (sound familiar?). And unless the bank finds something to do with the cash on hand, every day they will need more of those assets from the Fed to pass the test. They can't give it to another bank either because that bank is overloaded with cash too. The Fed will also only allow a single bank to get up to 80B in assets. After that, the store is closed.  
  
I don't know what happens when the banks explode from all the cash they're stuffed with, but I bet it's not a good thing for anyone. I think hyperinflation, but I'm not sure.  
  
...  
  
Now the Fed could start charging interest on RRPs. The banks would hate it, but it would take cash out of circulation. Why they haven't done this by now, only a wrinkle-brain can tell you. I don't know. But it's clearly yet another bomb ready to blow in our economy that, inexplicably, no one seems eager to defuse.  
  
I hope this helps. And I hope I'm not too far wrong on things.  Again, feedback is welcome.  I'll try to update/correct as problems are pointed out.
