Now each refresh of a GME ticker is *significantly* more likely to reflect a change (I know some of you are going through withdrawal).

Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.21089564. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.\n\nI'm not trying to permanently take over this tradition, just keep it going for fun on days when u/DerGurkenraspler doesn't start the thread at the normal time. They have been unexpectedly absent recently, but I will gladly bow out of this role when they resume updates.\n\n[Many have expressed concern](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxlrcr/udergurkenraspler/) for the founder of Diamantenh\u00e4nde. I continue to attempt to contact him, but have not received a reply. However, I have heard from someone who knows our German friend. They have indicated that he is okay, but has some external factors that he needs to focus on.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
