We can thank Aristotle for training our Western minds to think about reality as a this or that affair. Up or down, night or day, happy or sad, the list goes on and on. This dialectical way of thinking neglects the wholeness of reality and instead seeks to cut it up into discrete, easily understandable parts, like a scientist cutting up a cadaver.

In our current case of GME, shills are using that Western cognitive bias to try to create a wedge in our community by trying to make you pick a side. You’re either in it for the money or in it to create systemic change.

Guess what shills? I’m in it for both! I don’t have to choose one or the other, that’s a false choice that attempts to make me fall victim to my all or nothing thinking cognitive bias. I want to make money and I want to see systemic change and I want the criminal shfs to lose bad and there’s no reason I can’t hold all these desires simultaneously.
