    "selftext": "We can thank Aristotle for training our Western minds to think about reality as a this or that affair. Up or down, night or day, happy or sad, the list goes on and on. This dialectical way of thinking neglects the wholeness of reality and instead seeks to cut it up into discrete, easily understandable parts, like a scientist cutting up a cadaver.\n\nIn our current case of GME, shills are using that Western cognitive bias to try to create a wedge in our community by trying to make you pick a side. You\u2019re either in it for the money or in it to create systemic change.\n\nGuess what shills? I\u2019m in it for both! I don\u2019t have to choose one or the other, that\u2019s a false choice that attempts to make me fall victim to my all or nothing thinking cognitive bias. I want to make money and I want to see systemic change and I want the criminal shfs to lose bad and there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t hold all these desires simultaneously.",
    "title": "The divisive flame, being fanned by shills, of \u2018I\u2019m holding for world changing money\u2019 versus \u2018I\u2019m holding to change an unfair system\u2019 capitalizes on the cognitive bias called all or nothing thinking. We unconsciously assume something can be this or that but not this AND that.",
