Please remember apes, as you are interacting with Gamestop Social Media, that their objective is to reach gamers and promote their brand to their demographic. Yes it's fun when they tweet MOASS and Chickie Tendies, but let's not flood them with comments about Ken, Naked Short Selling, and Mayonnaise. Let's show them support by joining, contributing to, and expanding their robust community of gamers!

# We Like the Stock!!

&#x200B;

[Going back to our roots](https://preview.redd.it/kpcdut8zu3571.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=2662f922ad6457977e879c9fa4b13295c6ed3817)

There has been a lot of conversation (FUD) over the weekend about "Fuck you, pay me" and referring to being involved with trading $GME simply because you want to become rich and purely to trigger MOASS. Or because "we're Occupy Wall St. 2.0!" (**NO**).

&#x200B;

**THESE ARE NOT THE PURPOSE, INTENT, OR COLLECTIVE SENTIMENT OF THIS SUBREDDIT.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3zbjz71nd8571.jpg?width=603&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8443aa2cc8ac94db62a0ad3febc32d1d8b22708

&#x200B;

Superstonk is a community of individual investors that believe Gamestop as a company is an excellent long-term investment that has huge potential in an untapped market with an Avengers-level team of executives that will likely redefine the face of retail in the 21st century. This community was **not** made to discuss other stocks the way /WSB or /investing do. This sub is a congregation of individuals- in that sense, a collective "we or us"- that supports the vision of the company Gamestop long-term, especially its current chairman, Ryan Cohen. We like the company. We like the stock. That's it.

&#x200B;

And a little refresher on the we/us debate- **WHEN WE SAY "WE OR US", WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SUB'S COLLECTIVE WE/US AS A COMMUNITY.** There is nothing wrong with that!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2lpjdekg78571.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=12f527b70f2aaf29396f15f777129a6927c7c168

Use of the words We/Us are NOT EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULATION.

&#x200B;

Enforcement is the *key* to a manipulation case. Do we make paper hands actually pay some sort of penance for selling? **NO**. Do we have an agreed upon floor price that we all must adhere to? **Umm..... :gestures broadly at literally everyone debating possible floor price:**

Market manipulation is doing something to inflate or deflate the price of a stock. THESE are the ESTABLISHED GROUNDS for charging someone with market manipulation. And do you know how many times that's happened? [Like 5 times. And they were all people in the industry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n22g01/breakdown_of_legalese_to_speak_part_5_market/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

There's no case for market manipulation in this subreddit, or even in the GME Saga as a whole.

&#x200B;

Well, I lied. Hedgies are doing plenty.

&#x200B;

So when you see people referring to "we" or "us", *they aren't doing anything wrong.* This is a community, right? Everyone here isn't just a figment of your imagination right? **(RIGHT?!?)**

&#x200B;

[Y'all aren't imaginary, right? ](https://preview.redd.it/mpwfwnnx78571.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd9e0dc43abe93bb7b74ae1f86b55c7db615a08)

&#x200B;

We are a community of individually-minded investors. And no one can stop us from liking and discussing a stock. That's what they want you to think. **Saying "we" or "us" when talking about Superstonk is just talking about the membership of this subreddit.** There is nothing there that's illegal or negative in and of itself. All "we" do is gather here and discuss the future of a company we all love and have invested in because we believe in the future of the leadership.

What's the difference between our sub and the idea dinners the rich have been attending for decades? *The expense report*. Do you remember when American Politicians used insider information about the pandemic to profit off of the resulting crash? APES REMEMBER\*\*.\*\* Don't let FUD stop you from bonding with your fellow ape. Companionship is essential to the human experience. Get in here and love each other. It's Woodstonk 2021 up in here‚úåüíñüåº‚òÆ

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With that being said, **WE HAVE NO LEADER HERE**. r/Superstonk has administrative users that moderate the community according to site rules. That's it! When it comes to leaders, mods are just the administrators of the environment. This community was built by apes, for apes. With no one user more important than the other. **APE**= **A**ll **P**eople **E**qual ‚úä No politics. No religion. No leaders. No divisiveness. Just excellence and the stock we love.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[WE DON'T HAVE ONE!](https://preview.redd.it/lu1ryvz9f8571.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba989b8ceba279596c56a29678ccf9819f0eadea)

&#x200B;

**Here's a few notes from** u/redchessqueen99\*\*'s Weekend Update\*\*

1. Please view the DISCLAIMER associated with the subreddit. You can access it by going to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) and (on Desktop) looking at the side bar, and (on Mobile) under the About menu.
2. We do not manipulate the market. We do not coordinate anything regarding the stock market. We do not urge people to buy or sell, or do anything with what is their privately owned stock. We do not shame people for their choices as retail investors, in an attempt to get them to hold when they don't want to, or to buy GME when they'd rather buy something else. We let retail investors make their own individual decisions. That's sub policy.
3. We do not organize or attempt to push political action, or spark Occupy Wall Street 2.0 or whatever some of you think this is. We are not going to organize letters to the SEC or otherwise enter ourselves into a political arena that we, trust me, do not want to enter. We are a bunch of apes who are bananas for GameStop and that's about it.
4. We are here to share information, build a community, and express ourselves regarding GameStop as not just a stock, but also as a company, in way that is not pressuring or purposefully influential, and is based on fundamentals as well as market realities. If you don't want to talk about GameStop, there are plenty of other subs to go to, and, if you talk about GameStop, make sure you follow the rules and guidelines of the sub.
5. TL;DR: We like the stock. We love the company. We are apes. That's about it.

# Community Spotlight- WTF IS RRP

&#x200B;

[Credit u\/Itsjustmerk ](https://preview.redd.it/4unxgl9lq3571.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=9117527736696c56da3ea13d6af121ecad077067)

**So what the hecc does reverse repo mean? This comment by** u/semerien **explains it perfectly:**

A reverse repo is when banks, government entities or money market funds "buy" short term treasuries bonds from the fed with cold, hard cash.

I say "buy" because the deal is only overnight. The next day they sell them back to the fed and get their cash back.

They do this because right now interest rates are so low that if you try to maintain "highly liquid assets" (shit you can easily turn in to cash if you end up needing cash in a few minutes) you end up losing money due to inflation and short term securities turning negative interest rates.

So instead of losing money when you have large piles of money, you give the cash to the Fed overnight and then get it back the next day. Currently there is no interest rate on the reverse repo, you don't make any cash doing this.

However you don't lose cash, which you could lose by any of the other short term, highly liquid assets you could invest in.

It signifies big banks and money makers are sitting on piles of cash and don't trust any other investments right now. They would rather just store it overnight with the fed where at least they don't lose money.

There are also theories that the banks are short selling the treasuries they get during the overnight repo to try and make extra money on the deal. Definitely possible but kind of scary when you look at it.

Alot of these big banks also own money maker funds so they could technically be "double dipping" and be multiple participants in the overnight repo market.

All those banks sold bonds in the billions of dollars in April and likely had to store the cash somewhere until they need it.

But they want it to remain highly liquid so they have easy access to it on the day the financial market implodes.

# Welcome Satori Team as Moderators

by u/redchessqueen99

&#x200B;

Not many of you know the true history behind Satori and how it became so intertwined with the mod team. The truth is they've been working with me since before the [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) migration. These members include [u/catto\_del\_fatto](https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/), [u/grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/grungromp/), and [u/Captain-Fan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Captain-Fan/). They have worked meticulously and tirelessly to progress the Satori project from idea to manifest guardian ape-gel of Superstonk.

Awhile ago, we added [u/catto\_del\_fatto](https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/) and he was able to study the sub from a moderator perspective. He has earned our trust and since then has been promoted to general mod permissions. As a result, the Satori team quickly became linked to the mod team, as they became more and more critical to the sub's makeup.

In the past few months, in addition to Satori, they have helped us identify FUD attacks, organize mod mail, and identify bad actors and true apes alike. I would be wrong to suggest they aren't already a critical aspect of our moderating practice, and therefore we mods voted with overwhelming support to do the next logical step: add them as moderators.

**Please join the mod team in welcoming** [u/grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/grungromp/) **and** [u/Captain-Fan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Captain-Fan/) **to the moderator team.** I have no doubt they will continue to bring incredible concepts to life, with more accuracy and reliability, as mods themselves. Congratulations!

Also, now they can't escape \*maniacal laughter\*\*cough-cough\*

# Satori Approvals

by u/redchessqueen99

&#x200B;

[ SATORI DIRECTIVE: PR073CC 4P3 ](https://preview.redd.it/k7ysnex0n8571.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=47e34159070430ef40ca28383eeb3ab314cd8024)

&#x200B;

For those unaware, Satori is a sophisticated program that we utilize as a subreddit to identify "true apes" and also "bad actors" or people who would otherwise spread FUD and harassing posts. As a result of this software, we have been able to introduce an approval process that adds members to the Approved Users list. These approved users can bypass the [karma and age limits imposed by automod](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/automod_info).

We realize there is some confusion about Satori, and we are working on clearing this up in a more reliable way. I just created a [wiki page for Satori](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/satori) and while it is currently **under construction** you can check back there for updates on the system. This should help us streamline any questions and information, just as we do with [SuperstonkBot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/superstonkbot).

Additionally, you can check out [u/grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/grungromp/)'s post, [**Satori: The One Week Security Update (Important Information Inside)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nva7nh/satori_the_one_week_security_update_important/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), for a more recent update. The most critical aspect of this post is the new **!apeprove!** comment function, which means that any user, inside karma/age limits or not, can comment **!apeprove!** on any [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) post and be bumped to the top of the list. If your comment is immediately removed, I am told it will still work!

We have some limits imposed by Reddit, so the approvals are done in waves so as to work within this limits and Reddit policy. This **!apeprove!** function allows active users to essentially cut line. Make sure you use it! Spam will not be tolerated, though. Patience is key.
