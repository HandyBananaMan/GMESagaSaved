<p>If the squeeze can't be faked, then buy and hold into the millions. If the squeeze can be faked, then buy and hold into the millions. </p>
<p>Neither view point on this is FUD. And the advice is the same for both cases.</p>
<p>The shill accusations are out of hand. </p>
<p>Buy and hold. Whether squeeze faking is possible or not.</p>
<p>Edit: The number of awards I'm getting makes me suspicious that they are not from apes. If this has become a vehicle for shills then please remove it from hot.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Someone has set the Reddit care people on to me. I shouldn't have said pissed off. I should have just reminded everyone to seek common ground rather than differences. Apes thrive on unity. Shills fall apart without conflict. I'm fine and no one needs to worry about me. Thanks though.</p>
