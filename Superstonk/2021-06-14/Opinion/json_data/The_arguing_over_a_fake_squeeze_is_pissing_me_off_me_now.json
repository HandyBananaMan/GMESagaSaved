And the advice is the same for both cases.\n\nThe shill accusations are out of hand. \n\nBuy and hold. Whether squeeze faking is possible or not.\n\nEdit: The number of awards I'm getting makes me suspicious that they are not from apes. If this has become a vehicle for shills then please remove it from hot.\n\nEdit 2: Someone has set the Reddit care people on to me. I shouldn't have said pissed off. I should have just reminded everyone to seek common ground rather than differences. Apes thrive on unity. Shills fall apart without conflict. I'm fine and no one needs to worry about me. Thanks though.",
