Edit 2: what I was looking for https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1320xkhl0443w/naked-shorting-the-curious-incident-of-the-shares-that-didnt-exist

special thx to u/steelandquill for getting me the right article in like 21 seconds after posting <3

Can anyone please find me the article about a guy who owned a company which had smth like 4million float.
He saw his company being naked shorted into the ground untill 1 share fell to smth like 0,0007cents and decided to buy every single share(entire float).
Then on the next day, while owning the entire float of a company he saw about 40million shares exchange hands.
?
Thx in advance apes ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Edit 3: just a bit more TLDR: In 2004 it turns out it short squeezed by the quick look at it from less then a fraction of a penny to more then 1000$, go to trading view and zoom into that if you want a more detailed picture...

Edit 1: I allways knew this community was THE best, but again i got amazed how proffesional and quick you all were with answers!
Anyone wondering about how extremely corrupt the system is should read the article in the first comment, i will link it here shortly!
PS: thx for annonymous who gave me "To the stars award!"
