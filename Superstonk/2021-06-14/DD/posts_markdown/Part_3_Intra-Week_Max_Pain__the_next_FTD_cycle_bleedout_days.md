# All FTD bleed out map for the next 35 days

This is the bullshit i have to work with to figure out which days are going to be mover dates.

# #Cycle 1 - June 14 or 15 ¯_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯

Sorry for having to say 2 dates, but this whole methodology does have its little +-1 day rule thing so... Yeah 14'th or 15'th.

Already pre-determined ages ago in my previous anal-ysis here: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/t15y2iPt-GME-FTD-Reset-Cycle-Update/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/t15y2iPt-GME-FTD-Reset-Cycle-Update/)

# #Cycle 2 - June 21 AND 22 ( ‾ʖ̫‾)

I believe based on these T+21 and T+25 overlaps that we're going to see the classic T+18 or T+19 enacted for this case.

* They will shit/short on GME on Monday 21'st because there is NO FTD cycle to reset on this date.
* They will reset or let the rest of the T+21 and T+35 overlaps get "covered" on the 22'nd of June all together in 1 batch.

# #Cycle 3 - 30 June, July 1-2 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

This is a difficult cycle to decipher. There's a boatload of FTD reset or bleeds coinciding in the same week and they're FTD reset or bleeds from days where they shorted GME BIG time.

This should be a juicy cycle. They have to deliver, bleed, reset or re-short a hefty amount of GME shares this time around.

Because of the large amount they need to decide on what to do, their strategy is likely to deviate from normal cycle reset, bleed or re-short parameters hence why it's a difficult to decipher cycle. There's a person on the other side thinking how to deal with this and i'm here trying to think like them.

![The whole map so you can see that these FTD reset or bleed days are based on days they shorted GME big time. It means the effect of those FTD Resets or Bleeds will be decently big this time around. \(Insert can kicking gone wrong\).](https://preview.redd.it/nacre8qih8571.png?width=2445&format=png&auto=webp&s=fff6398599965d480d23c676da82b33754f9d29a)

I'm going to wing this one and say this is going to be a heavy week of 3 whole days where they have to deal with delivering a boatload of GME shares. Due to the volume of shit they need to deal with, i think we're going to see some pre-work e.g them dropping the price before and during these reset-days.

**What will happen:**

* Scrape the bottom of the barrel for borrowable shares sometime between 22-25 June.
* Create more synthetics using Married Puts sometime between 22-25 June.
* Drop GME's price on Friday 25'th of June in preparation of this week.
* Drop GME's price on the 28'th and the 29'th.
* Proceed to have massive upwards and downwards volatility on the 30'th, 1'st and 2'nd.

# #Cycle 4 - July 8 ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°)

I think this cycle will be shit for apes. There's barely any FTD cycles converging together. This will be a good week for hedgies (market maker/s) to drop GME's price unhindered.

God i hope i'm wrong on this one.

* 8'th of July to be a minor price mover date.
* The rest of the week to be dog-shite. I hope it's just side-ways and not too much downwards.

# Conclusion

Reminder that this methodology doesn't predict which way GME will move. It predicts BIG mover days... you know, unlike days where the price barely moves.

I think that the July 4-8 cycle will be a really shit one, but it's also perfect because people get paid near those dates so, it'll be a tasty dip.

I have nothing else to say.

Tagging u/buttfarm69 as usual for no reason that i can think of. Just doing it because i can.
