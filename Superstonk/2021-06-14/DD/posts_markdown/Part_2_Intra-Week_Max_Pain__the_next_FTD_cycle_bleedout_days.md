# My own methodology & proof it works

I don't follow anyone else's methodology here on Superstonk, nor am i interested to do so. I haven't seen someone successfully and perfectly predict future dates where T+21's and T+35's would move the price of GME up or down.

I've come up with my own methodology that's able to predict these FTD Reset Cycle T+21 - T+35 days down to a +-1 day level of accuracy. See below proof that my model works in predicting these dates almost to perfection.

Here's proof: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/t15y2iPt-GME-FTD-Reset-Cycle-Update/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/t15y2iPt-GME-FTD-Reset-Cycle-Update/)

# Methodology Intro - Naming

Now as to the way to extrapolate/predict (whatever you want to call it), the FTD Reset Cycle bleed out days, i'll show you below, but first i'd like to just explain why i call it "FTD Reset Cycle bleed out days".

As the wording implies, a "FTD Reset Cycle Bleed Out Day" is a day on which the hedgies (Yes i will continue to call them hedgies, cause fuck em, they're not victims) or market maker/s are forced to deal with the effects of their intra T+21 and T+35 shorting activities.

These days are NOT fixed. They are not perfectly T+21 or T+35 from some random fixed day/date people here on superstonk seem to have concluded (wrongly in my opinion).

I'll explain below how the whole FTD cycle and bleed out days work in my opinion (Proven opinion).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Methodology Intro - How it works - Count the T+21's and T+35's

*^(\*Note: Not trying to shit on anyone or their theories/methods. I'm purely trying to explain me methodology and need to show comparisons against the other methodologies out there.)*

*Simple*

1. Take a day where you believe a decent amount of shorting occurred.
2. Count T+21 days from that date into the future.
3. Count T+35 days from that date into the future.

Now repeat this for all other dates on which you believe there was decent shorting going on. (Yes assume all red candles are baddies shorting)

At this point you should have a pretty ugly looking chart with too many lines showing a boatload of T+21's and T+35's.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Methodology Intro - How it works - Consolidate T+21's and T+35's

Here's a very nice, simple and non convoluted example of marking, counting and consolidating (some) T+21's and T+35's. This example will show you that TODAY (14 June) is an FTD Reset Cycle Bleed Out Day.

You'll notice that i've ignored some pretty shorted days. This is intentional and done as to not add too many lines and confuse apes. The ones i've added are perfectly enough to illustrate the methodology.

*Points Used*

* **May 10, May 11:** The 2 x blue T+35's to me look unnatural, these are perfect examples to use in this methodology of identifying FTD Reset Cycle Bleed Out Days. Their T+35 ends today June 14 and June 15.
* **May 25:** What else coincides with the 14'th of June or at least something close to it? There's a couple of T+21's that started on the 25'th of May that are very close to the 14'th of June. In fact this one ends on June 16. These aren't very pronounced shorting dates, but i've added them regardless.
* **May 28:** This is a pretty heavy shorting day. I've added it since it's somewhat near-ish to our example date of June 14 (today) because MAYBE it's important, MAYBE it isnt.

So now we have possible FTD Reset Cycle Bleed Out Dates. But wait... it's not that simple... It never is.

# Methodology Intro - How it works - The Magic Sauce

>*Think like a hedgie. Be the hedgie. See the world through the hedgie's eyes.*

*^(\*Note: I realize i'm self jerking right now, but please let me have it.)*

You have the following 4 FTD Reset Cycle dates in range of each other:

1. June 14
2. June 15
3. June 16
4. June 18

Keep these dates in mind for later because we're going to use them to predict when the hedgies are going to succ the proverbial FTD.

&#x200B;

You're a Market Maker (Because hedgies can't T+21 or T+35, only Market Makers can) and you shorted GME on these 4 separate days T+21 and T+35 ago. These are the dates that you now have to deliver/settle those trades on.

Because you're a hedgie (market maker), you don't wanna be caught failing to deliver especially on GME where everyone's eyes are on GME's FTDs because of what you did back in January. You've made sure to STOP FTD'ing since January's "Sneeze".

![Chart is related. It's the FTD Share Quantities since January. Notice how they're now \\"Managing\\" their FTD's. They don't want to attract unwanted attention.](https://preview.redd.it/8ogz8e4rk7571.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cc2e0b31536493976bd9512c4e3a8076497a999)

&#x200B;

**Let's recap a bit**

* You're a hedgie (Market Maker)
* You shorted GME T+21 and T+35 days ago multiple times.
* It's time to deliver, cover, short more or kick the can.
* Failing to Deliver is NOT an option anymore due to everyone watching closely.

What do you do? Let's check the next section.

# Methodology Intro - How it works - The Human Factor

This chart again.

https://preview.redd.it/nmxy72lsn7571.png?width=2444&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f9294993a1cc3e63412c7e64626600168bbe60f

And these dates again.

1. June 14
2. June 15
3. June 16
4. June 18

So the question is, what comes next? How do i predict the future?

&#x200B;

**Actually that's NOT the right question.** The right question is, what happened before this big cluster of T+21's and T+35's.

![That's right. Shorted on T+18 and T+33.](https://preview.redd.it/mmf96u6jo7571.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec50ab88db0b73c608a499caadaec22b64718e7e)

**THIS** is the hedgies (Market Makers) doing their thing right before the big cluster of FTD Cycle Bleed Out Days. You blinked and you missed it because you were too busy counting T+21's and T+35's to realize that you're supposed to kick the can BEFORE T+21 and T+35.

I mean who kicks the can on exactly the last day that they're supposed to deliver? **Hence the human factor in all this.**

This is not a fully automated procedure you're seeing. You can see now how there's a person behind this that understands the real life reprecussions of not delivering on T+21 or T+35 and how dangerous it would  be to try and deliver EXACTLY on T+21 or close to it.

This is why the hedgies (Market Maker), are performing their actions 2-4 days before the cycles end.

I'll let you digest this part and i'll move on to the next section.

# Methodology Intro - How it works - T+19 and T+31-34

At this point i'm spoon-feeding you my verified findings on how they operate. I've already gone through 3-4 iterations of testing my FTD Cycle Bleed Out theory over the past 4 months. What i'm giving you is literally the perfectly triple distilled version.

Here's one of my failed iterations vs the distilled perfect one.

[Refined Cycle](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/t15y2iPt-GME-FTD-Reset-Cycle-Update/)

[Unrefined Cycle](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/GME/9Xx8vMxs-GME-They-are-now-shorting-while-resetting-FTDs/)

**TLDR** they always do their dirty work on T+19 for any T+21 periods coming up. For T+35 periods they prefer to do their dirty work on T+31-34.

So basically if you see a T+21 and/or T+35 cycle close to each other, deduct a couple of days and that's your GME price mover day. Simple as that.

https://preview.redd.it/csrbj7cdt7571.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8f9fc18ff5671a7d8a93036d6f7e8718aa1b31c

On this chart, the flags DONT indicate T+21's and T+35's. Again that would be too easy and it wouldn't work.

The flags here indicate T+18 or T+19 clusters (grouped FTD Reset events) and T+31's - T+34's. You can see the accuracy of this prediction based on historical shorting dates.

&#x200B;

# Can this methodology say which way GME will move?

Unfortunately not... yet.

All this (and other FTD theories) can say is the date on which GME is bound for a decent move. It can't perfectly tell you whether the move will be UP or DOWN.

The reason for this is that this depends on the person planning his strategy for the T+21 and T+35 cycles ends. It's easy to understand WHEN this person is going to do his moves (before the cycles), but it's not perfectly easy to understand what the move will actually be.

I'm working on this part, but it's more difficult to decode/understand because the movement of GME is based on someone's strategy/mindset and it's not easy to understand your enemy just by looking at a chart.

One thing's for sure, the other side will definitely short GME if they think it's too high/dangerous to them and that's the one indicator i have for now.

&#x200B;

# Future Mover Dates

Let's take a look at these dates again. These are the T+21 and T+35'er dates for this week.

1. June 14
2. June 15
3. June 16
4. June 18

https://preview.redd.it/8gjyuuq4u7571.png?width=2444&format=png&auto=webp&s=825b7af82a3baa8c10006e2d22bfcbb5e30c210d

Since they have 4 T+21 and T+35 cycles ending all in the same week, their plan for last was to drop the price as much as possible LAST week so that once their FTD's / Deliverables get locked in today and in the next few days, they won't feel the pain as much and they get to live for a little while longer.

There's one of two (3 really) things that could happen this week:

* Trade Lock-Ins
* They'll "Cover" their T+21 and T+35 trades a bit
* Both

They've shorted GME to shit last week. Convinced this is NOT the 5 million ATM offering due to the option trading activity and married puts i saw last week. I'm convinced this is their usual game.

If you use this methodology but in history/past of GME's chart, you'll see 2-3 more dates on which they've done the EXACT same thing of dropping GME massively when there would be a BIG FTD Reset Cycle Bleed Out week ahead of them. It's their way of coping.

The problem for them is that this is just another "Kick the can" strategy, but they don't seem to mind doing it and neither do i to be honest because it keeps things predictable.

&#x200B;

So...

This week, i believe since there's so much T+21 and T+35 clustering and they've already done their big move last week, this week we're going to see a mix of forced buy-ins (Lock-Ins) and them also buying-in a bit.

Last week at the start of the week, they were scraping the bottom of the barrel for borrowable shares, then in the middle of the week they used Married Puts for \~600 000 shares worth of options. Then towards the end of the week they dropped GME's price by so much. The can is getting bigger and harder to kick.

I'm going to trust my old prediction here and say that **TODAY 14'th** is going to be a decently big mover date. 99% convinced based on my methodology that this will be the case. I  believe that the 14, 15, 16 and 18 are ALL going to be "covered" manually by them or locked in today. Now allowing for a +-1 day margin of error, it could happen tomorrow.

About the price movement, i want to say it's going to be upwards, but i don't know. My methodology doesn't account for that.
