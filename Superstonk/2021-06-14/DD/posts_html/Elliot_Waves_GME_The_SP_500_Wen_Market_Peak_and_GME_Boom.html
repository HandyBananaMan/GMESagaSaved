<p>Sup Apes</p>
<p>Not Financial Advice</p>
<p>I'm so honored to finally have the Elliot Wave Guy flair!!! I post on twitter pretty consistently now, if you wanna see snippets of analysis and whatnot intraday (also in the event my reddit gets hacked) <a href="https://twitter.com/gavinmayreal">https://twitter.com/gavinmayreal</a></p>
<p>Please remember this is all just my theory, I can very well be wrong. I‚Äôm just an ape who want banana üçå </p>
<p>This post isn't gonna be talking about GME's wave's as much, rather the broader market, and how we can use SPX (I'm gonna be referencing $SPY in this post, ETF that tracks the SP500, SPYDER GANG) as a gauge of when to expect some erratic GME movement.</p>
<p>I have one request before I begin, please blast this song while reading, it sets the mood: <a href="https://youtu.be/MN3x-kAbgFU">https://youtu.be/MN3x-kAbgFU</a></p>
<p>Okay then, hope everyone is having an amazing evening! I think it's a pretty safe assumption to assume that the majority of apes here understand the GME situation pretty well. What I'm gonna be focusing on in this post is how we can use elliot waves on SPY to not only predict the top of this absurd, seemingly endless bull market, but more importantly, how we can use these targets on the broader market in relation to GME.</p>
<p>We all know by now that GME is a negative beta stock. Simply put, <strong>Beta</strong> is a numeric value that measures the fluctuations of a stock to changes in the overall stock market. Beta measures the responsiveness of a stock's price to changes in the overall stock market. ... The volatility of the stock and systematic risk can be judged by calculating beta.</p>
<p>normal stocks have a positive beta, usually around 1.0, meaning if the market (SPY) drops 1 point, we can assume said ticker will drop 1 point as well. idk what GME's beta is as of now, though it's probably something ridiculously negative (anyone with a bloomberg terminal wanna lmk the actual beta?). I've seen numbers ranging from -5 to -40... needless to say, GME does indeed have a negative beta.</p>

<p>There have been many great thesis's drafted regarding GME boom = market crash, which I think are completely true. In short, the market crash makes GME moon, or GME moon causes the market crash. why? I know people have noticed the wild crip toe fluctuations and drops, this is partly attributed to capital requirements, meaning if shorts don't post collateral by x time on x date, marge comes a calling.</p>
<p>But think about the stock market. It's no secret that hedgies are also long certain stocks, after all they manage billions and billions of dollars. Citadel recent 13f: <a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link</a></p>
<p>Do note the last reported 13f is 3/31, reported quarterly.  </p>
<p>Interesting how their largest position reported is short SPY huh? Anyways, not much of a point digging through their holdings, you can if you want but I don't see it as a super useful way to spend your time.</p>
<p>if (when) the market takes a turn and enters a bear market, needless to say their long positions lose value. What happens when their long positions are suddenly worth less and they need to post collateral to avoid marge calling in... See where I'm going with this?</p>
<p>onto the wavvveeeesssssss</p>
<p>Below is a monthly view of SPY:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zcixym1ryb571.png?width=2806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77a13dc04e487c3bc835b2ce7effece18a133f5e">monthly</a></p>
<p>This is our SUPER CYCLE, starting from the low of the 08 fin crisis. Now let's zoom in and see where we're at on a smaller scale:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/uaddjcq9zb571.png?width=2798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb59c92f783dea2038c2bbf9683035802e2b61ee">4 hr compressed</a></p>
<p>Remember, the order for wave cycles is grand super cycle, super cycle, cycle, primary, intermediate, and so on. What's important is you can distinguish where we are at in any cycle. For SPY, we are actually in the 5th wave of our 5th wave of our 5th wave... can anyone tell me what that means?</p>
<p>I'll wait...</p>
<p>come on...</p>
<p>I know you know...</p>
<p>Okay fine I'll tell you. Using EW, we can clearly see that we are nearing the tippy top of this raging bull market. From a grand super cycle standpoint alone, my next target comes out to 428.5, and my cycle 5 (not super cycle, too lazy to draw a bunch of lines lol) target comes out to 429.69 (nice).</p>
<p>now, this under no circumstances is saying SPY will peak at exactly 429.69 and begin to trend downward (though that would be pretty fucking funny right, i mean 69? come on, doesn't get any better than that). However, what we DO know is that GME and the rest of the market are correlated.</p>
<p>So, my working thesis is that the top of the stock market is not only predictable, but imminent. Tying this into GME, well, you know the rest.</p>
<p>Speaking of GME, a little update on the waaavvveees:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ps95juwk0c571.png?width=2756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc84bd970491b8f31d3facb099aea623cec08ad0">4hr</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/b7c7cfbm0c571.png?width=2812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79ac4557d86f4ade0aca08e93d85a2feac5a737d">1hr</a></p>
<p>Do note, we have not actually hit the 61.8% retracement of our cycle 1 (201), we under no circumstances have to hit that for the structure to be valid. In fact, the structure is valid unless we break under 112.83 (bottom of cycle 1), so I wouldn't worry about that at all haha. I'm still waiting for a significant move to give updated GME upside targets, tis a waiting game for now. What's new? Wish I had more time, need more shares.</p>
<p>Regarding SPY, because this is our super cycle, and we are nearing the peak, that means that we must then correct that entire move via an ABC correction, targeting minimum 50% of that entire move. Where does that put SPY when all is said and done?</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/bbfh7wzi1c571.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1502f44228277e07070d84570fd9d8be4752b7b6">SHEEEEEEESH</a></p>
<p>50% of the entire 5 wave super cycle puts SPY at 247.67 (assuming \~ 429 is the top). It could go higher than 429 without a doubt, though i doubt much higher in all honesty.</p>
<p>Alright, I think I covered everything. Thanks for reading and have a great rest of your night!</p>
<p>TLDR: The top of the market is imminent, using EW, we are literally at the tippy top with only a few points till bear market ensues. GME moves inverse the market for a variety of reasons... the market is near the top, GME moves inverse the market, the market is near the top............ mmm yes it's all coming together...</p>
<p>JACKED TO INFINITY!!! BUY AND HODL!!! üöÄ</p>
<p>edit: okay, maybe let's dance isn't the best song to listen to for this, remember the big shorts' "dont fucking dance?" my bad, gme exciting, rest of market for everyone not in GME, not so much. Have updated with another banger, also sets the mood :)</p>
<p>edit 2: Just for reference, here is SPY vs GME at the end of January: </p>
