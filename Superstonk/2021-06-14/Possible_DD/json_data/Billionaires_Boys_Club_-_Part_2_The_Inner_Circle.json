TR UMP pardoned this guy on 18th Feb 2020.\n\nWhat struck me about this, was that he had 33 people lobbying Tr ump to get his Pardon.

(Again... I'll try keep po litics out of this, but this is establishing connections)\n\n[Reference Forbes Article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/windriver/2021/05/07/open-source-brings-collective-creativity-to-the-intelligent-edge/?sh=7f6db7ab321a)\n\n(Can you spot all 6?)\n\nI'm not going to go through ALL of it as there is WAY too much, but it's safe to say... there are a lot of connections\n\nBut here are a few examples to wet your confirmation bias...\n\n[Elaine Chao and Kenny hanging out at a Milken event with \"The worlds most powerful thinkers\"](https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-milken-conference-trump-idCAKBN17Y26U-OCABS)\n\n[Kenny, David Rubenstein, Mark Weinberger, Steven Tananbaum all hanging out at the Milken Global Conference in 2017](https://milkeninstitute.org/events/global-conference-2017/speakers)\n\n[Kenny buys Rupert Murdochs ex Wife's House](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/residential-real-estate/what-will-billionaire-ken-griffin-build-his-huge-palm-beach-estate)\n\n(Can't make this shit up)\n\n\\+ This Milken Institute seems to be central for a lot of these guys...\n\nANYWAY....\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn to the shit we care about.\n\nWe've established that there's a Billionaires Boys Club and Kenny is Part of it.\n\nSo let's take the Sessa and Apollo pattern and see if we can expand on it.\n\nWhat are we looking for?\n\nCompanies that own Puts, that first reported ownership in Q1 2021 and that have not hedged.\n\nThis gives us this list:\n\n**Taconic Capital Advisors:** 537,900 shares valued at $102 million\n\n**Hound Partners LLC:** 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million\n\n**CMT Capital Markets Trading:** 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million (Sounds familiar)\n\n**Millennium Management LLC:** 163,400 shares valued at $31 million\n\n**Apollo Management Holdings:** 150,000 shares valued at $28.5 million (We know who this is)\n\n**CSS LLC:** 71,000 Shares valued at $13.5 million\n\n**Jefferies Group LLC:** 48,000 shares valued at $9 million (Jefferies?

Smaller position.\n\nFinra does have a check on them though ([Ref: LINK](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/45980))\n\nAnd it shows a single Director: Peter Anthony Ianello\n\nAfter doing some solid Googling, it turns out he goes by Peter Ianello and is actually the founder of a different company... OCA Ventures.\n\nI searched them for a 13F, but doesn't exist. (Ref: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc))\n\nBut they are out of Chicago and both Kenny and Peter made it to the Chicago 100 list:\n\n[http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html](http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html)\n\nA cross-reference with Milken shows that both guys are listed as business speakers for events... but that's meh...\n\nThat's all I could get for this one... but I am even more suspicious of these smaller funds.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ionic Capital Management** was a hard nut too\n\nFounders were not listed in Linkedin, but I found [an article](https://www.globalvolatilitysummit.com/sponsor/ionic/) listing 3 Co-Founders for the company:\n\nBart Baum\n\nAdam Radosti\n\nDaniel Stone\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYET AGAIN... another article talking about Kenny and one of these companies making unusual plays.\n\nHere they talk about Citadel And Ionic (Specifically just these 2) being bullish on a company called Verb. -- ONLY 4 hedge funds in total were trading this company!!!\n\nKen created the largest position and Ionic had the highest weighting.\n\nAnd weirdly... in the article... it says both companies had $0 million as their position. lol.
