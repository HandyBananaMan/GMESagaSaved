Through intense research, focused on understanding the competitive dynamics of the industry and their impact on the company\u2019s prospects, we believe we are able to successfully pick those companies which are simply misunderstood versus truly broken.\n\nLove it!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe already spoke about the **Sessa YOLO**, but not to worry... we'll circle back on these puppets.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother big mover...\n\n**Prelude Capital Management** 1.2 million shares of GME PUTS valued at $242 million representing 6% of their portfolio and their 3rd largest position.\n\n**Co-Founded by** [**Gavin Saitowitz**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-saitowitz-298289/) **and** [**Cisco Del Valle**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciscojdelvalle/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gavin](https://preview.redd.it/9dya73jada571.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=afc114419970fc96f18d14900e095f46111c30fc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cisco](https://preview.redd.it/i7la1cicda571.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=faabce23b7ab45c2b6361d139d82925ec88be7ea)\n\nSo these guys have owned GME previously, but since their last 13F, have increased that position by 1,264,700 shares of PUTS.\n\nMeaning... that's more than a 10,000% increase in their position.\n\nRemember my first DD that started me down this rabbit hole?\n\n[(Check it out here if not)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nyt6l8/wrinkle_brains_needed_citadel_loading_up_on_high/)\n\nBut that was focused on the junk bonds and particularly $HYG\n\nWell give a guess who else is HEAVY on $HYG PUTS?\n\nYup... Our boys at Prelude.\n\nReference: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/springbok-capital-management-llc#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/springbok-capital-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)\n\nThey own 531,000 shares of PUTS in this junk bond worth $46 million and making up 1.19% of their portfolio after increasing their position by 151%.\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nThey own 450,865 shares of the stock itself.\n\nNow you may think this is just a hedge, but they added 419,906 of these shares since their last filing. (An increase of 1,356%)\n\nSo what's interesting about this???\n\nWell the top position in these guys portfolio is SPY (PUTS) - 863,100 shares valued at $342,072,000\n\nAnd... in at 7th position they have QQQ (PUT) at 173,100 shares valued at $55.5 million\n\nSo they're betting that the market is going to crash and they are jumping into GME and HYG Puts.\n\n(Funnily enough, Citdel's largest position is also SPY (PUTS) at 6.2% of their portfolio with 63.8million shares valued at $25 Billion)\n\nBoth Companies have hedged against this, but both companies are betting the market is going down and are jumping to bonds.\n\nSo we all know Citadel's relationship with GME, but why if this company knows EVERYTHING that Citadel seems to know, would they increase their PUTS on GME by 10,000%? UNLESS... they are helping?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd this HYG seems to be the lifeboat Apes. Look at the increase of the BIG BOYS jumping on HYG PUTS:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(See Taconic in there right at the end too?\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qwsqqd21ga571.png?width=1721&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e00c355a48f96e2c6ef4ae1e8f16779b3686926)\n\nJane Street has HYG in their top 10 after increasing the PUTS by 150%!\n\n(Interestingly Jane Street are decreasing their SPY PUTS and Increasing their SPY CALLS)\n\n\\- But lets get back on topic.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho else is jumping on the HYG Bandwagon?\n\nHow about **Ares Management**? A Brand New Position with 2 million shares valued at $174 million and their 4th largest position?\n\nRef: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ares-management-llc#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ares-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)\n\nHow about **Jefferies Group**? 1,342,700 HYG (PUTS) valued at $117 million and their 13th largest position. (They also have their top position in SPY(PUTS) - 2,435,608 million shares valued at $965 million. And QQQ(PUT) at 2.3 million shares valued at $759 million.\n\nRef: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/jefferies-group-inc-de#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/jefferies-group-inc-de#tabholdings_tab_link)\n\nHow about **GoldenTree Assets**? Buying the underlying stock this time, and actually decreasing it's position but still at 1,150,000 shares valued at $100 million and their 6th largest position. (You may remember these guys from Billionaires Boys Club Part 2, who also have a large PUT position in AMC)\n\nRef: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/goldentree-asset-management-lp#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/goldentree-asset-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link)\n\nHow about **Blackstone Group**? Brand new position opened up (Late to the party) HYG (PUT) 100,000 shares at $8.7 million value. These guys also have SPY (PUT) at 9,084,800 valued at $3.8 Billion as their 4th largest position. +QQQ Puts at $2.1 Billion at 5th position\n\nRef: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/blackstone-group-l-p#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/blackstone-group-l-p#tabholdings_tab_link)\n\nAll of these companies seem to be making SIMILAR moves. Not identical by any means, and I'm sure there are lots of differences.\n\nBut the moves also similar to Citadels Moves.\n\nI mean FFS... They are ALL saying the market is about to CRASH! Including Citadel!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd are we **READY FOR THE BOMB DROP?**\n\nWhat do all of these companies have in Common?\n\nThey are ALL run by  Drexel Burnham Lambert Alumni!!\n\nYup... He's at the center of it again!\n\nReference: [https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/13/where-are-they-now-the-drexel-alumni-25-years-later.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/13/where-are-they-now-the-drexel-alumni-25-years-later.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmu5jjnhta571.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ca2e7d8d5dc97dd4a4e12758ad79725a67f065\n\nI'm not done yet... Just done for today\n\nBBC Volume 4 will be out tomorrow if you guys are still interested in this shit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBIG FUCKING EDIT: The Source Date for RC Ventures is Jan 10th and Hestia Capital for 12th June 2020. **ALL OTHER MARKET VALUES ARE AS OF 31ST MARCH**...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 4: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0isaz/billionaire\\_boys\\_club\\_bbc\\_part\\_4\\_recess\\_is\\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0isaz/billionaire_boys_club_bbc_part_4_recess_is_over/)",
