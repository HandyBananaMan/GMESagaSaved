<p>So I spent this morning's pre-market browsing some 13Fs, (This is the way) and I came across a little-known hedge fund called Sessa Capital.</p>
<p>What stood out to me about this hedge fund, was their huge overweight position of 1.8 million GME puts. (Correction 1.8 million shares of GME Puts estimated at $351 million value)</p>
<p>This is now the fund's biggest position, accounts for 13.5% of their portfolio, and get this... they had not traded Gamestop prior to Q1 2021.</p>
<p>So I thought to myself... what could have possibly INSPIRED this fund to go all in on a Gamestop short after the Jan mini-squeeze. Isn't that a bit of a suicide mission? Especially for a fund with such a good track record...</p>
<p>...AND they have not even hedged this position...</p>
<p>So I looked into the fund a little and found it is run by a guy named John Petry.</p>
<p>My immediate thought was... I bet he's connected to Shitadel somehow.</p>
<p>I looked him up on Linkedin... not a past employee.</p>
<p>I checked his Fund's New York Address expecting it to be in the same building as Kenny.</p>
<p>It's not...</p>
<p>But it's not far:</p>

<p>And even closer to Kenny's gaff</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/7wpgbmq0t7571.png?width=2555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c940633bb3865cfb7e5da6c64797ecc1337feac7">(Could easily pop around for a cup of tea)</a></p>
<p>But realistically... proximity in New York means nothing.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>I decided to dig a little deeper.</p>
<p>I discovered that John Petry is on the Board of a company called "Success Academy", which is a New York City Charter School Network. (Part of the "Billionaire's Boys Club" which is described as a crew of hedge fund managers and philanthropists who are the angels behind private management charters)</p>
<p>- Reference: <a href="https://preaprez.wordpress.com/tag/education-reform-now/">https://preaprez.wordpress.com/tag/education-reform-now/</a></p>
<p>John Petry got on the board by being one of these early Angel Investors in the Carter School. And give a guess who's name is right there along side his?</p>
<p>Yup...</p>
<p>Mr Kenny "Give me my Tendies" Griffin was also an Angel Investor of $10 million in this charter school.</p>

<p>So let's Dig a little deeper...</p>

<p>So when I was reading up on our new friend (And Kenny's old friend), John Petry, something that stud out to me was this:</p>
<p><strong><em>" Petryâ€™s Gotham Capital LLC, founded in 1985 with $7 million from junk-bond king Michael Milken "</em></strong></p>
<p>Junk Bonds again...</p>
<p>And who was this Junk Bond King, Michael Milken... and how is he connected to all this...</p>
<p>AND OF COURSE... IT'S THIS GUY:</p>

<p>And I'm sure there's a bunch more out there...</p>
<p>So who the fuck is Michael Milken?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/nxqeipdhx7571.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57747b773d9ddad4538ffd495201ec970f3f4d96</p>
<p>Michael Robert Milken (born July 4, 1946) is an American formerly convicted felon, financier and philanthropist. <strong>He is noted for his role in the development of the market for high-yield bonds ("junk bonds")</strong>,[3] and his conviction and sentence following a guilty plea on felony charges for violating U.S. securities laws.[4] Since his release from prison, he has also become known for his charitable giving.[5][6] Milken was pardoned by President Donald Trump on February 18, 2020.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Milken was indicted for racketeering and securities fraud in 1989 in an insider trading investigation.</strong> As the result of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to securities and reporting violations but not to racketeering or insider trading. Milken was sentenced to ten years in prison, fined $600 million, and permanently barred from the securities industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. His sentence was later reduced to two years for cooperating with testimony against his former colleagues and for good behavior.[7] Since his release from prison, Milken has funded medical research.[8]</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>So the guy who INVENTED the Junk Bond market, gets banned from ever trading again... and then all of a sudden becomes best buddies with Kenny G... who trades extensively in Junk Bonds?</p>
<p>And... the same guy funds the company prior to John Petry's current Fund, and the current fund decides to Yolo into GME shorts AFTER Jan mini squeeze.</p>
<p>And just in case you are thinking this guy would be too afraid to break a lifetime ban?</p>
<p><strong><em>In February 2013, the SEC announced that they were investigating whether Milken violated his lifetime ban from the securities industry. The investigation revolved around Milken allegedly providing investment advice through Guggenheim Partners.[42]</em></strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>Since 2011, the SEC has been investigating Guggenheim's relationship with Milken.[43]</em></strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>These guys are all fucking connected!</p>
<p>But of Course... this is just my opinion and I can't prove anything... nor am I a financial advisor.</p>

<p>Edit 1: Sessa Puts Source</p>
<p>Sorry Apes, I don't trade options so my terminology was off. It's 1.8 million shares of GME Puts valued at $351 million. Not 1.8 million puts</p>
