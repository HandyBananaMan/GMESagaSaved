<p>Ok, you apes got me all riled up now after the positive reaction to my last post  (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nzkzi5/is_this_the_final_boss_john_petry_and_ken_griffin/">Ref Boys Club Part 1</a>) so I've decided to keep digging.</p>
<p>Let's start with Our New Super Villian Michael "Milky" Milken:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/7li64nzrk9571.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcde810dc36c5dda25784896d52d37d983b9dcb</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm Irish and have no real interest in American pol itics, so I know once I mention this shit's gonna get political, but lets try and not...</p>
<p>We're all Apes, we're all here for the Stonk... not for Poli tics.</p>
<p>So... TR UMP pardoned this guy on 18th Feb 2020.</p>
<p>What struck me about this, was that he had 33 people lobbying Tr ump to get his Pardon. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/michael-milken-trump-pardon.html">Ref New York Times</a>)</p>
<p>Now, when you click on the link to get the White Houses statement on who these 33 people are, it brings up a 404 error... The statement no longer exists!</p>
<p>But luckily, this Ape has heard of the way back machine!</p>
<p>So using the way back machine, we can get the 33 names. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200313203638/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-2/">Ref Wayback Machine</a>)</p>

<p>So fuck me Apes...</p>
<p>This guy has some friend list willing to go to bat for him right?</p>
<p>Can't even count the amount of Billionaires up there and this is just the list of people issued in the official Whitehouse statement (That mysteriously no longer exists)</p>
<p><strong>So... on with the connections.</strong></p>
<p>Let's cross-reference our hedgies with our favorite stonk.</p>
<p>John Paulson Hedgie #1 - Does not have a position in GME according to latest 13F.</p>
<p>Neither does Hedgie #2, though he does have a small up of a million shares on AMC</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>How about our investment firms?</strong></p>
<p>Josh Harris at Apollo Global Management decided in Q1 of 2021 that he would trade GME for the first time with a small put position of 150,000 Shares. (<a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/apollo-management-holdings-l-p#tabholdings_tab_link">Ref Holdings</a>) - Similar Timing to Sessa Maybe?</p>
<p>But other than that... not a whole load more to report.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>How about connections to Kenny Himself?</strong></p>
<p>Well there's a SHITLOAD of that...</p>
<p>Here's just 1 article, referencing 6 of our 33 hitlist in addition to Kenny himself referencing donations to the Repu blican party. (Again... I'll try keep po litics out of this, but this is establishing connections)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/windriver/2021/05/07/open-source-brings-collective-creativity-to-the-intelligent-edge/?sh=7f6db7ab321a">Reference Forbes Article</a></p>
<p>(Can you spot all 6?)</p>
<p>I'm not going to go through ALL of it as there is WAY too much, but it's safe to say... there are a lot of connections</p>
<p>But here are a few examples to wet your confirmation bias...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-milken-conference-trump-idCAKBN17Y26U-OCABS">Elaine Chao and Kenny hanging out at a Milken event with "The worlds most powerful thinkers"</a></p>
<p><a href="https://milkeninstitute.org/events/global-conference-2017/speakers">Kenny, David Rubenstein, Mark Weinberger, Steven Tananbaum all hanging out at the Milken Global Conference in 2017</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/residential-real-estate/what-will-billionaire-ken-griffin-build-his-huge-palm-beach-estate">Kenny buys Rupert Murdochs ex Wife's House</a></p>
<p>(Can't make this shit up)</p>
<p>+ This Milken Institute seems to be central for a lot of these guys...</p>
<p>ANYWAY....</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>On to the shit we care about.</p>
<p>We've established that there's a Billionaires Boys Club and Kenny is Part of it.</p>
<p>So let's take the Sessa and Apollo pattern and see if we can expand on it.</p>
<p>What are we looking for?</p>
<p>Companies that own Puts, that first reported ownership in Q1 2021 and that have not hedged.</p>
<p>This gives us this list:</p>
<p><strong>Taconic Capital Advisors:</strong> 537,900 shares valued at $102 million</p>
<p><strong>Hound Partners LLC:</strong> 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million</p>
<p><strong>CMT Capital Markets Trading:</strong> 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million (Sounds familiar)</p>
<p><strong>Millennium Management LLC:</strong> 163,400 shares valued at $31 million</p>
<p><strong>Apollo Management Holdings:</strong> 150,000 shares valued at $28.5 million (We know who this is)</p>
<p><strong>CSS LLC:</strong> 71,000 Shares valued at $13.5 million</p>
<p><strong>Jefferies Group LLC:</strong> 48,000 shares valued at $9 million (Jefferies? WTF)</p>
<p><strong>Ionic Capital Management:</strong> 20,600 shares valued at $4million</p>
<p>There's more... but that's enough for now.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The second biggest NEW put position is <strong>Taconic Capital</strong></p>
<p>Founder of Taconic, is Frank Brosens.</p>
<p>Frank Brosens was invited to speak at the Invest for Kids Event in Chicago...</p>
<p>As was Kenny</p>
<p>As was Milken</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://investforkidschicago.org/past-speakers/">Invest for Kids Event Speakers list</a></p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>3rd biggest NEW position without a hedge falls to <strong>Hound Partners</strong></p>
<p>Couldn't dig up a lot here except this suspiciously convenient article about Kenny having a CURIOUSLY passive stake in TiVo along with Hound Partners, both in a stock that is "Not exactly widely followed"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150y1tj6mwz2w/citadels-curiously-passive-stake-in-tivo">https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150y1tj6mwz2w/citadels-curiously-passive-stake-in-tivo</a></p>
<p>On the OTHER HAND...</p>
<p>(This shit gets crazy)</p>
<p>Hound Partners was funded by a company called Tiger Management.</p>
<p>Tiger Management was founded by Julian Robertson</p>
<p>And... I really can't believe I am saying this but...</p>
<p>Kenny's Ex-wife, Anne Dias, Managed Money for both Kenny and Julian Robertson!!!!</p>
<p>WTF... THE ACTUAL FUCK</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-hedge-fund-veteran-has-contemplated-a-comeback-11559122201">https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-hedge-fund-veteran-has-contemplated-a-comeback-11559122201</a></p>
<p>I don't subscribe to WSJ, so only reading the headline... LMFAO</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Next up to get knocked down...</p>
<p><strong>Millenium Management Company</strong> Run by Israel Englander</p>
<p>Again... a suspiciously convenient example of Citadel and Millennium working in parallel with each other dumping FireEye Shares.</p>
<p>Reference (Warning... this is a motley fool article. Proceed with Skeptisism. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/26/these-billionaires-just-dumped-more-than-1-million.aspx">Link)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And yet again... Milken Global Conference 2010 with Milken, Kenny and Englander</p>
<p><a href="https://milkeninstitute.org/article/2010-milken-institute-global-conference-brings-world-leaders-los-angeles-foster-ideas">https://milkeninstitute.org/article/2010-milken-institute-global-conference-brings-world-leaders-los-angeles-foster-ideas</a></p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Apollo</strong> we already discussed.</p>
<p>But another cross-referencing showed up this article that has Marc Rowan (Apollo Founder), Kenny AND Julian Robertson all donating to Mitt Romney</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/02/01/billionaires-private-equity-ceos-give-big-to-romney-super-pac/?sh=5a6b52443568">https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/02/01/billionaires-private-equity-ceos-give-big-to-romney-super-pac/?sh=5a6b52443568</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And more form the Apollo leadership team heading out to hang out with Milken and Kenny in 2015: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/24/milken-time-wall-street-jets-west-for-davos-with-palm-trees.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/24/milken-time-wall-street-jets-west-for-davos-with-palm-trees.html</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>CSS LLC</strong> was a much tougher nut to crack.</p>
<p>Smaller company. Smaller position.</p>
<p>Finra does have a check on them though (<a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/45980">Ref: LINK</a>)</p>
<p>And it shows a single Director: Peter Anthony Ianello</p>
<p>After doing some solid Googling, it turns out he goes by Peter Ianello and is actually the founder of a different company... OCA Ventures.</p>
<p>I searched them for a 13F, but doesn't exist. (Ref: <a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc</a>)</p>
<p>But they are out of Chicago and both Kenny and Peter made it to the Chicago 100 list:</p>
<p><a href="http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html">http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html</a></p>
<p>A cross-reference with Milken shows that both guys are listed as business speakers for events... but that's meh...</p>
<p>That's all I could get for this one... but I am even more suspicious of these smaller funds.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Ionic Capital Management</strong> was a hard nut too</p>
<p>Founders were not listed in Linkedin, but I found <a href="https://www.globalvolatilitysummit.com/sponsor/ionic/">an article</a> listing 3 Co-Founders for the company:</p>
<p>Bart Baum</p>
<p>Adam Radosti</p>
<p>Daniel Stone</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>YET AGAIN... another article talking about Kenny and one of these companies making unusual plays.</p>
<p>Here they talk about Citadel And Ionic (Specifically just these 2) being bullish on a company called Verb. -- ONLY 4 hedge funds in total were trading this company!!!</p>
<p>Ken created the largest position and Ionic had the highest weighting.</p>
<p>And weirdly... in the article... it says both companies had $0 million as their position. lol. WTF.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://newsfortomorrow.com/index.php/2019/12/22/hedge-funds-have-never-been-this-bullish-on-verb-technology-company-inc-verb/">https://newsfortomorrow.com/index.php/2019/12/22/hedge-funds-have-never-been-this-bullish-on-verb-technology-company-inc-verb/</a></p>
<p>And here... Millenium, Citadel and Ionic all mentioned in a poorly timed position in LATAM Airlines</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/these-hedge-funds-couldnt-pick-a-worse-time-to-buy-latam-airlines-group-ltm-823467/">https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/these-hedge-funds-couldnt-pick-a-worse-time-to-buy-latam-airlines-group-ltm-823467/</a></p>
<p>Another unusual trade in NASDAQ:AVCT mentioning Citadel, Ionic and Millenium...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This list goes on... but I think you get the picture...</p>
<p>Been writing and researching this for a good few hours now, so I hope you find some entertainment in it.</p>
<p>I think the point is clear... and something we all knew all along.</p>
<p>There is 100% a Billionaire's Boys Club... but it's still fun to connect some of the dots!</p>
