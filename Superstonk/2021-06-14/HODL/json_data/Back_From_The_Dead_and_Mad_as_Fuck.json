    "selftext": "I didn't spend 6 months of my life, the last two riddled with death threats, shill buyout offers, and carpal tunnel, to watch this shit happen. After my account was hacked and deleted, I took a few days off, and this is what I come back to?\n\nYou're better than this. Anyone screaming back and forth about the importance or likelihood of a fake squeeze may not be a shill, but they certainly aren't being productive. You know the play. Buy and hold until you see a number you can't even fathom. Then keep holding til your heart gives out.\n\nCould they, against all rhyme or reason, try to pull out all the stops for one last bamboozle? Sure. Maybe. Who fucking cares? Such activity shouldn't even be triggering your price alerts. Straight up DOES. NOT. FUCKING. MATTER.\n\nI've seen some utterly absurd shit make it to the front page recently, but multiple posts about this takes the cake. At least some of the others had the decency to posit \"scary\" (albeit laughably erroneous) sentiments. You shouldn't waste an ounce of energy or concern about anything that doesn't materially change the dynamics of the MOASS, especially if it appears to be sowing division. If anything arises that does, you'll know very quickly. \n\nTLDR: I truly believe most apes know this by heart, but for anyone looking for a little extra confirmation bias before this jumps off, I'll always be your guy, no matter how many accounts it takes. You are the best of what this world has to offer. Live to up that. Ain't shit changed. Ape no fight ape. Buy and HODL. See you in interstellar space. \n\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\u2764\n\n-Broviet (check post history for verification from jsmar18 if wanted)",
