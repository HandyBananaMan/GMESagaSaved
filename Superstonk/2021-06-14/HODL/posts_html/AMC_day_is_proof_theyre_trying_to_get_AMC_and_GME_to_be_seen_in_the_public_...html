<p><em>Title edit</em>: it’s not proof - but by staying quiet and posting AMC friendly content, Superstonk is essentially allowing the mainstream media to group GME and AMC together - not just to unsuspecting investors - but to regulators as well. </p>
<p>I say this as respectfully and as politely as possible. </p>
<p>There is only one company here that’s doing a turnaround that’s going to be remembered in the business world for decades. </p>
<p>There’s only one company that has over 100% of the stock shorted. </p>
<p>There’s only one company speaking with their actions and not their words. </p>
<p>Invest in what you want, but this is a GME MOASS sub and the only discussions regarding AMC around here need to be pointing out that AMC is a distraction and strategic move by parties on the short side of GME in multiple ways.</p>
<p>There’s only one MOASS guys. There’s only ONE fucking MOASS. </p>
<p>This is not financial advice. I just like
The stock and I love fellow apes so want to do my part to spread the awareness as the truth has been slowly quieted.</p>
<p>Moderators need to also do a better job of following these rules themselves honestly as I’ve noticed one in particular continuing to post and talk about AMC here in a positive manner. </p>
<p>Stop supporting AMC here at Superstonk. If you think AMC is not a play by those on the wrong side of GME, then kindly keep that to yourself or discuss that on another subreddit and while here, please respect that GME is the only MOASS and that apes here will do what they can to spread awareness about how ever since January AMC has been their biggest play and that they’ve been trying to suppress that information and make it more accepted.</p>
