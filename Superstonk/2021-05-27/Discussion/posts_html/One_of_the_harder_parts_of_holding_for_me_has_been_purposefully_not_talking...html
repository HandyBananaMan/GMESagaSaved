<p>Although I don't believe it literally, I think there's some truth to be found in the saying "<em>If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans</em>."</p>
<p>I have a pretty small social circle (it's more of a dot) anyway so while my girlfriend and parents both know I've invested <em>some</em> money (read: YOLO'd) in the stock-market that's about as much as they know - my girlfriend saw my proxy voting materials and saw that they were for GameStop but she's still about as clueless to trading and the market as I was just a few months ago and actually basically still am.</p>
<p>So she's been having a really hard week at work and texted me today that she feels especially exhausted, overwhelmed, and is starting to hate her job (so, typical wage-slavery) - a job she <em>just</em> started that was supposed to be a huge improvement in nearly every area over her last one and related to the field she's interested in.</p>
<p>I so desperately want to be able to tell her to stop worrying, that we're going to have a fuckton of money soon but really I can't make that promise because I don't actually know that for certain, as convinced as I am personally. I'm <em>pretty sure</em> but I still can't make that leap to bring her hopes into my gamble.</p>
<p>For similar reasons I've never tried to convince anybody else I know to 'buy-in', although I can already predict some future "If you knew why didn't you let me know so I could be rich too?" situations and the answer is pretty simple - I don't want to be held personally responsible for someone potentially <em>losing</em> a lot of money, whether by paper-handing during a dip or selling too early on the way up and having to live with an insane amount of lost profit. As much as I love this community I can also see how from an outside perspective it initially seems to share some characteristics with very insular conspiratorial communities but for me personally, that doesn't matter because I like the stock and I like /r/Superstonk. </p>
<p>This particular 'conspiracy' just happens to be 100% true and yes, they do all say that but again, doesn't matter - time will almost always reveal what is true and what isn't.</p>
<p>I missed the buttcoin train years ago but I was lucky enough to not be too late for this rocket - I just hope as many other people catch a ride as they can <em>without</em> me having to convince them or proselytize. </p>
<p>To those of you who have talked your friends and family into Ape-hood good work - I know they will appreciate you later - it's still not something I can bring myself to do.</p>
