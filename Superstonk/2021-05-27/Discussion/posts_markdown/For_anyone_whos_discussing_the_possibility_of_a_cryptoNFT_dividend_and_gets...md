Patrick Byrne straight up went to war with them and did so very publicly. I've seen his strategy to combat shorts described as "scorched earth"

GME and RC have been the exact opposite. Silence towards the shorts = protection.

To put it simply:

"But everyone said that shorts covered and finra data says they covered, I don't see how we're responsible if everyone decided to lie" - probably future GME legal rep

Case thrown out of court. End of story.
