    "selftext": "Whenever the media talks about $GME or whenever Cramer has his breakdowns, they always refer to WallStreetBets still to this day. At first I thought that they might not know about r/GME and r/Superstonk, but then it got to me. They know about us, they know about every DD people write here. They study it and spend as much time here as we do. That right there, that's the reason they don't talk about this sub, ever. They know if they talk about it, people will come here interested in GME, see the real DD and all the fucked up shit them and the hedge funds do. Instead, they mention r/wallstreetbets because when a new to reddit person browses there, they see no DD instead it's all pumps and dumps, yolos into shit stocks and crypto. That's the picture they want to paint of us \"GME investors\". That we are doing this as a joke. That we have no real DD. That we are just dumb retail investors pumping GME like any other stock. That there is nothing special about GME. Just my thoughts, let me know what you think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, it's simple... Hold, Vote, Buy the dip.",
