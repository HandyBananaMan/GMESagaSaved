#Title: January ape here. I was scrolling through a chat with my friend, and came across this gem. This was the mood back in early Feb. This is how diamond hands were forged. There are millions of apes just like me. Good luck, hedgies! Note: I averaged down since then, I've been green for a while ðŸ˜Ž
