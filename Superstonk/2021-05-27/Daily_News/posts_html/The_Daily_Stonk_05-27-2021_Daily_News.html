<h1>They closed them in January? then how do you lose.... ooooooh</h1>
<p>In a recent Reuters article we can read that the short sellers have lost $754 million on Tuesday alone</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/gamestop-amc-short-sellers-lost-754-mln-after-tuesdays-rally-ortex-2021-05-26/">https://www.reuters.com/technology/gamestop-amc-short-sellers-lost-754-mln-after-tuesdays-rally-ortex-2021-05-26/</a></p>
<p>I keep hearing about they supposedly closed their position, we see strange behavior with the stock (FTD cycles) deep money options accumulating beyond the float, glitches showing up which we hypothesise may be shares which may be the number of shares which almost become FTD</p>
<p>This is far from over imo</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nliz0i/volume_glitches_surrounding_t21_dates_finra_rule/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Volume glitches</a></p>
<p>But seeing we had some good days I need to remind everyone of my favorite leather bound book series</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>it's not over till it's over, so until then expect everything can happen, the only thing we can know for sure is that the stock can go up, go down but one thing we know for a fact the line will go from left to to right.</p>
<p>But until its over, all we have to do is wait and hodl.</p>

<p>Let me do make it clear this is a cool thing that Ortex is reporting this but ortex also says gme only has a SI% of 17% (which would mean that for them to lose that much in the past 3 days the price would need to be 2k+) so take it with a grain of salt. all I know is that my college math professor would fail them.. hard.</p>

<h1>Reverse Repo... Again?</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Ok this one is something that makes me scratch my smooth brain quite a bit, the repo's are being used like... alot, and they keep increasing every day I remember somewhere last week or so these numbers where in the 300 now they're at 450 for yesterday.</p>
<p>let me explain with some links</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response_to_the_post_about_the_reverse_repo_limit/gze53hp/">https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nkmoi9/response_to_the_post_about_the_reverse_repo_limit/gze53hp/</a></p>
<p>u/Carb0n12 was a kind enough ape that went through all participants and listed them for us in the above link.</p>
<p>then  u/Believer109 made a thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nljwua/a_user_on_ddintogme_has_discovered_that_54_out_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a> but I'll quote his post here for ease of reading.</p>
<pre><code>All credit to /u/Carb0n12 and /u/BlindAsBalls for this post which is buried 
in a good DD about the FED's Reverse Repo process.

What does this mean???

Well, it means that there are 58 total institutions participating in the SOMA. 
There is a hard limit on the value of the SOMA ($7.3T), 
but an individual institutional limit of $80B each. 
Last night we hit $433B total and we know that there were 54 
Reverse Repos (again, out of 58 eligible institutions).

It is very very likely that one of the bigger banks or players 
on that list will hit their $80B limit very soon, 
perhaps as soon as this week or even today, 
meaning they would be forced to margin call HFs for the difference.

Not financial advice. 
All credit to the users who did the due diligence, 
just trying to bring attention to this. 
It's huge.

<p>Thanks for researching this guys, it seems that this in and of itself is... bad (for the economy) but it's not like we're facing hyperinflation or another crashing housing crisis right?</p>
<p>Welp... fuck</p>
<p>u/Sh0w3n made a thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nljmgp/hello_the_big_short_hello_michael_burry_over_21/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a></p>
<p>And take a wild fucking guess... Over 2.1 million mortgages are ''seriously delinquent'' (have not paid for more than 90 days) and in total 8.2 million mortgages are "behind" so we will most likely be facing another 2008... again, but seeing what we can now see (and know) of the stock market this will be a 2.0 and worse.</p>

<h1>He did what!?</h1>
<p>Ok first of all let me boilerplate this, I thought it was hilariously fucked up, but here is the thing, we can't do that kind of shit here, we are a stock board and even though we may have some juvenile or crude humor from time to time, this is where we have to draw the line.</p>
<p>Because if we don't what's next? someone taking a crap on their bosses desk? or worse.</p>
<p>I'm just saying it's all fun and games, but that stuff we gotta keep off of here.</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>

<p>emember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
