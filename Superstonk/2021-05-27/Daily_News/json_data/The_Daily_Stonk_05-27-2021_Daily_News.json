Over 2.1 million mortgages are ''seriously delinquent'' (have not paid for more than 90 days) and in total 8.2 million mortgages are \"behind\" so we will most likely be facing another 2008... again, but seeing what we can now see (and know) of the stock market this will be a 2.0 and worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13762xpsvm171.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af08c9c336bc46bc61e73942b7f6e9559d3f6bd4\n\n# He did what!?\n\nOk first of all let me boilerplate this, I thought it was hilariously fucked up, but here is the thing, we can't do that kind of shit here, we are a stock board and even though we may have some juvenile or crude humor from time to time, this is where we have to draw the line.\n\nBecause if we don't what's next? someone taking a crap on their bosses desk? or worse.\n\nI'm just saying it's all fun and games, but that stuff we gotta keep off of here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pru2uugwm171.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=27435aefb42f375d947337187be03d61961a0853\n\nOk so some last stuff before I go today, here are a couple of links which I believe might be interesting for you guys!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlr9n7/one\\_of\\_our\\_own\\_apes\\_called\\_this\\_run\\_up\\_a\\_week\\_ago/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlr9n7/one_of_our_own_apes_called_this_run_up_a_week_ago/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfodjb/there\\_was\\_never\\_a\\_wedge\\_wyckoff\\_accumulation/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfodjb/there_was_never_a_wedge_wyckoff_accumulation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlmlev/daym\\_it\\_feels\\_good\\_to\\_be\\_a\\_gme\\_hodler\\_in\\_times/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlmlev/daym_it_feels_good_to_be_a_gme_hodler_in_times/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fudmlucuwm171.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=c725b84568142f991da3b03d397182aefffdfd49\n\n# EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\nRemember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdonx5vwwm171.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b98ff9e8d9507bfc692528c22fcea8fd200974ba\n\nemember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.\n\nbackups:\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nOur Swedish apes can now votehttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm39ni/breaking\\_the\\_swedish\\_broker\\_avanza\\_will\\_finally/\n\nEdit 2:Cramer flipped.... again\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8dhFQKHRsk&ab\\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8dhFQKHRsk&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)\n\nnot sure what to make of this \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nEdit 3\n\n# ETORO WILL LET YOU VOTE!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm78os/etoro\\_vote\\_to\\_be\\_announced\\_tomorrow/gzmwjoh/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm78os/etoro_vote_to_be_announced_tomorrow/gzmwjoh/?context=3)\n\nMore news to come on this, also I can not personally verify this Email so.. grain of salt and all that.\n\nEdit 4\n\nHouse financial committee hearing, 27th noon\n\n[https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407756](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407756)",
