<p>30th March ,  Susquehanna  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-occ-2021-003/srocc2021003.htm">filed an opposition to AKA SR-OCC-2021-003</a> (AKA SR-OCC-2021-801) which pushed it out to 31st May based on <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-91483.pdf">an SEC notice yesterday</a></p>
<p>Seems that 003 is now approved, so both rules should roll out. I don't know when both rules will be effective.</p>
