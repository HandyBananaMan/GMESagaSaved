    "selftext": "TLDR: GME had the right conditions for a gamma squeeze today, but attention/ equity volume was diverted to AMC, which made the GME momentum slow down. However, the current higher price is being supported by other indicators, so hopefully we can build on it from here and be ready for the next opportunity.\n\nFor anyone that follows me, I track total market delta neutral/gamma neutral prices using options data to help with trading. The gamma neutral price  is the underlying price that creates a total market gamma of 0 across all GME options (all expiration dates). It is often associated with high volatility, and sometimes (especially in GME's case), it's associated with gamma squeezes.\n\nThe graph below summarizes the GME close price (green line), Delta Neutral price (blue line, underlying where a total market delta is 0), and the Gamma Neutral price (orange line). You can see that a gamma neutral spike (at $7,387.08) occurred yesterday for the first time since the 3/8 spike that started an 80% increase in a few days!\n\nYesterday, I said that this could signal the start of a gamma squeeze, and gave historical context.\n\nYesterday's post as a reference: [5/26 Gamma Neutral Analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlrtul/gamma_squeeze_could_be_coming_soon/)\n\nToday, we made solid gains in the price, but not a squeeze. The gamma neutral price also came back below the underlying price. As a reminder, anything I say here is not certain. This is all about probabilities, and the presence of a gamma neutral spike does not guarantee a gamma squeeze, but does make the chance of one happening much higher. The key ingredient is an increase in volume, which we can see with the current AMC squeeze (graph further below). The AMC volume has been increasing each day since Friday, in conjunction with a prolonged gamma neutral spike, which keeps the momentum for a gamma squeeze. Conversely, there was a GME gamma neutral spike present for today, but the GME volume decreased, and the momentum decreased.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME 1\\/4\\/2021 - 5\\/27\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/c10okn6ufq171.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=9df3cb0e1f21e991887bf8b557b692602a5faf76)\n\nThe good news here, is that the delta neutral price had a meaningful increase for the first time since March. The Delta Neutral price is important for creating a price floor, and acts as a resistance if the price drops. As you can see above, the price often stays above the delta neutral, with the gamma neutral creating some resistance between the underlying and delta neutral. The price often bounces off it if it gets too close, and if the price goes under the delta neutral, then pressure is created that shoots the price up when released (like what happened in February).\n\nThe fact that the delta neutral sharply increased today means that a new floor/resistance is being create to support this new higher price.\n\nPrior discussion on the GME underlying/delta neutral price interaction if interested:\n\n[5/10 Floor Analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9cutk/gme_bouncing_off_delta_neutral_price_today/)\n\n[5/11 Floor Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/na952e/gme_delta_neutral_price_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nAs a reference, here is a lead-up to the big January squeeze:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME 12\\/1\\/2020 - 1\\/26\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/1si7dsjzhq171.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=fddab7d3a61c00a55bac20678f948c527486de99)\n\nYou can see that the drop in the gamma neutral doesn't mean it's over, and the increase in the delta neutral helps support the new price levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a reference, and especially because GME/AMC are connected. Here's AMC's graph\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC 1\\/4\\/2021 - 5\\/27\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/uj4wsktsiq171.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9cf54594a10848798f00bc08f5c6f1d19bbb5af)\n\nAs you can see, AMC spikes a lot! It has also generally been in one long spike since 5/13, and fed by very high underlying volume. There was a small drop in the gamma neutral/volume between 5/19 - 5/21, before resuming again with progressively higher volume each day this week.\n\nI think this can help support the theory that the AMC squeeze is stealing volume from GME, which is delaying the GME squeeze.\n\nIf you're interested, here are a few of the other stocks I called out yesterday in the comments section. I'm not showing you this to draw your attention away from GME, but hopefully maybe to make you a believer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RCL 1\\/4\\/2021 - 5\\/27\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/nk0qs3i5kq171.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=939cd4adba8e2b8a8aa9a8e633e31f424856e8d7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FUBO 1\\/4\\/2021 - 5\\/27\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/cw7rwacbkq171.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc7761da0d5391c891541379b4838e399df41b8c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SFIX 1\\/4\\/2021 - 5\\/27\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/lff3i49mkq171.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=54bcca9ad47f3d126ef9fc092b601344b82bbab6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TLRY 1\\/4\\/2021 - 5\\/27\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/ithamkyqkq171.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=45502faf1856804b10a8fbedabbedd5db37b8afc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: GME had the right conditions for a gamma squeeze today, but volume was diverted to AMC, which made the GME momentum slow down.

Nothing in certain. It's just an indicator.",
