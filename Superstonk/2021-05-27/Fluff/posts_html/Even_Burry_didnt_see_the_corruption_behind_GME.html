<p>I bought into a fucking meme and now I'm hellbent on tearing down the fraudulent ponzi scheme that we call the stock market. I'm not going to pretend that I knew GME was the stock that would reform our financial system. I just wanted a quick 1-2 thousand bucks. I bought a few shares at 300+ in January. Then the price went down and I was way down on my investment. My stingy ass wouldn't fucking sell at a loss and the memes of WSB kept me going. More info trickled out, r/GME was born, and DDs started to uncover the tip of the corruption fossilized into our financial system and I knew the shorts hadn't covered. I trudged through February then the price jumped. I averaged my share price to 160 for XX shares and have only solidified my resolve further with each DD I read on r/superstonk. I hodl to end the GENERATIONS OF THEFT AND CORRUPTION and make them pay for 2008. Daddy Sam isn't coming to help the hedgies.</p>
<p>All of this to say that no one could have seen the societal impacts buying this stock has. DFV saw the deep fucking value of the stock, but I don't think even he knew just how deep the rabbit hole went. The reports I saw said Burry sold his shares before the squeeze. He didn't paperhand, he just didn't see value. None of us saw this coming and I feel like I won the lottery by finding out everything going down. I am so glad to see people drop their differences and come together. </p>
<p>This isn't financial advice and this sub doesn't represent any social movement. I'm just happy to see the side effects of liking a stock.</p>
