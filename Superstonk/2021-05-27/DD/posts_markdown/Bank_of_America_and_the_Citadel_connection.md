EDIT: This is just a theory, and I am not advocating anyone to do anything with their BofA accounts. Just some information I found and felt an obligation to share.

Good evening fellow Apes,

&#x200B;

Please forgive me as this is my first attempt at any DD. I welcome criticism and anything to support or disprove my hypothesis is also welcome.

Like most of you fellow apes when I first heard of the scandal that Credit Suisse and its substantial losses due to the margin call of the family office Archegos Capital Management, I thought to myself how the hell could that happen. This led to approximately 4 billion dollars in losses to Credit Suisse. It was at this moment I realized that someone has to be bankrolling Citadel.

Upon thinking about this long and hard I believe there is a bad smell coming from the direction of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.

1. My first bit of suspicion was when I saw this post on Superstonk regarding closures of some Bank of America locations. It was definitely sus. To my understanding, some of these locations were being boarded up due to the trial of George Floyd (RIP). This was very strange as some of these banks were being boarded up after the verdict of the trial, and it appeared no riots would happen.

2) The second piece of information that I came across that I thought might support my thesis was the recent hiring of Executive David Kim. David Kim was the head of equity client solutionsÂ at Bank of America, and was recently hired by Citadel Securities (link below). Now, this is speculative, but would it be possible that Kim has signed off on some terrible credit/increased risk, and jumped ship on some hidden backdoor deal?

3) I was digging through the 13f's on whalewisdom, and I found that Bank of America does hold decent-sized Put positions on AMC, and GME. As holding these put positions are a legal loophole way of holding a short position, I believe it's possible that they also took short positions against these meme stocks. As both organizations would benefit from colluding an aggressively short position, they could drive the price down and both mutually profit.

4) At this point I felt there is a lot of smoke coming from Bank of America, and that it was worth doing more digging. I decided to look into the  X-17A-5 annual financial report for Citadel securities that was recently filed with the SEC. ([https://sec.report/CIK/0001146184](https://sec.report/CIK/0001146184) ,filed Feb 25th 2021)

**BINGO**

&#x200B;

Conclusion: Given the evidence supported above, I believe that Bank of America has been put at significant risk of taking gigantic losses (or potentially defaulting). As Credit Suisse is trading at 3/4 of its February value, if Bank of America continued to loan/credit Citadel, I believe it is in serious trouble.

&#x200B;

I hope I'm on the right track. There are so many smart people on here, and if I can add even a little bit to this community that would be super fulfilling to me.

Ape out!

See you on the Moon!

Bonus: As it turns out last weekend the author of the following asserts they were told Bank of America's computers crashed on the weekend, and they could not withdraw more than $1000. Sounds like someone with liquidity issues.
