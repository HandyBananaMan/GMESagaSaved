Excuse the click-baity title. I don't know how accurate my conclusion is, but the parts are all there, sourced and listed below. The title is not misleading, alarmist yes, but for good reason.

On another note, I dedicate this write-up to u/sharkbaitlol. Last night before HOC 2 & 3 dropped, he posted a well-written post that he ultimately deleted due to mass reporting (I think) and harsh criticism; it was completely unjustified. He said he removed his post because it wasn't directly related to GME, but just like this post of mine, it actually was/is. Rule 5 says "Other stocks ... can be mentioned if related to Gamestop," and his and my post are related to Gamestop by nature of Citadel's involvement. 

**TL;DR** \- Adam Aron, Director/CEO/President of AMC, joined an SPAC as an independent director on May 6. A week later on the 12th, Citadel bought in to that same SPAC. As two weeks pass, up to today, [various](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc#topic-table-body) **institutions, including those who either shorted or worked with shorters on GME, bought shares, calls, and puts on AMC**. Many names we've seen before, like [in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/) "The industry players again GME," and other large Wall Street firms stacked up on AMC stock **before the run-up** this Monday.

# 1. The link between AMC and Citadel

On May 12 this year, Centricus Acquisition Corp. ("Centricus") was [purchased](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-071171/) (like 33.6% stake) by Kenneth Griffin ("Citadel") (Note: ownership is split between 7 entities, but they're all either directly controlled by or share partnership with Kenneth G., so going to just call them all "Citadel" unless the need to differentiate comes up). Centricus is an SPAC that, as of March 31, had $1,159,689 in cash not held in trust and available for "working capital purposes" (not making a point, just saying).

About a week before that on May 6, Adam Aron [was announced](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-063130/) to join as a director of Centricus, "appointed to serve on the audit committee, the nominating committee and the compensation committee." He was paid with [20,000 class B](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-063134/) shares along with a promise of future pay through Centricus' future merger (slight restrictions though).

[https:\/\/sec.report\/Document\/0001104659-21-064805\/](https://preview.redd.it/obrzp78ycq171.png?width=1465&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b3a552f88a51997d3172a009f5f4ae6f2eab0bf)

Beyond just SEC filings, [Centricus' website](https://www.centricusacquisitioncorp.com/team/default.aspx) lists Adam Aron as a director, so everyone knows they aren't trying to hide the facts (at least not all of them).

And that's the connection. It may appear shallow, but the situation is a bit absurd ‚Äî the CEO of a company under attack by Citadel is also in business with Citadel in an SPAC.

But... Is AMC under attack by short sellers? The narrative of "AMC being related to GME" and squeezing just like GME... Could it be a farce?

&#x200B;

# 2. AMC is not like GME, and it may NEVER squeeze

There are a vast amount of differences between the two companies, but I'll try to focus on the one most relevant to this post: Ryan Cohen ("RC") and Adam Aron ("AA").

RC has, since he first joined Gamestop, pushed to improve and revitalize the retailer. AA is scum.

[Long-time Wall Street bro sucks Jim Cramer's dick on Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/nyll68pktq171.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=9454b54ec843148500baca02616f5cd929923d35)

While AA has been using [his twitter](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/with_replies) to promote his company and retweet/tweet apes, trying to build a rapport with us little retail investors, RC [has been](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/with_replies) very quiet, only occasionally gracing us with memes and pictures. You won't find on RC's Twitter things you would on AA's. A cursory Google search shows some differences between the two:

[CNBC and Fox Business seem to like AA ü§î](https://preview.redd.it/q7bjshwsvq171.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=65639e30a39c9ee6e14392c39edb2db9cf7e385f)

But that's all pretty obvious right? RC is a great guy while AA is a Wall Street guy. It's been known for a long while especially on Superstonk where I frequent.

But how did I get to the conclusion that AMC might never squeeze? Fine I'll get to the point...

Gamestop filed a [prospectus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospectus.asp) where they would [dilute their shares](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-105564/) by 20.22% (70.77M shares / 3.5M new stock) or up to a value of $1 billion. The broker they used was called Jefferies LLC.

AMC filed their own prospectus, with plans to [dilute their shares](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-055711/) by 12.19% (524.17M shares / 43M). They chose Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as their brokers. Two cool Wall Street firms. /s

But that's not all AMC did. They also tried this:

 "In  addition, on January¬†27, 2021, our **board of directors approved an  amendment to our certificate of incorporation** to **increase the total  number of shares of Class¬†A common stock** the Company shall have the  **authority to issue by 500,000,000 shares** to a total of 1,024,173,073  shares of Class¬†A common stock (the ‚ÄúCharter Amendment‚Äù).  The **Charter Amendment was subject to the approval of at least a  majority of the capital stock entitled to vote** and we submitted the  Charter Amendment to our stockholders for approval at our annual meeting  of stockholders. However, on April 27, 2021, our board of directors  determined not to seek stockholder approval of the Charter Amendment and  withdrew such proposal from stockholder consideration at our annual  meeting of stockholders. **Notwithstanding the foregoing, our board of  directors reserves the right to propose an amendment to our certificate  of incorporation to increase the authorized shares at any point in the  future**. If any such amendment to our certificate of incorporation is  approved by our stockholders in the future, **we may issue a substantial  number of shares relative to the number of shares currently authorized  by our certificate of incorporation. These future issuances may be  significantly dilutive to your investment and result in a decline in the  market price of our Class¬†A common stock**. This  risk of future dilution must be weighed against the risk that our  stockholders fail to approve an increase in our authorized number of  shares of Class¬†A common stock."

They tried to covertly slip through a **share dilution of \~100%** \- then they changed their minds, but not without assuring their stock holders that **they'd do it later** ([same as last link](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-055711/)). Good thing shareholders have a say in if and when they could do such a thing.

But there's more! The board at AMC [changed their bylaws](https://sec.report/Document/0001411579-21-000038/) on May 4th (two days before their CEO joined that SPAC):

" On May 4, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an  amendment to Article II, Section 6 of the Company‚Äôs Bylaws to reduce the  number of shares present at meeting of stockholders necessary to  constitute a quorum to conduct business from a majority of issued and  outstanding shares to **one-third (1/3) of issued and outstanding shares**."

So the next time they want to fuck over their shareholders by releasing a mass amount of stock, **only 1/3 of the majority will be needed**. And two days before AA joins an SPAC / eight days before Citadel buys into that same SPAC... That timing is suspect. Like too suspect to just brush it off.

There's [another part](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-055680/#tDES) I'm unsure about if I'm reading this right:

"Preferred Stock

Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the AMC  Board to **issue from time to time up to an aggregate of 50,000,000  shares of preferred stock** in one or more series without further stockholder approval. **The AMC Board is authorized, without  further stockholder approval, to fix or alter the designations,  preferences, rights and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each such series thereof, including** the  dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, **terms  of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price** or prices, liquidation preferences and **the number of  shares constituting any series or designations of such series**."

How long does "time to time" mean? And that last sentence, can they just redeem/make preferred stock common A stock if they want? I don't know, I'm smooth brained.

And one more thing in the [same filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-055680/#tSEL) as last:

[Hmm, I guess AMC doesn't mind their stock getting further shorted?](https://preview.redd.it/vwz3lso1cr171.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=13fae3e7bac3757780fe5b1e0c2b7a1df85f14b1)

The formatting was balls so used a screenshot but these lines irk me the most:

" In addition, **we** or the selling stockholders **may  enter into derivative or hedging transactions with third parties, or  sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions**. In connection with such a  transaction, **the third parties may sell securities covered by and  pursuant to this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement or pricing supplement**, as the case may be. If so, **the third  party may use securities borrowed from us or the selling stockholders or  others to settle such sales and may use securities received from us or selling stockholders to close out any related short  positions**. For example, we and the selling stockholders may: enter into transactions with a broker-dealer or  affiliate thereof in connection with which such broker-dealer or  affiliate will engage in short sales of the Class¬†A common stock pursuant to this prospectus, in which case such **broker-dealer or  affiliate may use shares of Class¬†A common stock received from us** or  selling stockholders **to close out its short positions; sell Class¬†A common stock short and re-deliver such shares to close out the short positions**; "

Why would AMC, if it's under attack by malevolent shorters, think it a good idea to loan or sell new stock to short sellers? Writing this into their prospectus seems like a really, really bad idea.

**Either long-time Wall Street CEO AA and his board are a bunch of real idiots or they are working with short sellers**. There's no reason for this kind of language in their prospectus if neither was true. The company would not tell shareholders of how they might help short sellers cover their position unless it was either planned or expected.

&#x200B;

# 3. But why would AMC work with short sellers? Short interest proves they are under short attacks.

Read HOC 2 + 3. Short interest proves nothing.

&#x200B;

# 4. Where's the benefit in working with Citadel?

Money. AA and his board of dickbags would profit big if apes bought into AMC and held until June 2nd. The narrative of "hodl until the record date!" gives them and all the institutions buying in (or having bought in early) days to **pump and dump the stock**. I'm not a betting man (all my money is in GME) but if I had to make a prediction, I'd say there'll be some major dumping of AMC next week.

&#x200B;

# 5. You're a shill. You just want GME to moon and not us AMC apes

No, I just liked u/sharkbaitlol's post a lot. It also sent me down a 10+ hour rabbit hole so fuck you for that sharkbait.

But anyways, I finally got an answer to my question: what tf is Citadel doing? I knew they had to be planning something big because I know I wouldn't just do nothing if I were in their position.

Even if I'm connecting dots and drawing conclusions and tinfoil etc, I'm not assuming everything. The evidence is all there to find, including...

&#x200B;

# 6. Evidence of insider trading? Maybe...

To top it all off, I believe that either word was put out or slipped out of what was going to happen (AMC pump and dump). I don't have clear-cut evidence of this, but there's a pattern you can see right off [fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/amc):

[Lotta green](https://preview.redd.it/de26ydj5jr171.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba76071d6c133aea20ed03b1a51437a25147d47)

Starting May 17, hedgies and banks stopped selling AMC (for the most part). Instead they started buying, by a lot. But before that...

Remember what happened on May 12? That's when Citadel bought into the SPAC Centricus.

[Event May 12, filed after May 24](https://preview.redd.it/d5vcqf00kr171.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=f954145ed14d72a89221ba3d54743b3e5ae6c459)

On fintel, it looks more or less normal up until May 17, a day where 14 closed their positions. The last to close their position was on the 18th. Beyond that, all buys/opening new positions. I don't know about increases, but the dates are just too much to be coincidence:

**May 4** \- AMC's changed voting majority to 1/3 for a quorum for no reason.

**May 6** \- AMC's CEO joins an SPAC for seemingly no reason.

**May 12** \- Citadel buys into that same SPAC.

**May 18** \- last time an institution closed a position on AMC (although 17th was more or less the last normal date).

**May 21** \- Citadel reports a 750k share position in AMC.

**May 24** \- price runs up on GME and AMC, GME because of T+35 and AMC for no reason.

**June 2** \- day you need AMC shares to vote (don't even understand why people care, but the narrative to hold until this day has been spread out and about).

&#x200B;

# 7. What do I think is going to happen?

Not sure, but for weeks to months now AMC has been spread as a stock that's going to squeeze, despite no DD or evidence of that. I've heard people say it's the same hedgies shorting both, but are they really? I'd love to see why people think that and I hope it's not just cause they're following the crowd, a crowd which is choosing a cheaper alternative to GME (which isn't an alternative at all).

If I were to put these pieces together though and think up a nightmare scenario, I'd say this:

Adam Aron, CEO of AMC, is a Wall Street bro, using his connections to make bank, colluding with short sellers like Citadel to pump his stock, spread their narrative, and initiate what looks like a short squeeze on AMC, while GME either trades sideways or is attacked down. Come June 2nd or near, AMC stock will plummet as the shorters sell or exercise their calls, then the board will vote for introducing 1 billion new shares. They'll give or sell it to the shorters so they could stop being short while flooding the market with shares. AMC never squeezes, apes lose big while hedgies win big. Then the hedgies use their newly acquired gains to short attack GME to as low as it can go.

Following this, Citadel still squeezes cause of RC's GMEcoin play, but Wall Street uses Citadel's collapse and the pump and dump scheme to try to regulate retailers, not themselves, as we need protection from bad actors like Citadel (if they're the only fall guy) and the only way to protect them is to have them need to use brokers not apps to trade.

But who knows.

&#x200B;

# 8. In conclusion...

I don't think AMC is a distraction anymore. I think it used to be one, but AA turned around and is working with Wall Street to make it a trap. Those complicit with AA want to not only rob retailers, they also want to cause disillusionment in apes and make people think GME can't squeeze. I think before the squeeze comes, a large amount of institutions will buy into GME so when the MOASS happens it'll be mainly the already rich who profit.

And I don't know what to do about this beyond make this post. Hope it was helpful since I spent so long writing and researching. Don't know how bad the fallout would be if I'm even a quarter right, but the very least I could do is some reading and teaching. Superstonk's been a blessing in a year and a half of shit, so I want to contribute to the betterment like the rest are.

Now I'm going to tag some mods and say: I think sharkbaitlol should be re-modded. He wasn't spreading FUD or breaking rules, and he's an alright guy I think. He had a good point and he was unfairly attacked yesterday. Citadel and their going-ons is always relevant to GME until they fall.
