<p>As you probably already know, we have hardly any opportunities to vote in Europe. Now there was in the proxy documents of Game Stop on page 10 point 7 the hint regarding Broker Non-Vote. <strong>We urgently need a feedback from Mr. Carl Hagberg</strong>. My Apebro /u/Pristine_Physics_857 has already asked the question to Mr. Carl Hagberg, but we need more upvotes here.</p>

<p>Euroapes would be happy if you upvote the question diligently. I am sure you are also very interested in the fact that our shares can finally be counted and that we also have a decisive weighting. Even if we cannot vote directly, the recording of the number of shares is the decisive factor for all of us.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. Apes together strong.</p>
