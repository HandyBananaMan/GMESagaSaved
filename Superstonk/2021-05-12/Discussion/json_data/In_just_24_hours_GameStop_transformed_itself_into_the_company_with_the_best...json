Whether it\u2019s him, DFV, or somebody else behind the wheel on the social platforms they are absolutely killing it and giving the people what they want. I\u2019ve never seen brand interaction like this before, closest comparison would be Wendy\u2019s but this is better because it\u2019s not snarky really it\u2019s just fun and it\u2019s engaging fans in one on one convos. Very impressed over here.",
