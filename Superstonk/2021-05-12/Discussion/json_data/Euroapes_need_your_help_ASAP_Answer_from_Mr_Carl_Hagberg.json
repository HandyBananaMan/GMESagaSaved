My Apebro /u/Pristine_Physics_857 has already asked the question to Mr. Carl Hagberg, but we need more upvotes here.\n\nLink:  [**https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n8qq8v/official\\_ama\\_carl\\_hagberg\\_retail\\_shareholder/gxl3ogg/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf&context=3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n8qq8v/official_ama_carl_hagberg_retail_shareholder/gxl3ogg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEuroapes would be happy if you upvote the question diligently. I am sure you are also very interested in the fact that our shares can finally be counted and that we also have a decisive weighting. Even if we cannot vote directly, the recording of the number of shares is the decisive factor for all of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you very much. Apes together strong.",
