Watching the transformation in all its facets in real time has been nothing short of astounding. Cohen moves fast and decisively doesn’t he? Whether it’s him, DFV, or somebody else behind the wheel on the social platforms they are absolutely killing it and giving the people what they want. I’ve never seen brand interaction like this before, closest comparison would be Wendy’s but this is better because it’s not snarky really it’s just fun and it’s engaging fans in one on one convos. Very impressed over here.
