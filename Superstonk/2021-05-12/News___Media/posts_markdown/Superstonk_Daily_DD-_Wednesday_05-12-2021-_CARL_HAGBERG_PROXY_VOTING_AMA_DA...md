# The Tweet Heard Round the World

[Mission Control to Major Gamestop. Do you read me? HODL.](https://preview.redd.it/jbj5axgezky61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9cc9dede70692e40f6ea2419cbf0efa046bac87)

So Gamestop decided to be cryptic af while also jacking all of the tits yesterday when they tweeted this pic with the caption "**Been away for the past few months. What did I miss**?"

# UM EXCUSE ME I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS!! 🙋‍♀️

Let's look at the pic a little closer shall we? 🧐

Some people have pointed out that this is an [old original Carlsberg Beer advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnrq-V39B6M). And that is true.

As you can see, the astronaut is both holding the Carlsberg beer in their hand, and resting their feet on a Carlsberg cooler.

But let's think about whether this was intentional... ok. They *didn't* edit out the original Carlsberg, yet they edited *in* the GS on the sleeve? So it *is* edited, which logically tells me they left the Carlsberg there for a reason....

AND TODAY IS THE **CARL** HAG**BERG** AMA.....

# 🚨GAMESTOP KNOWS ALL ABOUT CARL HAGBERG, HE IS THE EXPERT THEY CALL AND HIRE TO OFFICIALLY EXAMINE THE VOTES IF THEY'RE FUCKY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?! GME CORPORATE ALREADY KNOWS CARL WAY BEFORE THIS AMA!!!!!🚨

From Carl Hagberg's bio:

["He is also considered to be a leading expert on the proxy voting process and has served as Independent Inspector of Election, both in contested and uncontested situations, at over 300 annual and special meetings of shareholders."](https://optimizeronline.com/about/)

When a corporate election uncovers something wonky, like **OVERVOTING**, they call experts.

# LIKE THE LEADING EXPERT IN THE FIELD, [CARL HAGBERG!](https://optimizeronline.com/about/)

[**It has also been pointed out that Carlsberg (the Beer) has been- and continues to be- in the middle of a share buyback.**](https://tools.euroland.com/tools/Pressreleases/GetPressRelease/?ID=3909116&lang=en-GB&companycode=dk-cbg&v=dk-cbg_new)

If that were to happen with GME, that would be more than checkmate for Hedgies, although that doesn't make a whole lot of sense considering they just unloaded a bunch of shares to clear debt. But maybe they are just getting back on the rocket with us **BECAUSE THE PRICE IS A LIE!!!** 🚀

Now do you see why it's not just a bunch of tin foil conspiracy? **DO YOU SEE IT?** (Laughs maniacally)

[Ground Control to Major GME- DO WE HAVE BLASTOFF?!?!?!](https://preview.redd.it/6w7n8qeomly61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a29e0f288d76f33e57514c99e745af4448529ff)

&#x200B;

# [And don't forget that yesterday was the first day that Gamestop Corp was actually able to see live poll results from the proxy voting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxwfyt/proxy_voting_dd_how_the_count_works_and_timeline/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) THEY KNOW!!!

# 📢📢Clear your schedule for today at 4pm Eastern- No, SERIOUSLY YOU CAN'T MISS THIS AMA 📢📢

Remember how much the Dr. T AMA changed the game for us? Well the world is taking us seriously. And leading experts are now willing to come and educate this community, free of charge, because **THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING NAKED SHORT SELLING FOR YEARS AND SO FAR NO ONE HAS LISTENED!!**

We are the pitchfork army of individual investors that Dr. T, Carl Hagberg, Dave Lauer, and many others, have been waiting to come and grab Wall Street by the absolute BALLS like we have, to where this issue can't be ignored any more.

You know what makes us different?

**THIS COMMUNITY!!**

**YOU APES!!**

[**If you watched the old Wall Street Conspiracy documentary LIKE I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU TO**](https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU) (I can still give out poopoo flairs for not watching, y'know 👀) then you know there have been apes for decades. Apes just like us. Apes fighting to stop corruption and expose the criminal financial system. But you notice something in that documentary about the apes?

**THEY DIDN'T HAVE REDDIT!!**

The apes in that documentary are just an earlier generation of us, that lacked the platform we have. Sure, they had an online group, but it was moderated by A SINGLE MOD. And it wasn't a huge community like ours. They had to physically pound the pavement to get the word out. Whereas they stood on the street corner of Wall Street with a bull horn, **WE HAVE AMAs ON YOUTUBE. 📢📢📢📢📢 We are doing this not only for this community, but for every ape before us who has tried to get someone's attention about the** [**Naked, Short, and Greedy**](https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy)**.**

&#x200B;

# Here's a comment from u/Atobitt:

&#x200B;

*"Honestly, I don't see how the vote can be low.*

*I've talked with Carl and we both agree there's no way for hedge funds to get out of a 140% short position. The highest daily volume in Jan was on 1/22 with 197 million shares traded. Its much harder to explain that figure as legitimate shares being traded, because the entire company would have to exchange almost every share 3 times. The way hedge funds counter a dramatic and rapid increase in stock price is through shorting, and the pattern in GME and other heavily shorted stocks looks exactly like that. It's more likely that hedge funds were naked shorting millions of shares to suppress the price, which still went up until Robinhood halted retail buying.*

*After that, their only option to get the situation under control was to cause a panic sell and bankrupt the company. If they couldn't tank the company and convince people to sell their positions, it would allow the buyer of those phantom shares to vote at the annual shareholder meeting. We saw flash crashes, short selling on circuit breaker events, and additional short selling when hedge funds were supposedly covering.. It started to look like they were desperate, which we knew they were.*

*So.... By hodling through these events and voting at the meeting, we now have the most transparent way to illustrate the effects of their market f\*uckery.*

*I think people (including myself) are going to be surprised by the number of votes cast this year. People like Carl Hagberg serve as proxy election specialists and audit the process to ensure everything checks out. He is considered one of the country's leading authorities on annual meeting matters. When the situations described above start to show up, its damned-near impossible to explain it any other way.*

*Hedgies R F\*cked*

# Meet Finley and Quinn Mulligan- The brothers behind the Apes Together Strong Documentary

The one told by apes, for apes.

# [This is pasted from the OP by](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9x3qw/documentary_update_its_all_about_the_apes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) u/albanak

🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍-- **INTRO** \-- 🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧

My name is Finley Mulligan ([u/albanak](https://www.reddit.com/u/albanak/)), my brother is Quinn Mulligan ([u/cyclopsQHM](https://www.reddit.com/u/cyclopsQHM/)). We are apes.

We've been hodling since early Jan, joined the exodus to [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) and eventually migrated with the first wave of settlers at [r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) — we are not outsiders, we want to make sure this story is told right and from within.

🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍-- **BACKGROUND** \-- 🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍

We got sick of seeing "retail" investors being portrayed like shit by the mainstream media.

We couldn't stand seeing the narrative build that the current untenable state of our markets is somehow *our fault* — meanwhile, everyone turns a blind eye to the corruption, illegal practices, and blatant manipulation being practiced by the "institutions" lining the pockets of the asshats condemning us.

Then the hulu doc came out and we kind of hit a limit. SO. I posted a simple question — "**Who wants a REAL documentary about what's happening with the squeeze**?" and the response was overwhelmingly positive — you had some key points of guidance:

* The story isn't done 'til the squeeze has squozen
* Ask the questions no one's asking (naked short selling, FTDs, etc)
* Make sure to features the community as much as possible
* Tell the truth even if the truth hurts
* Fuck off, we just like the stock (fair enough)

[**We took those tenets to heart and posted THIS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgoo4a/update_question_who_wants_a_real_documentary/)**.**

This story isn't finished.

It feels like a war of attrition at times but with new rules, SEC head, and the simple fact that time is on our side we believe that we will soon see an end to this saga.

This last act is still unfolding and we won’t be telling an unfinished story — apes are very clear that this film shouldn’t finish until the squeeze has squozen and we want to respect that.

We’ll be including the community throughout the creation of the film. Offering to show rough cuts, consulting when we’re stuck or need fresh eyes. We believe very much that community engagement is vital to being able to call this a film for apes by apes.

# DTCC Liquidity Test (yes, again)

[I can haz fundz?](https://preview.redd.it/xr9yu0vntly61.jpg?width=726&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2b83a20214bf0ce00097c72d1268cee88974c1a)

[**So the DTCC is having a liquidity test tomorrow, May 13th.**](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-002.pdf)

[What the hell is a liquidity test anyway?](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/Clearing-Services/FICC/CCLF-Annual-Test-Reference-Doc.pdf)

Well... This doesn't effect anything in the market in real time, it is merely a computer simulation test meant to test the liquidity of the market when the new rules get implemented (think 002). It's odd that they would do a test that they *just* did in April, and they usually do **ANNUALLY,** to be doing it *again* just a **MONTH LATER**. And liquidity tests do require... liquidity... in order to pass them. So you *miiiiiight* need to sell a few things to rack up those liquid assets.....

## [Stocks just suffered the worst bout of concentrated selling pressure in history i.e. MASS SELLOFF YESTERDAY](https://twitter.com/sentimentrader/status/1392110819568095234?s=20)

[Like takin aaaaall your valuables to the pawn shop right before bills come due](https://preview.redd.it/bk7mvyk3oly61.png?width=1373&format=png&auto=webp&s=70d8901da1e06a287b9298bc1ff40ecab723ab8a)

So I can't find anything to really verify this tweet besides the tweet itself, but I will say, as u/bye_triangle pointed out, that u/deepfuckingvalue follows this account on his twitter, and I know that guy doesn't follow bogus sources. So I'm just saying take this was a liiiiittle grain of salt. But mods think this checks out. ✅

# 👀 New Mod-Only Post Flairs 👀

After an influx of requests for tighter moderation in the sub and much deliberation amongst the mod team, we decided it would be best to instead of removing questionable/unverified/contended posts, we would instead create some Mod-only use post flairs that we can assign when posts have been determined to be unverified, or totally debunked.

So we decided that removing some posts was too much, and instead made a mod-only flair

# ⚠Inconclusive⚠

so we can mark posts that seem suspect, inconclusive, or are potential FUD. OP can then revise their post with accurate info to have flair updated. Additionally, you apes can still see the post, and it's very transparent in what we are considering to be suspicious or potential FUD without removing it. You can then discuss for or against a flair change in the comments;

We also added the

# 🚨Debunked🚨

flair to the mod-only flair lineup. Please note, we will still remove posts that blatantly break rules; but this way we can manage in a transparent way whether to be cautious or not with posts.

It's a seriously thin line to toe between democracy and something else. We are a pretty liberal mod team and we try to let the apes decide what we read in the jungle, but we also realize the weight and responsibility we have to provide accurate information to the community. Hopefully this satisfies both sides of the dilemma.

We're all just a bunch of smooth brained apes tryin' to get a couple wrinkles here. ✌
