And that is true.\n\nAs you can see, the astronaut is both holding the Carlsberg beer in their hand, and resting their feet on a Carlsberg cooler.\n\nBut let's think about whether this was intentional... ok. They *didn't* edit out the original Carlsberg, yet they edited *in* the GS on the sleeve? So it *is* edited, which logically tells me they left the Carlsberg there for a reason....\n\nAND TODAY IS THE **CARL** HAG**BERG** AMA.....\n\n# \ud83d\udea8GAMESTOP KNOWS ALL ABOUT CARL HAGBERG, HE IS THE EXPERT THEY CALL AND HIRE TO OFFICIALLY EXAMINE THE VOTES IF THEY'RE FUCKY.

The highest daily volume in Jan was on 1/22 with 197 million shares traded. Its much harder to explain that figure as legitimate shares being traded, because the entire company would have to exchange almost every share 3 times. The way hedge funds counter a dramatic and rapid increase in stock price is through shorting, and the pattern in GME and other heavily shorted stocks looks exactly like that. It's more likely that hedge funds were naked shorting millions of shares to suppress the price, which still went up until Robinhood halted retail buying.*\n\n*After that, their only option to get the situation under control was to cause a panic sell and bankrupt the company. If they couldn't tank the company and convince people to sell their positions, it would allow the buyer of those phantom shares to vote at the annual shareholder meeting. We saw flash crashes, short selling on circuit breaker events, and additional short selling when hedge funds were supposedly covering.. It started to look like they were desperate, which we knew they were.*\n\n*So.... By hodling through these events and voting at the meeting, we now have the most transparent way to illustrate the effects of their market f\\*uckery.*\n\n*I think people (including myself) are going to be surprised by the number of votes cast this year. People like Carl Hagberg serve as proxy election specialists and audit the process to ensure everything checks out. He is considered one of the country's leading authorities on annual meeting matters. When the situations described above start to show up, its damned-near impossible to explain it any other way.*\n\n*Hedgies R F\\*cked*\n\n\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udc50\"    - u/atobitt, describing how Hedgies r fukd\n\nAlso...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g97nzfg35my61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=2705c87a199719ad0ea524d523061388555145f7\n\n# \u2705VOTE YOUR SHARES AND GET YOUR FLAIRS!\u2705\n\n**Drop a comment below with !apevote! to get your special vote flair**\n\nEUROAPES GOT A FLAIR!!

SO. I posted a simple question \u2014 \"**Who wants a REAL documentary about what's happening with the squeeze**?\" and the response was overwhelmingly positive \u2014 you had some key points of guidance:\n\n* The story isn't done 'til the squeeze has squozen\n* Ask the questions no one's asking (naked short selling, FTDs, etc)\n* Make sure to features the community as much as possible\n* Tell the truth even if the truth hurts\n* Fuck off, we just like the stock (fair enough)\n\n[**We took those tenets to heart and posted THIS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgoo4a/update_question_who_wants_a_real_documentary/)**.**\n\nThis story isn't finished.\n\nIt feels like a war of attrition at times but with new rules, SEC head, and the simple fact that time is on our side we believe that we will soon see an end to this saga.\n\nThis last act is still unfolding and we won\u2019t be telling an unfinished story \u2014\u00a0apes are very clear that this film shouldn\u2019t finish until the squeeze has squozen and we want to respect that.\n\nWe\u2019ll be including the community throughout the creation of the film.

OP can then revise their post with accurate info to have flair updated. Additionally, you apes can still see the post, and it's very transparent in what we are considering to be suspicious or potential FUD without removing it. You can then discuss for or against a flair change in the comments;\n\nWe also added the\n\n# \ud83d\udea8Debunked\ud83d\udea8\n\nflair to the mod-only flair lineup. Please note, we will still remove posts that blatantly break rules; but this way we can manage in a transparent way whether to be cautious or not with posts.\n\nIt's a seriously thin line to toe between democracy and something else. We are a pretty liberal mod team and we try to let the apes decide what we read in the jungle, but we also realize the weight and responsibility we have to provide accurate information to the community. Hopefully this satisfies both sides of the dilemma.\n\n[smooth brain](https://preview.redd.it/1u24b08ttly61.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba2f11a9317f8028adb35e9571739fc546b1b700)\n\nWe're all just a bunch of smooth brained apes tryin' to get a couple wrinkles here. \u270c\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# \ud83d\udce2\ud83d\udce6Don't Forget about the International Giveaway Contest!\ud83d\udce2\ud83d\udce6\n\n3 lucky apes outside the USA will receive a Gamestop Limited Edition Bananya Cat, complete with red headband!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl6szt023ly61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ca95e0cb395a7d36d0338dd32cf04ff1e34e23\n\n# \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80SHOW ME THE MEMES!! \ud83d\udc40\n\n**I want you to show me your best GME meme**!!!
