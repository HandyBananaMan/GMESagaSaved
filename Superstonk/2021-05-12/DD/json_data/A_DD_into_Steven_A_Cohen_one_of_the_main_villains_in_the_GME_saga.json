If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.*** **-Sun Tzu**\n\n***Know your enemy.*** **-Zack de la Rocha**\n\nAs someone who has been hodling for many months and paying daily visits (truthfully, multiple daily visits) to the various subs we Apes have called home along the way, I have noticed a shift in focus.\n\nIt is apparent that Gabe \u201cI\u2019m willing to stoop so low that I\u2019ll lie about anti-Semitic comments in an attempt to garner sympathy\u201d Plotkin and his Melvin \u201cwe lost all of our\u201d Capital, once the main villains in this story, have now been relegated to a side character role.\n\nApes\u2019 ire has mostly been directed at Ken \u201cI have no soul\u201d Griffin and his Shitadel Insecurities as of late, and rightfully so given Cuck Ken\u2019s role in the GME saga and Shitadel\u2019s propensity to engage in illegal, unethical practices that put the entire economy at risk.\n\nBut there\u2019s another character who seems to largely remain out of the spotlight, despite the fact that he has also played an integral part in all this. Apes likely recall that when Melvin received their $2.75 billion cash infusion back in January (to be clear, it **wasn\u2019t** a bailout \\*wink wink\\*), that money came from Shitadel **AND** Point72, a hedge fund founded in 2014 by the notorious investor and hedge fund manager Steve Cohen.\n\n[Reprobate](https://preview.redd.it/yqaend6t6ry61.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=209b50df0928d88472a70d11bc3ddf36ab3ddf18)\n\nSteven A. Cohen is probably best known for being majority owner of the New York Mets, purchasing a 95% stake in the team on October 30, 2020 for a cool $2.475 billion. To some Apes he is probably better known as the hedge fund billionaire douchebag who sent this tweet out into the ether, taunting retail investors after trading was illegally halted on January 28.\n\n[Taunting after blatantly cheating? Classy. ](https://preview.redd.it/woclcgjz6ry61.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=671e642b2e24acfbd56d43fc3f6641c03b263a09)\n\nApes no doubt member that trading was halted because of the \u201crecent volatility\u201d occurring at that time, and brokers like Robbinghood understood that it was as \u201cimportant as ever that we help customers stay informed,\u201d so amid that volatility they made \u201ca risk-management decision\u201d and restricted the buying of multiple securities, including GME. Or was it because of increased liquidity requirements?\n\nMaybe their servers went down? No wait, that was why trading cryptocurrencies was halted on ~~two~~ three different occasions, right? Not anything to do with GME.\n\nSorry, I\u2019m having a hard time keeping all the \u201cfacts\u201d straight in my lissencephalic brain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97xic6t27ry61.jpg?width=638&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b51ef34eb0a15608256d637e2fb890370137afb0\n\nAnd after being criticized by none other than Mr. Paper Portnoy himself:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jlyr0hg47ry61.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e856e446a9c577f9739b286b28799652e65fd10\n\nSee, the poor guy is just trying to make a living like the rest of us.\n\nJust like any one of us he owns a 35,000 square foot home with a full-size indoor basketball court, a swimming pool \u201cenclosed in a glass pleasure dome,\u201d a 6,734-square-foot ice-skating rink, and a two-hole golf course, plus the neighboring $5 million dollar home in case those pesky in-laws come to visit the compound.\n\n[One of Steve's many humble properties.](https://preview.redd.it/zncl67j57ry61.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94ce67b46c5fe0e5d98e6a8965ad7592993149a3)\n\nI\u2019m sure all of us have probably purchased a $62.5 million 10,000 square foot East Hampton mansion only to tear it down a mere THREE YEARS LATER to build a newer, BETTER house in its place, no? You don\u2019t want one of your many homes to be sub-par, do you?\n\nAnd Apes like art, right? I\u2019m a fan of Banksy, myself.\n\n[Judgement day cometh...](https://preview.redd.it/26eur7jb7ry61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7fa82d2e9175a92d9e89beb90c7940433c87450)\n\nCohen\u2019s modest art collection is valued at more than $1 billion and includes such items as an $8 million 14-foot shark preserved in formaldehyde, otherwise known as Damien Hirst\u2019s *The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living*, and Picasso\u2019s *Le R\u00eave*, purchased for a cool $155 million. At the time it was the most a U.S. collector had ever paid for artwork, but that record was broken when Willem de Kooning's *Interchange* was purchased for around $300 million in September 2015 by none other than Soulless Stiff K.Griff himself.\n\n[The Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock.

Cohen\u2019s art collection is essentially no different than any other standard Ape\u2019s art collection. He\u2019s just like you or me.\n\nAnd c\u2019mon\u2026show of hands, how many apes out there are majority owners of a professional sports franchise? I know you\u2019re out there. Stop being so bashful.\n\nThe point is that he is *only* *trying to make a living* just like everyone else. Geesh. He only made $1.7 billion in 2020 during the pandemic. Cut the guy some slack.\n\nAnd he\u2019s been a real stand-up guy his entire career. His first job after graduating college in 1978 was at Gruntal & Co. and he didn\u2019t waste any time building the impeccable reputation that follows him to this day. He was the subject of insider trading investigations throughout the 1980\u2019s, and court documents filed by his then wife, Patricia, indicated that Cohen was stressed and in a near-panic. In June 1986, the SEC finally called him to testify\u2026\n\nBut he refused to answer any questions or provide trading records or any of the other documents that he was subpoenaed to produce. He basically sat silent while his lawyer answered questions about\u2026why he wouldn\u2019t be answering any questions. He took the Fifth without actually explicitly stating that he was taking the Fifth. Even when he did provide an answer, he didn\u2019t really answer\u2026\n\n**SEC staff attorney:** What is your date and place of birth?\n\n**Steven A. Cohen:** Upon the advice of counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question on the ground that I\u2019m being compelled to be a witness against myself.\n\nCohen was never charged with anything, but things didn\u2019t really cool down for him as the SEC subsequently started peering into his investments involving Brett K. Lurie, his one-time lawyer and \u201cexceptionally good friend.\u201d\n\nUncle Brett, as he was known to Steve\u2019s kids, would later be convicted on eight counts of conducting a scheme to defraud in the first degree, nine counts of intentional real estate securities fraud, three counts of grand larceny in the second degree, three counts of grand larceny in the third degree, and one count of offering a false instrument for filing...in the first degree. He skipped out on his sentencing (and also the court hearing for his disbarment by the NJ Supreme Court, that dirty little rascal) but was later apprehended in Costa Rica and ended up serving 3 years in state prison.\n\nStevie boy once again escaped unscathed.\n\nAfter being the subject of so many investigations he decided that it was time to ascend the ladder and extend the radius of his positive light, so in 1992 Steblen A. Colon started his own hedge fund, S.A.C. Capital Advisors, the name derived from his initials.\n\nBefore we talk any more about Steven \u201cEveryman\u201d A. \u201cis for asshole\u201d Cohen, let\u2019s step aside for a moment and get to know another character interwoven into the history of GME. Someone who happens to know Stevie Co-co (and his completely not evil businesses) quite well.\n\nEnter BJ Kang.\n\nKang is a name a few apes may know, but for those who are unfamiliar with him, he was an accountant before becoming a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s securities task force, and he played a major role in the investigation of Bernie Madoff. Just 309 days after Madoff\u2019s arrest, Kang would be photographed here:\n\n[October 16, 2009](https://preview.redd.it/rnt3kwbg7ry61.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b09aa5b6a157818c959dc809c8e487a84438388a)\n\nOne of these men is Kang and the other is Raj Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan hedge fund manager who, not long after this photo was taken, was convicted of 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, sentenced to 11 years in prison, and paid a combined $150 million in criminal and civil penalties. If you guessed Kang is the Korean American on the right wearing the dark blue FBI jacket and Raj is the guy on the left rawking the button-up sweater vest with his hands behind his back, you are correct. Well done, Apes.\n\nKang has been described as \"the most feared man on Wall Street\" and was so ice cold that Rajaratnam stated in an interview with Newsweek that as he was being hauled away from his family Kang said to him, \"Take a good look at your son. You're not going to see him for a long time. Your wife doesn't seem so upset. Because she's going to spend all your money.\"\n\nOuch\u2026\n\nAfter the Madoff and Raj Raj cases, court documents and interviews with industry insiders indicated that Kang\u2019s next target was going to be SAC Capital Advisors, L.P.\n\nYou see, Kang had already been interviewing SAC employees as far back as 2007 as part of an undisclosed investigation into alleged \u201ctrading irregularities\u201d at the fund. Along with evidence that SAC was manufacturing false negative analytical reports in order to help artificially manipulate stock prices and earn millions on their short positions (wait\u2026that sounds familiar\u2026), there was also the little problem of the SAC analyst who was forced to perform fellatio on his male supervisor before completing trades.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7sn7tkpk7ry61.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6dcbdc6f26faf0c7a2edd5a23375fb08b5088074\n\nYes, you read that correctly, and no, it\u2019s not fan fiction. Andrew Tong was the unfortunate soul who found himself providing mouth love in exchange for tendies while he was employed as an analyst at SAC. Tong had filed a lawsuit against his former male supervisor, Ping Jiang, a top trader for SAC, and alleged that he was forced to give Jiang blow jobs prior to completing trades. He also stated he was ordered to take female hormones so that he could become \u201cthe ideal analyst/trader.\u201d\n\n[Female hormones and blow jobs for trades? That's a bold strategy...](https://i.redd.it/hgyguadt7ry61.gif)\n\n\u201cSteven Cohen only wants us to make money, he doesn\u2019t care or want to know our secrets to make money -- SAC doesn\u2019t need to know and doesn\u2019t want to know,\u201d Tong stated in a court filing.\n\nAfter Jiang (the fellatee) ordered Tong (the fellator) and a couple other SAC underlings to engage in a scheme to manipulate the share price of a Chinese diesel engine manufacturing company (China Yuchai International Ltd.) and their efforts failed, SAC took a $3 million hit and Jiang blamed Tong for the loss. He was subsequently fired, but Tong stated that the ACTUAL reason he was fired was because he stopped taking female hormones and he was no longer providing hummers to Jiang. No one said a career in finance was going to be easy.\n\nKang continued to lead the latest investigation of SAC (remember, this is now a separate investigation from the one involving all the blow jobs) into 2011, along with collaboration from the Southern District of New York. Sadly, he would eventually be transferred out of the New York Office, but the case was left in the capable hands of Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the SDNY, and Richard Zabel, his deputy. Their evidence contained numerous examples of Cohen receiving seemingly inside information from his traders and analysts, something that some SAC employees told the FBI was \u201cpart of their job.\u201d\n\nIn one such instance Steve was sent an email from the research trader at SAC that contained inside information about Dell\u2019s ($DELL) quarterly earnings; he subsequently sold all 500,000 of his Dell shares. Two days after the email, Dell released its quarterly earnings (they didn\u2019t do so well\u2026) and their stock fell. Cohen, of course, avoided losing a substantial amount of money.\n\n[ Benjamin Bowmar Curtis, the actor in these infamous commercials, was arrested for purchasing 1\\/8th of marijuana in 2003.](https://preview.redd.it/xyy4a3fu7ry61.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=72138ad754e4bd088bdb58e7f7b961ce23765af4)\n\nFor reasons that should be obvious, Bharara and Zabel were considering a criminal indictment of Steev A-hole Co-In.\n\nSo our art collecting, MLB franchise owning defendant assembled the kind of legal dream team that only a billionaire could afford. It included such heavy hitters as Martin Klotz, his main defense attorney, outside legal advisor to Cohen and SAC Capital Advisors for over a decade, and the recipient of a Ph.D. in philosophy from Yale, and Theodore Wells, \u201cwhose closing statements were so powerful that he sometimes brought himself to tears.\u201d\n\nTheir defense of Cohen, a man described as \u201ca notoriously demanding boss\u201d with \u201caccess to every bit of trading data that was gathered by his portfolio managers and their teams\u201d and \u201ca rapacious consumer of information about his stocks,\u201d boiled down to this quote from Klotz: \u201cSteve does not remember reading it. He may not have read it.\u201d\n\n[ \u201cIt\u2019s just inconceivable that they didn\u2019t explore their position, with that much money flying around. It just isn\u2019t credible.\u201d -Richard Zabel](https://preview.redd.it/moh7vvb68ry61.jpg?width=666&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4b4fbded510ee857e0826352d297bea69535a87)\n\nIn the end, eight SAC employees were convicted or plead guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud. One such employee, Mathew Martoma, was found guilty of what federal prosecutors called \u201cthe most profitable insider-trading conspiracy in history.\u201d He was sentenced to 9 years in prison and ordered to forfeit more money than his actual net worth. Funny story about Martoma, he didn\u2019t testify in his own defense because if he had, he might have been required to answer questions about when he falsified a transcript of his grades and got expelled from Harvard Law School. Hey, at least he didn\u2019t force a subordinate to perform oral sex on him\u2026\n\n[Systemic criminality](https://preview.redd.it/ey2ocf278ry61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90975ea2cdae2a5f7ee41d31134d17b385078040)\n\nIn addition to all of the individual SAC employees, Bharara ultimately decided to indict SAC Capital itself. He described the firm as a \u201cmagnet for market cheaters.\u201d Their vast illegal trading had been ongoing for over a decade and had resulted in **illegal** profits of \u201cAT LEAST\u201d hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cWhen so many people from a single hedge fund have engaged in insider trading, it is not a coincidence. It is, instead, the predictable product of substantial and pervasive institutional failure. As alleged, S.A.C. trafficked in inside information on a scale without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds.\u201d\n\nThe SAC Capital Advisors hedge fund group eventually signed a guilty plea admitting to multiple counts of insider trading and fraud and agreed to pay a total of $1.8 billion in fines. It was also required to stop handling investments for outsiders. And despite the SEC initially seeking to ban Cohen from the industry **for life**, he eventually reached a settlement that allowed him to resume managing outside money after two years.\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t you know it, that sociopathic mass of unevolved protoplasm otherwise known as Steve Cohen was not criminally indicted. He was once again able to avoid facing any repercussions for his actions. As *The Financial Times* put it: \"\\[Cohen\\] escaped criminal indictment himself despite being the living, breathing heart of S.A.C. Capital\u2026\"\n\n***Steal a little and they throw you in jail. Steal a lot and they make you king.*** **-Bob Dylan**\n\nThankfully, Steve \u201cthe dirty cock sleeve\u201d Cohen learned his lesson and repented. SAC Capital Advisors transferred most of its assets and converted its operations to the Point72 Asset Management family office in 2014, and Cohen has maintained an impeccable workplace ever since.\n\nJust kidding. You didn\u2019t actually believe that did you?\n\nIn 2018, the two-year ban ended and Point72 was allowed to start accepting capital from external investors again. Also in 2018, Lauren Bonner, an associate director at Point72, filed a lawsuit accusing the firm of operating as a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d with a culture of \u201cstructural sexism.\u201d She alleged that women were belittled by high-level employees, with a top executive proclaiming \u201cno girls allowed\u201d prior to some meetings.\n\nAt the time of her lawsuit, only one of the 125 portfolio managers and only one of the 30 managing directors was a woman. None of the members of its hiring committee were women.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the little issue involving what was lovingly referred to as the \u201cPussy Board,\u201d a whiteboard in the office of then president of Point72, Douglas Haynes. \u201cFemale employees were humiliated and ashamed as they were forced to work and participate in meetings held in Haynes\u2019s office, including with other male executives, as the Pussy Board drifted above them, taunting them with repulsive references to their own bodies,\u201d Bonner said.\n\nHer complaint also stated that female employees \u201cregularly and openly discuss the fact that as long as Haynes is President at Point72, \u2018women will be paid less.\u2019\u201d Men were earning two to three times as much as their female counterparts at that time.\n\nHaynes resigned a little more than four weeks after the sexual discrimination lawsuit was filed.\n\n[Badly needed at Point72...](https://i.redd.it/jf0nb5vj9ry61.gif)\n\nAnd the list goes on and on and on\u2026\n\nThere are the numerous allegations of workplace misconduct, including sexual harassment, involving Cohen\u2019s New York Mets (to be fair, some of the allegations occurred prior to his purchase of the team).\n\nThe October 2019 lawsuit by former Point72 head of global macro, Sara Vavra, that asserted that Cohen \u201cbehaved in sexist ways and promoted a hostile work environment\u201d and he was \u201cbelittling other women who worked for the company.\u201d He called Vavra \u201cso stupid\u201d and \u201can idiot\u201d and used \u201ca derogatory word for a woman\u2019s genitals.\u201d\n\nLike Felicity Huffman or Lori Loughlin, he seems to have manipulated the college admission process. He provided a tax-deductible $5 million \u201cgift\u201d to USC at the same time that his twin daughters, Isabella and Olivia, were trying to get into USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, the perennial No. 1 ranked program on The Hollywood Reporter\u2018s Top 25 American Film Schools list. Surprise! They got two of the handful of highly competitive screenwriting spots at the school.\n\nAs Jessica Ramos of The NY Daily News wrote in her article, *Mets fans deserve better than Steve Cohen:* \u201cIt seems that wherever Cohen goes and whatever he touches, controversy and corruption follow in short order.\u201d\n\nReady to come full circle?\n\nAfter graduating college, Gabe Plotkin started his career at Citadel LLC, then later joined **SAC Capital** just before starting his own glorious firm, Melvin Capital. According to federal prosecutors, Plotkin received illegal insider information while at SAC. Shocking\u2026\n\nWhich side of an investment would you rather be on? The side with men like Steve Cohen and their fraud, conspiracy, and toxic workplace culture with disturbing accounts of sexual harassment? Or the side with men like Ryan Cohen, who built Chewy from the ground up with an emphasis on customer service, kindness, and compassion?\n\nI like my odds.\n\nSee you all at the after-party in Valhalla\u2026\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude80\n\nP.S. As Apes continue to invest wisely and inadvertently cause the demise of evil financial terrorists (and sexual deviants), it\u2019s important to remember Steven A. Cohen and do what can be done to prevent him from getting away scot-free yet again. Not only that, we must hold our politicians accountable and ensure that none of our tax dollars go towards \u201cbailing out\u201d or helping men like Steve. Let\u2019s make this world a better place.",
