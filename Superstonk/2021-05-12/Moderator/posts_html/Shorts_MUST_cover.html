<p><strong>Ok. Before the FUD gets out of hand.</strong></p>
<p>It was my fault for not directly asking if the short position in <strong>GameStop</strong> must be covered. </p>
<p>His answer was in response to the <strong>HISTORY of shorts not having to cover.</strong> This only happens when short sellers are able to drive the target company into the ground. I believe his full answer addressed this fact. This was MY fault for misguiding the question.  </p>
<p>Obviously, he talked for a very long time about the number of phantom shares that are circulating within the market. He also stated that GameStop is a prime example of this. </p>
<p>Phantom shares resulted from hyper-shorting with the intent of driving GameStop into the ground. When retail investors refused to sell through the onslaught of market manipulation, it reversed the game in our favor. </p>
<p>There is a very high chance, as he stated, that the shareholder vote will reflect the presence of continuous short selling (naked &amp; otherwise) because the problem is SO LARGE that even the "back-office" guys can't sort it out. </p>
<p>He also explained that the SEC has been turning a blind eye to these situations because they are RARELY over 100%. If we are correct, it will be much harder for them to sweep this under the rug. Finally, his outlook on the SEC's current leadership, especially Gary Gensler, is positive. </p>
<p>The perfect storm has arrived, <strong>so please don't let a misguided question spoil the confirmation bias in that AMA!!</strong></p>
