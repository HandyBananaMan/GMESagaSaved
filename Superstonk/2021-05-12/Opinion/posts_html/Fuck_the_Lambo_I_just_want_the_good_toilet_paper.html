<p>I don't want any fancy shit, I just want a modest life for my wife and kids and to not have to worry or even think about finances. I also want my parents to be able to retire at a decent age (which they are coming up on) and be able to do the things they want and enjoy the rest of their lives worry free. After a lifetime of working shouldn't everyone get to enjoy their life a little?</p>
