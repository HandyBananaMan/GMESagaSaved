u/CallMeMo2 posted [this image](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oe8dyz/when_shitadel_is_closed_with_less_than_300_share/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) some 5 hours ago and a lot of people upvoted and it even got an award because the message is what people look for in their confirmation bias and an overall silent day with no trading.

**The problem is the ape is wrong.**

u/CallMeMo2's post is limited to just the index he looked at and did not look further for more info.

What you are looking at is GS2C.F (GS2C:FF or GS2C:FRA) which has a volume of 310 for today and trades on Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

**In Germany GME trades under the following indices and they all traded today for different values on 8 exchanges:**

1. GS2C:BER     Berlin Stock Exchange         94 units
2. GS2C:MUN   Munich Stock Exchange      110 units
3. GS2C:STU     Stuttgart Stock Exchange    988 u.
4. GMEa:DEU   German Composite               6.22k
5. GS2C:DUS    Dusseldorf Stock Exchange 14
6. GS2C:FRA     Frankfurt Stock Exchange    310 < *the one you have seen*
7. GMEX,A:GER  XETRA                                     889
8. GS2C:HAM    Hamburg Stock Exchange   83

Here is a breakdown:

[Gettex works under Munich SE, Tradegate in Berlin and Quotrix is ​​a system of the Düsseldorf Stock Exchange. ](https://preview.redd.it/s5q4wzx2eg971.jpg?width=999&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b34f11d01fc915312e8fd6bbf7f49d218d86f45)

Today GME also traded on the following markets:

1. Mexico             61 units
2. Switzerland    10 units

There are also some stocks traded OTC today:

[ Baader Bank AG is an investment bank located in Unterschleißheim, Germany. Lang & Schwarz \(Long & Black\) is an OTC board under the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.](https://preview.redd.it/0bgoen71eg971.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b18226f9d1cf8740cb8ba978cd24d5fdc1de4c7b)

Apparently even in London 75 stocks exchanged hands probably OTC:

[Someone familiar to London markets probably could tell us what usually trades on SETSqx.](https://preview.redd.it/mcyh6d6weg971.jpg?width=1011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5ceb2e86da7e75662e66695d2165278e5b06f1e)

To have a look at what this means here are a few conclusions:

1. The volume is a bit bigger than what [OP stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oe8dyz/when_shitadel_is_closed_with_less_than_300_share/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Not compared to a normal NYSE trading day but not 300 either.
2. Up/Down moves are relative to markets not overall value since the stock is not traded at the same value converted in CHF or EUR as you see in USD. For example:

* On Switzerland those 10 share I guess were sold as the price decreased -3.60 / -1.88%

https://preview.redd.it/h8goqyd9ig971.jpg?width=649&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cfa2baab2830004175d8bcaaf10a40f3671654e

* On Stuttgart (also in Germany) the values are -0.05 / -0.03%

https://preview.redd.it/fbvzy0y7ig971.jpg?width=584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d068229b9b7f6d96a195f1c47ff015b4b4edb6ae

1. Given the overall low volume and the fact that NYSE was closed the up/downs are actually separated by exchange instead of having the same values.

I do not believe what u/CallMeMo2 is trying to do is FUD but more a lack of know-how and documentation.

Edit 1: There is an inconsistency reported by FT for Stuttgart (988) and [Finanzen.net](https://Finanzen.net) (313). I cannot explain the difference.

Edit 2: u/MaterialLake1138 suggested this for German markets [https://www.onvista.de/aktien/handelsplaetze/GAMESTOP-CORP-Aktie-US36467W1099](https://www.onvista.de/aktien/handelsplaetze/GAMESTOP-CORP-Aktie-US36467W1099) and I think it covers all the exchanges in Germany in one place including OTC.

Edit 3: Some of you mentioned the overall volume on Monday is not relevant given the insignificant amount of shares traded. It is true and it is not the purpose of this post.
