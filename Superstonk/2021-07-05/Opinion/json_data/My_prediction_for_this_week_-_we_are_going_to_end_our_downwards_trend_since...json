    "selftext": "The T+21 and/or the T+35 cycle is legit and we've all but confirmed it directly. They are stuck in a loop until they get margin called/force liquidated. \n\nEveryone's seen the [awesome TA post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/od7swq/wen_moon_10_endgame_final_ta/) showing all the signals/indicators for an upcoming move to the upside - a potentially very large one.\n\nEveryone's also read the Elliot Wave Guy's posts which fits with the current upward trajectory narrative.\n\nBut I haven't seen anyone mention this in the past few weeks so I will hopefully be the first one to bring it up. 10 days ago [I made a post about why we didn't see any FTD covering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o787jm/30_minutes_til_the_final_bell_and_still_no_ftd/) on the usual full-moon T+21/35 day cycle we were on track for every month until June.\n\nThe reason, in my honest opinion, is that they started covering the week before the earnings call with every intention of dropping the price using what little ammo they had left to drop the price like they did back in March and to throw off our \"confirmed\" prediction of the T+21/35 cycle. It had a double whammy effect in their minds but we're apes and we HODL no matter what. And some of us saw right through their stupid psychological fuckery (the only real fuckery they have left).\n\nBut because they covered that week, the latest we should see another price spike is Thursday/Friday of this week which resumes their cycle from then instead of the 23-26th (full moon cycle). The indicators are all firing off and the TA is solidly signaling a big move upwards. Of which I wholeheartedly agree. But the caveat is that, in order to throw off our confirmation of the T+21/35 cycle, they had to start it from another date which was the trading week before the shareholder meeting when we saw that big rise in the early days of June.\n\nThis week is the T+21/35 days cycle from that week and I fully believe we may start seeing the cycle stuck in this week now instead of the last week of the month.  \n\nFuckle up, buckers. I think this week is going to be a big'un. If not then we continue to buy & hodl regardless. \n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice, don't do anything with your money with the information contained within this post. I'm retarded and have no clue what I'm talking about.\n\nEDIT - Disclaimer #2: **DO NOT DAY TRADE $GME WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ABOVE!** Day trading is for paper handed losers. You should already well know this by now but it's worth mentioning again.\n\nTL;DR - Big moves this week coinciding with all the TA signals, EW Guy's \"predictions\" and the refreshment of the T+21/35 day cycle that was changed from the 23-26th historically, to this week going forward.",
