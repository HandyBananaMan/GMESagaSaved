#Title: SUN TZU: TO KNOW YOUR ENEMY, YOU MUST BECOME YOUR ENEMY. I personally think Kenny is going to set off the MOASS. Why? Cause it's exactly what I would do if I were him.

This sounds crazy.  Very crazy, tinfoil hat even.... But hear me out.  

Hedgies are fuk.  Everyone knows it.  We all know it.  All shorts must cover.  Everyone knows it.  Media won't touch GME with a 2000 ft pole.  Media is paid off and complicit.  It's not "if MOASS" it's "wen MOASS".

There was a DD recently about some "live" liquidity testing.  Something in the realm of 40k volume in buys was enough to raise the price that it took 180K shorts to bring the price back down.  The hypothesis was that this was long Wales testing  the extremely unstable waters with very little capital.   I say it's the opposite.  I think it's Kenny testing the liftoff.   Why?  Cause it's exactly what I would do.  

If I were a pompous, greedy, ego maniac that was backed into a corner like a wet cat with literally NO escape except kicking the can, I'd want to Fuck over anyone else in my path.  Nobody wants to be the last HF holding the shorts.  What's the next best thing? Be the first.....

As I see it, if I were Kenny, here's how I would do it.  

1. Live liquidity testing on shit volume days.   See how unstable the price is with differing amounts of buy pressure.  Basically take your foot off the break and tap the gas peddle.  Test the MOASS.  Bring the price up and back down.  Do it a bunch of times to see which other HFs start to freak out.  Know who would fall first in the chain.

2.  Start spreading FUD about all the other HF short on GME.  It's not just Shitadel and we all know it.  We're waiting for the little dominos to knock over the big one's, but if the end result is the same (all shorts must cover) and there's literally no way out, I'd start changing my image from the only bad guy to "one of many" bad guys.  Get their names out there.  (We've seen this recently)

3.  Compile PFOF data.  They get (or used to get) almost the entirety of the order flow data from brokers.  They can within a pretty good estimate determine the FED'S max pain.  When I say the FED's max pain, I'm talking March/April/May 2022.  Why?  Cause that's when the majority of the retail float goes short term to long term.  If the FED were to ever step in, it would be if they find out they are only getting 15% tax off the MOASS vs ~40%.  Both scenarios work out.  Trigger the MOASS where the largest number of stonks move to long term and maybe the FED will step in and save them (cause they know the FED wants that money) OR, Fuck the fed and take them down with em. 

4.  Keep a VERY close eye on Cohen.  Cohen has a crytp0 dividend in his back pocket.  A reverse uno card.  Based off #1 live liquidity testing, he already knows how long it would take where he would get margin called to start covering.  If Cohen announced a crypt0 dividend, I would trigger the MOASS that very day within minutes.  Before it can be issued, it takes 10 days from the announcement.  Then if it's anything like overstonk, it could get lawsuits to suppress.  All the meanwhile, he'd get to start covering in dirty dirty ways and hide as much as possible before all REAL shares are tied to a crypt0.  

5.  As he starts to cover shorts and the economy starts to tank, counterbalance with some longs that will also moon.  Anyone notice they are long on movie stonk? *Wink* *wink*

TL;DR: 
If I was a wall street prick with an ego bigger than the short interest on GME, the last thing I'd want to be is the next Bear Stearns.  Last to hold the bag pays the most or closes it's doors.  If MOASS is inevitable, I'd get out first.  If I'm going down, Fuck everyone and they're all going down with me.  But in NO way am I the last to hold the bag.  I'd rather be first and brag about it in a TED talk a year from now.
