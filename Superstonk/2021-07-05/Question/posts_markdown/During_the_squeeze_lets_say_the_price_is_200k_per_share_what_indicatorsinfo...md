Genuine question. We’ve done all the DD that shows how far this can go. But there will be sellers up to the $200k point (RIP), so I’m wondering what information we can use to evaluate the situation as it unfolds. I ask this because I have persuaded friends to buy GME who aren’t on Reddit and I want to be able to provide reassurance to them during the squeeze that “it ain’t over yet”. I’m completely diamond hands regardless, but I’m guessing things are going to be happening very fast during the squeeze, it will be good to know what to look for so we don’t feel in “no mans land”.
