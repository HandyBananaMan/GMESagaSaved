But there will be sellers up to the $200k point (RIP), so I\u2019m wondering what information we can use to evaluate the situation as it unfolds. I ask this because I have persuaded friends to buy GME who aren\u2019t on Reddit and I want to be able to provide reassurance to them during the squeeze that \u201cit ain\u2019t over yet\u201d. I\u2019m completely diamond hands regardless, but I\u2019m guessing things are going to be happening very fast during the squeeze, it will be good to know what to look for so we don\u2019t feel in \u201cno mans land\u201d. \n\nCheers Apes \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc8e",
