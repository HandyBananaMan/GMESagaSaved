    "selftext": "Hello apes. I thought I would yet again, share one of my post MOASS goals. Though it's more of a proposition to people who live in rural areas. It's gonna be a bit harder for urbanites.\n\nEverybody keeps going on about giving back to the community, people in need, and charities. Which is wonderful. But I feel like too many people seem to gloss over the planet itself, and our place in it. Not to mention, it's a totally different feel and experience, between taking part in the charity, and simply mailing a check to an organisation and have them do the work themselves. \n\nWhat do I mean? Simple. Don't just buy a small rectangular plot of land to build your dream house on. Buy the entire hill. Buy the entire mountain. And use that land to reconnect with mother nature.\n\nHave your own fruit and vegetable garden. Work the land. Feed the soil. Get humbled by having to work in tandem with the earth, to feed your own self.\n\nGet a few farm animals. A couple of goats, a chicken coop, a honey bee hive. Take part in the ecosystem. Feed them today, so they can provide you with eggs, milk, and honey, tomorrow. \n\nLet's say you live in an area where wild and abandoned house pets run rampant. Try saving them. Build a little haven for these animals, to either live safely in your land, or at least drop by for some food. Instead of having them ravage the town's rubbish bins, get hit by cars, or kicked by brats. I mean hell, you could even make a small artificial lake for migrating ducks or whatever, to rest and eat in their travels.\n\nAnd let's say you don't have the time or the will to deal with a vegetable garden and a few farm animals. Not a problem. Go get a farmer that had trouble keeping afloat. Tell him that he takes care of everything, 20% or whatever of the harvest is for you, the rest he can keep and go sell at his own profit at the market. And on week-ends, he teaches you a bit of farm work.\n\nNot to mention, with an entire hill/mountain, you can go all out with your hobbies. Have yourself a basketball court, a skateboard ramp, an archery range, a horse riding route, practice your survival and hunting skills, go nuts. \n\nYou can do so much people. Let's actually be active, and not just be a bunch of check-writing machines.\n\nObligatory \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",
