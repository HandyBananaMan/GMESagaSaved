Below I have outlined why I think the current price of GME is super deeply discounted. This DD is not even going to factor in anything regarding the MOASS, as that has been so deeply covered already. WHEN the shorts finish covering, I think the share price will have climbed to astronomical levels...BUT, where will it drop back down to and grow from in the years to come? That's what I attempted to find out. Please feel free to cross-check my work and add corrections - I don't want to be right, I want to be as accurate as possible. Please don't up-vote this because you like the numbers, up-vote it so as many wrinkle brains as possible see this and either confirm or refute it as "good DD".

Before I get started, let me drop this \*\*Disclaimer\*\* on why this info could be wrong -

1: I am not a financial advisor (and this obviously should not be construed as financial advice).

2: I ate a strong edible right as I started working on this.

3: The side, along with that edible, was a large box of Caran d'Ache crayons. They are my favorite...not because they taste any better, but because I can pretend that I am "sophisticated" if I eat things I cant pronounce.

Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, lets get to the MEAT of the post!

So \~$620 a share is a 205% increase from the current value of $203. How did I get this number? No, I did not pull it from my ass, as that trick has already been played out by our good friend u/rick_of_spades. I got that number by dissecting how much of Amazon's current market cap we could theoretically "steal". I think that for the most part, a companies "value" is directly attributed to how much money they bring in.

&#x200B;

![$1.77 Trillion - current Amazon Mkt cap](https://preview.redd.it/rf85ubwc4c971.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=c858d65657d0bfa6a87cc2e0a7cab8029d2fe0d6)

At first I was thinking, "if we can take even 20% of Amazons business, then we will have hundreds of billions we can add to GME's MC!" However, I quickly realized that superficial calculation was way off base. Amazon does MUCH more than just sell things, they have AWS, Prime Video, etc. So the first step in my modified calculation was to figure out what % of Amazons MC was actually in something GS could potentially siphon. For that I needed to analyze where all of Amazons revenue comes from.

&#x200B;

![Potential $163 Billion in annual revenue - 50.6&#37; of Amazons total revenue](https://preview.redd.it/b3ipwveh7c971.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f082df0f43f73e769b05559b059fdcb1c1de39d7)

According to [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/amazon-revenue-model-2020/](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/amazon-revenue-model-2020/) \- From June 2019 to June 2020, around half of Amazons revenue came from selling their own inventory online. They also made money in fees from allowing 3rd parties to sell on their site; subscription services like Prime; Amazon Web Services (cloud servers); and from "physical stores" which mostly comprise of grocery sales through whole foods. I did not include any of those other than the "online sales" as viable sources for GME to siphon, sadly not even the physical locations...although GME does have stores, the things they sell are so different it did not make sense to me to make a comparison there, even though I am sure there is some relation/benefit there as well.

In any case, we can take the \~50% off the top right away and say that the market cap we can actually steal as things currently stand, is $0.885 Trillion (or $885 Billion). HOWEVER..Amazon sells way more categories of products than GME does. I know we are adding new categories every week, but we must deal in absolutes here to maintain objectivity. So now I had to figure out what portion of that was actually, actually ripe for the picking by Gamestop...

First we need to look at what Gamestop sells.

&#x200B;

![oOooOO...cool stuff!](https://preview.redd.it/n2kwdk3udc971.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ef4202e211415b021b9baf7d3ac2ddc59ec56d)

&#x200B;

Basically, we can condense all of the above to games (which includes digital), toys, and electronics/gadgets. I omitted the clothing because lets be honest, a random gaming t-shirt sale is a drop in the bucket as compared to all the shoes, handbags, pants, etc etc that Amazon sells. Now we need to see where the overlap is with what Amazon sells.

&#x200B;

![22.1&#37; of Amazon products sold are in currently target-able categories](https://preview.redd.it/9moy8om2bc971.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f004f21eac52d24feff91c8fdc65a73c4213ec)

This stat was tougher to find, and I am hopeful some other apes can potentially find better, but [https://trends.edison.tech/research/2018-ebay-vs-amazon.html](https://trends.edison.tech/research/2018-ebay-vs-amazon.html) says that of all the items sold by Amazon, 3.4% were from "Toys & Games"; 6.9% (nice) from "Software & Mobile Apps"; and 10.8% from "Electronics & Accessories". That gives us a total of 22.1% of all things sold by Amazon, that could potentially be bought from Gamestop instead. So if we take the $885B figure from before, and we take 22.1% of that, we are left with roughly a $196 Billion target market, which I am going to round up to $200B for the sake of simplicity. So! After all that, we are finally close to figuring out how much GME's market cap could increase if they steal a certain percent of Amazons business.

I modeled 3 different potentials, and I feel like all 3 are fairly conservative, considering Ryan Cohen has a proven track record of eating Amazons business, akin to the OG thug "Franklin" from GTA 5 stealing a convertible from an old lady in the middle of the street. However, this part is easy to model on your own so you can get a figure YOU think is correct. Just ask yourself, "how much business will Gamestop steal from Amazon?"

&#x200B;

![$14.6 Billion - current Gamestop Mkt cap ](https://preview.redd.it/hti8jqc3hc971.png?width=1013&format=png&auto=webp&s=69f213fac5ff3bbd181d59438687b76a79a7a5bc)

&#x200B;

If you think 5%, then that is a $10 Billion increase (5% of the 200B figure from above) in GME's market cap. An jump of 10B on top of 14.6B is 24.6B, or an increase of 68%. If the current share price ($203) of GME grew by 68%, then we would be looking at $341 per share.

If you think GS could steal 15% of Amazons business, then that would be an extra $30B to add onto GME's MC. That would give us a total of 44.6B, which is an increase of 205% from 14.6B. If the current share price rose by 205%, then we would be looking at $620!!!

Lastly, if you think GS could steal 25% of Amazons business, then that would be an extra $50B to add onto GME's MC. That would give us a total of 64.6B, which is an increase of 341% from 14.6B. If the current share price rose by 341%, then we would be looking at a whopping $895!!!!!!!!

Some final points to consider:

I think this examination is not looking at enough angles. It's basically a 2D inspection of a 3D object. I am sure there are way more metrics to look at, I am just not wrinkly enough to fathom them all and relate it to the above in any meaningful way.

I did not take into account anything "groundbreaking" that could be coming down the pipe, like the NFT marketplace for digital games, or anything else big that RC is likely cooking up.

Perhaps that edible was way too strong and I am completely off base here. Either way, I am hoping this post can be a launching pad for someone much smarter than me to write an even better DD post detailing the long term fair value for GME!

Before I sign off, I just want to give a small amount of DD on why I think Amazon is the company the Gamestop is targeting. All we need to do is look at RC, what he has accomplished in the past, and what his apparent *modus operandi* is.

All this guy breathes, eats, and dreams, is ways to take on Amazon effectively.

"Finally, there’s a reason it has successfully passed mammoth Amazon.com in pet food market share, according to [eMarketer Retail](https://retail.emarketer.com/article/heres-why-petsmart-wants-chewy/58f7d3caebd4000a54864b23), and is a favorite of everyone from families to veterinarians."

[https://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-cohen-gamestop-transformation-ecommerce-explained-2021-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-cohen-gamestop-transformation-ecommerce-explained-2021-3) \- This article is titled "Take a look inside Wall Street darling Ryan Cohen's ambitious plan to 'transform' the retailer into the Amazon of gaming" and outlines all the ways that RC is gonna clean house vs Amazon.

So its safe to say that Amazon has reason to worry!

TL;DR: If you went into a coma and didn't wake up until after the MOASS was over, you would still make a shit ton of money on your GME shares, b/c RC knows EXACTLY how to steal business from Amazon, and the target market is worth about $200 Billion dollars. With access to such a significant revenue pool, the market cap (and thus the share price) for GME will likely be more than tripled from the current price.

Buy. Hold. Profit.
