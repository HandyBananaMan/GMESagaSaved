![Hey SuperStonk](https://imgur.com/ZzQ4pcW)

Do you like lists? I sure do. I'm ZedInstead and I'm retarded. I can't write DD and numbers hurt my smooth brain but I do have a specific set of skills. These are ![my feelings towards Ken Griffen](https://imgur.com/OCVKM6G).

Currently I have three projects going.

1. The Forrest Gump GME Meme Movie: [Part 25 was posted last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9vidq/the_forrest_gump_gme_meme_movie_here_is_part_25/) - If you haven't watched yet, start from the beginning(full scene list in comments). Still working on 3 more scenes so stay tuned!
2. SuperStonk Guide: [Issue 14 was posted Friday morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oc98t6/i_wonder_what_regularly_scheduled_programs_are_on/) - Comment in the latest issue to be on the super awesome subscription service! 
3. The List: The [OG list can be found here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nzzpdy/i_guess_im_the_guy_that_makes_lists_now_so_lets/). Let's talk about the new list!

It started out as my own personal address book of the wrinkle brains. Then the joke started going around about how "we've got a guy for that" and "we know a girl for this" so I posted my list and there was some interest in it as a resource and I've continued building it. Now its grown to 100 apes and includes several sections. It is way for me to recognize apes who regularly contribute to the community and most of all, its fun. Let me also say that every ape out there is important no matter how often they post or how low-quality of a meme they create or even just the ninja apes that are out there lurking, your just being here is awesome and you make this place amazing.


NOMINATING: I want to be as inclusive as possible without the list melting into nonsense categories and no longer being useful. Reach out to me if you see an ape that is doing something noteworthy out there and I will get them added. I don't want to be the gatekeeper to this list, let's grow it to 200! There aren't any serious qualifications to it other than I am not including mods and I'm hoping that each user is doing 'that thing' on a semi-regular basis. Please help with genders and titles!

NOTE: If any ape on this list is uncomfortable being listed here please reach out and I will promptly remove your title and user name. 

FUD WARNING: Last time I posted this I had some apes spreading FUD with a capital F for Fear. The HFs have better lists created in Tableau so no I'm not making their jobs easier or helping shills target these people as these apes are on the front page most days. Also, please don't go into the whole hero worship slippery slope thing. 

REITERATING THIS POINT: I just like making lists and sharing them with the public. Not financial advice.
