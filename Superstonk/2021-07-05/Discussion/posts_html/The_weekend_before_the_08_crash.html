<p>So from what I remember reading. Before the 2008 crash, all the business was done over the weekend and then on the following Monday. Everything was set to be destroyed. </p>
<p>Does anyone remember what exactly happened that weekend? Was there any news that the general populace would have picked up on? </p>
<p>There’s new headlines every day about shady shite going on and I’m just wondering after this long weekend if there’s anything apes would see that was similar to the weekend before the ‘08 crash. </p>
<p>HYPE everyday!</p>
<p>Edit: holy crap. This got big
Loving the discussions! Some wrinkles sneaking around here me thinks. (Not me)</p>
