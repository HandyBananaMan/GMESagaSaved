    "selftext": "So from what I remember reading. Before the 2008 crash, all the business was done over the weekend and then on the following Monday. Everything was set to be destroyed. \n\nDoes anyone remember what exactly happened that weekend? Was there any news that the general populace would have picked up on? \n\nThere\u2019s new headlines every day about shady shite going on and I\u2019m just wondering after this long weekend if there\u2019s anything apes would see that was similar to the weekend before the \u201808 crash. \n\nHYPE everyday!\n\nEdit: holy crap. This got big\nLoving the discussions! Some wrinkles sneaking around here me thinks. (Not me)",
