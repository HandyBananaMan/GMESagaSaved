If they will not hold our governing agencies accountable but still use information to keep their money they should be indicated with the manipulators and sent to jail.\n \nEdit: someone said a guy posted about politicians and a site that tracks their selling. If this is real time data or close to real time I think we need that post pinned to top of board daily\n\nEdit: the more eyes on potential signs of fuckery the better off we are.",
