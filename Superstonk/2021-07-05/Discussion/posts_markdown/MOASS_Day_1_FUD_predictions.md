Hello frens, Y'all lookin kinda cute over there.

So the day the MOASS really kicks off you KNOW the shills will go all out. So I have been planning for this day. No matter what, day 1 is not a day for selling, it is a day for jackin'! The MOASS will likely take days or likely a couple weeks.

**\*\*Heres some of the ideas I expect:\*\***:

1: MASSIVE amounts of fake gain porn *in the first couple days*.- screen shots of silly %s and likely LARGE share counts too. "ThIs WiLl ChAnGe My LiFe!" etc etc. This is to make you think others have and are selling.

The relentless meme reposting is exactly for this reason, IMO, to farm for enough Karma.

2: Brokers will turn off the buy button again. We pretty much already know RH will do this, as will others. Some wont have a choice from higher ups.

It wont matter for us, only FOMOers. Basically, get your tickets now before we take off.

3: Discord spamming and likely mass Discord/Reddit reporting. The point will be to disrupt comms and make us all feel alone. THE WORST THING WHEN THE TIME COMES WILL BE CHANTS OF "HODL! HODL! HODL!" and you KNOW we will be chanting this shit together.

4: MS Media

Holy shit, who the fuck knows what they end up saying. I will be turning my phone off and staring at my PC only, for every second the market is open.

P.S. Have desk snacks n drinks with you ready. When we go, we GO!

We are all prepped and think we are ready, this will be like our grandparents storming the beaches and running head first into war! This will brutal on us. It will be hard. It will be amazing. Never forget your resolve! Never forget what this all truly is! Remember the INFINITY POOL

Happy Hype day for tomorrow!

Peace and love

EDIT: ape no spell gud

5: *Expect Reddit to go down!* Its for the same reason as above. Divide and conquer, and to stop people communicating.
