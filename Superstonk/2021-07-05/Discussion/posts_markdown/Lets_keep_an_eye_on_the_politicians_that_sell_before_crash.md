We need to hold our government accountable for knowing what is about to happen and saving their money. If any politician sells before crash the need to be removed in my opinion. If they will not hold our governing agencies accountable but still use information to keep their money they should be indicated with the manipulators and sent to jail.
 
Edit: someone said a guy posted about politicians and a site that tracks their selling. If this is real time data or close to real time I think we need that post pinned to top of board daily

Edit: the more eyes on potential signs of fuckery the better off we are.
