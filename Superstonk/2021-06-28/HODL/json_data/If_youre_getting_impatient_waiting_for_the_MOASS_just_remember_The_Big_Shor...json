    "selftext": "Michael Bury identified the problems with the mortgage bonds in 2005. He knew at that time they would start to fail in 2007. He bet hundreds of millions of dollars on it, knowing he would have to wait at least 1.5 to 2 years to see any return.\n\nThen, in the spring of 2007, when the bonds should've started failing, but the banks were doing some kind of fuckery to keep it from happening, his boss was demanding that he get out of the positions. His clients were threatening to sue. But he still held. Through everything.\n\nAnd it paid off. 2 years and an unbelievable amount of pressure. We've got it so easy compared to that.",
