<h1>I WISH I COULD BE A CITADEL EMPLOYEE RIGHT NOW.</h1>
<p>I would stay up late and help the team with all their hard work and late nights. I would provide feedback on graphs and charts of their positions in various stocks. I would get the coffee. Print all the hand outs. Make CD copies of vital and important information. I would work tirelessly countless hours just slaving away behind my computer to collect and analyze data for the next days morning meeting. </p>
<p>I'm pretty good at getting food too. Like I'd go to the best bagel place, coffee place, sandwich place, pizza place. I would make sure everyone is fed and at the very least lucid for their next teleconference. </p>
<p>When no one is looking...</p>
<h3>I would slowly collect all the information and documents that I need to bury that entire company with the SEC. I would bring all the info to various news sources and make sure I get paid multimillion dollar whistle-blower money. Also probably write a book about "corruption and Evil at CITADEL LLC"</h3>
<p>Have a great day CITADEL Interns.</p>
