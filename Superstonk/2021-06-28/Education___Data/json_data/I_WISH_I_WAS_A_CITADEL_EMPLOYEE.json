    "selftext": "# I WISH I COULD BE A CITADEL EMPLOYEE RIGHT NOW.\n\nI would stay up late and help the team with all their hard work and late nights. I would provide feedback on graphs and charts of their positions in various stocks. I would get the coffee. Print all the hand outs. Make CD copies of vital and important information. I would work tirelessly countless hours just slaving away behind my computer to collect and analyze data for the next days morning meeting. \n\nI'm pretty good at getting food too. Like I'd go to the best bagel place, coffee place, sandwich place, pizza place. I would make sure everyone is fed and at the very least lucid for their next teleconference. \n\nWhen no one is looking...\n\n### I would slowly collect all the information and documents that I need to bury that entire company with the SEC. I would bring all the info to various news sources and make sure I get paid multimillion dollar whistle-blower money. Also probably write a book about \"corruption and Evil at CITADEL LLC\"\n\nHave a great day CITADEL Interns.",
