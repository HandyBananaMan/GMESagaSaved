\u2197)\n\n# \n\n# Reverse repo's\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7s3ux/daily\\_reverse\\_repo\\_update\\_0625\\_770830b/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7s3ux/daily_reverse_repo_update_0625_770830b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nIt seems the reverse repo's are now at 770.830 with 74 participants.\n\nI'd also advise to check out the top comment pinned to that thread as it explains quite a bit on how the repo's have been increasing and even includes this :\n\n[Reverse Repo's explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o27k2h/reverse_repo_operations_explaining_their_purpose/)\n\n# \n\n# The exponential floor\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7va1q/0625\\_update\\_floor\\_guys\\_log\\_stonkdate\\_268\\_russell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7va1q/0625_update_floor_guys_log_stonkdate_268_russell/)\n\nSeems we are still sitting bellow the exponential floor u/JTH1 came up with, again I believe this shows that standard TA is hard to pin down on this sub, but its good to keep an eye on models like this because it does show us what was previously thought of, and gives us a good starting point for the next possible model.\n\nWith enough data collected someone like JTH1 could start making a new accurate model.\n\n# \n\n# The Russel 1000\n\n[https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru1000\\_membershiplist\\_20210628.pdf](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru1000_membershiplist_20210628.pdf)\n\nIt's official GME has been added to the R1K, I believe I even read somewhere that GME is only 1 single good quarter away from joining the S&P 500, but I'm not sure about that (as this is from memory) perhaps a wrinklebrain can help out and check this out to make sure we are indeed about to join that as well.\n\nAlso good thing to note, I believe the Q2 is about to close at the end of June\ud83e\udd14 wait wouldn't that be... heheh\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fud campaigns\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8pk79/what\\_i\\_see\\_when\\_i\\_zoom\\_out\\_shout\\_out\\_to\\_uayyyybro/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8pk79/what_i_see_when_i_zoom_out_shout_out_to_uayyyybro/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nu/bah2o was awesome enough that they created a timeline of all the FUD campaigns we have seen up to this date, you can see the stuff they already tried to pull, it doesn't matter if these people who were part of this fud campaigns were trolls/shills/bots\n\nThe important thing is just what was posted.\n\nThanks  u/bah2o for giving satori some more food to process \ud83d\ude09\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DTCC-011\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o908v9/thought\\_sausage\\_my\\_take\\_on\\_dtcc\\_the\\_011/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o908v9/thought_sausage_my_take_on_dtcc_the_011/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nHere is a thread about the dtcc 011, join the discussion and lets see if we can all form some new wrinkles.\n\nMy take on it so far is that the amendment was something along the lines of \"cut off the foot to save the leg\" kindof action, but what the hell do I know

writeup about why certain stocks have recently perhaps been offering shares and others have not.\n\nIt could be (imo) that some stock companies are doing an ATM share offering so that when legal action does indeed come they can't say \"well we couldn't cover\" can now be met with \"nah bitch you had 10 million shares coming out in less than six months, you CHOSE not to cover\".\n\n(yes I still hope they go after the SHF who do illegal shit with jail time).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Possible Crypto Dividend.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o933f5/crypto\\_hints\\_being\\_dropped\\_in\\_gmes\\_prospectus/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o933f5/crypto_hints_being_dropped_in_gmes_prospectus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nSeems like we missed some stuff in the filings, thank god people like  u/loggic found this.\n\nGive his thread a look they go over how they possibly could offer crypto dividend and other things my brain is to smooth to explain for.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o94pad/why\\_didnt\\_we\\_read\\_the\\_prospectus\\_the\\_reset\\_button/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o94pad/why_didnt_we_read_the_prospectus_the_reset_button/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAnother
