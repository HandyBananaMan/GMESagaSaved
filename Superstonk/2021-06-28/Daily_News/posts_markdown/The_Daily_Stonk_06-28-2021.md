Something is wrong with reddit at the moment could not upload any pictures, and keeps giving me errors but in getting the news out asap I thought I'd get it out now and try to add images later if needed.

Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

# Reverse repo's

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7s3ux/daily\_reverse\_repo\_update\_0625\_770830b/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7s3ux/daily_reverse_repo_update_0625_770830b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

It seems the reverse repo's are now at 770.830 with 74 participants.

I'd also advise to check out the top comment pinned to that thread as it explains quite a bit on how the repo's have been increasing and even includes this :

# The exponential floor

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7va1q/0625\_update\_floor\_guys\_log\_stonkdate\_268\_russell/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7va1q/0625_update_floor_guys_log_stonkdate_268_russell/)

Seems we are still sitting bellow the exponential floor u/JTH1 came up with, again I believe this shows that standard TA is hard to pin down on this sub, but its good to keep an eye on models like this because it does show us what was previously thought of, and gives us a good starting point for the next possible model.

With enough data collected someone like JTH1 could start making a new accurate model.

# The Russel 1000

It's official GME has been added to the R1K, I believe I even read somewhere that GME is only 1 single good quarter away from joining the S&P 500, but I'm not sure about that (as this is from memory) perhaps a wrinklebrain can help out and check this out to make sure we are indeed about to join that as well.

Also good thing to note, I believe the Q2 is about to close at the end of Juneü§î wait wouldn't that be... heheh

# Fud campaigns

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8pk79/what\_i\_see\_when\_i\_zoom\_out\_shout\_out\_to\_uayyyybro/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8pk79/what_i_see_when_i_zoom_out_shout_out_to_uayyyybro/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

u/bah2o was awesome enough that they created a timeline of all the FUD campaigns we have seen up to this date, you can see the stuff they already tried to pull, it doesn't matter if these people who were part of this fud campaigns were trolls/shills/bots

The important thing is just what was posted.

Thanks  u/bah2o for giving satori some more food to process üòâ

# DTCC-011

Here is a thread about the dtcc 011, join the discussion and lets see if we can all form some new wrinkles.

My take on it so far is that the amendment was something along the lines of "cut off the foot to save the leg" kindof action, but what the hell do I know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# A pattern of memes

Good writeup about why certain stocks have recently perhaps been offering shares and others have not.

It could be (imo) that some stock companies are doing an ATM share offering so that when legal action does indeed come they can't say "well we couldn't cover" can now be met with "nah bitch you had 10 million shares coming out in less than six months, you CHOSE not to cover".

(yes I still hope they go after the SHF who do illegal shit with jail time).

# Possible Crypto Dividend.

Seems like we missed some stuff in the filings, thank god people like  u/loggic found this.

Give his thread a look they go over how they possibly could offer crypto dividend and other things my brain is to smooth to explain for.

# Insert bill and ted be excellent picture

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

# I'm Ron Burgundy, stay classy San Diago

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Again sorry for no pictures but reddit is not letting me upload any, keeps telling me they failed to upload -\_-

Edit 1:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9a2ty/dont\_get\_scammed\_by\_fake\_gamestop\_nft\_tokens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9a2ty/dont_get_scammed_by_fake_gamestop_nft_tokens/)

Because some people have pointed out that there may be some scammers out there, be careful with Crypto tokens, because unfortunately this is something that happens a lot in the crypto world.

Tomorrow we'll be getting a DD from our Kiwi ape u/Lucent_Sable on Crypto scams/tokens.

(seeing GME is offering a nft/crypto/token soon it's good to be informed about this so no one gets screwed)
