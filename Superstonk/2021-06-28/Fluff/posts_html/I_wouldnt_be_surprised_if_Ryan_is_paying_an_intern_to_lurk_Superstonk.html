<p>He's been a busy guy, reshaping a global company from the chrysalis of 2020 while simultaneously raising $2 billion AND forcing Kenny to work harder than he's probably worked in 30 years. He's without a doubt way too busy to surf reddit, even in the very limited free time I bet he has (30 min every other Saturday).</p>
<p>It would make sense for him to hire an intern to read Reddit, specifically this sub because it moves pretty fast. Read the DD, read the tweet analysis, read the discussion on the news, read the SEC filings, read the memes (especially the memes). And not only read it, but <em>understand</em> it, too. So this intern gets the same 6 month master's degree in United States securities markets that we all got, laughs at some memes, and maybe expenses some awards. And at the end of the day (s)he delivers a summary of the day to Ryan. It would be anywhere from 5 to 25 pages long, without counting the Top Ten Memes of the Day. </p>
<p>I bet this is Ryan's most favorite email every day. I bet he gets to it around 8 or 9pm. He probably reads it in the tub. Maybe he lights some pine candles. I bet he reads the "investor and customer research report" and gets butterflies when he sees us getting really <em>really</em> close to figuring out another piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>And if he doesn't have someone doing this already, I just need to know where to send him my resume.</p>
