I tried asking for more details and they just closed my support ticket. I'll try opening a new one. Does anyone have more info on this? They silently applied this restriction.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BTqHL6Z.png\n\nEdit: this is from last week at least! I made a post today because I just got their clarification response. Initially I was told \"GS2C stock is held by NYSE\" - what?! https://i.imgur.com/wVJo7pD.jpg\n\n\nEdit 2: to everyone saying Saxo never offered GS2C, why did the CS rep say \"not tradeable NOW\"? Does anyone have GS2C shares on Saxo?? GS2C is still listed (https://i.imgur.com/HqajZHu.jpg) and it only throws an error when placing a new buy order.\n\nCan whichever mod flagged this as \"inconclusive\" explain why? See the screenshots with the response from customer service saying \"no longer tradeable\" and \"not tradeable now\". What's inconclusive?",
