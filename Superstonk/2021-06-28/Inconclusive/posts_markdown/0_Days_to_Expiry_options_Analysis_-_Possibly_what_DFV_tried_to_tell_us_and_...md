Hi all,

This at the moment is a theory i'm plugging into my current working prediction model that successfully predicts the dates that GME moves significantly more than normal.

The next 2 weeks are a test for this theory. Please continue reading before you dismiss this.

I was looking for anomalous option data that i could analyze and try to fit in my current "T+ mover days predictions" model and i found a lot more than i thought i would hence why i'm writing this.

**TLDR:** Basically what i'm saying is, maybe i've found how the entire GME cycle works exactly but i'll need to wait 2 weeks to compare what truly happens vs what my theory predicts. If the results match, then yes i've figured it out.

At Mods, if you don't think the flair is appropriate, feel free to change it, otherwise i'm leaving this as DD because it is DD. If you look below, i'm sure you'll agree that the effort and research put into this and my previous work that relates to it is considered Due Diligence. This work is as theoretical as the MOASS itself, so let's not kid ourselves with what is DD and what isn't.

Moving on.

# 0. Test Success Conditions

**Test Period & Conditions to be met**

* Significant movement this week
* Significant movement next week

I know these sound vague as fuck, but trust me they're not if you continue reading this DD.

&#x200B;

# 1. Intro

I've been gathering GME's option data for the past 2 months now and analyzing it in whatever ways i can think of. Last night whilst in bed i thought it would be a good idea to check what the deal is with 0 day to expiry options.

These are options that are typically purchased on a Friday (hence why they are called 0 DTE / Days to expiry). Because 0 DTEs are typically super cheap due to their expiry, i thought i'd look into them for "fuckery" and generally just anomalies because i suspected that if a SHF/MM wanted to do something cheap, they'd use these.

Out of 2 months worth of data there was only 1 single point in time that looked out of place and this is what triggered this writeup.

If you've read my random postings so far you'll know i already have what i believe is a working model on predicting on which days GME will move. (Not to be confused with which way GME will move).

I've integrated my new 0DTE findings into my existing prediction model as they fit almost perfectly and by doing so, my prediction model suddenly looks/feels a lot more accurate as if i just added a big missing piece of the puzzle to it. It's by no means complete, but a i think it's a lot closer to completion.

# 2. 0 DTE / 0 Days to Expiry Anal-ysis

&#x200B;

**May 5 - June 25**

[List of all 0DTE option trades since May 5.](https://preview.redd.it/i46qnakb1z771.png?width=1656&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a9522e9c2784e00c704c8264bfd82137ca5cae)

Whilst looking at this chart containing all option 0DTE data from May 5 - June 25, i noticed what you've already probably noticed, a spike in the premium paid for $300 strike puts.

**Someone, on a Friday, bought $300 strike Puts (In the Money / ITM) for \~$29 million dollers.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

According to this chart, the date this was done was **May 21**

&#x200B;

Here is what all 0 DTE May 21 option trades look like & the specific trade isolated. You can see it was done \~25 minutes into the trading session.

&#x200B;

**Why would someone make this trade? For a quick buck? I believe not.**

I'm going to assume this isn't a yolo. I'm going to assume someone wanted/needed GME shares no matter what. Try and assume this person's mindset.

* It's Friday,
* He's just bought IN THE MONEY $300 strike puts
* He spent $29 MILLION on them.
* He bought them 25 minutes into Friday's trading session
* These expire at the END OF THE DAY.

Why would you do this trade? I can only think of one reason. To exercise these contracts and take the underlying shares for "Reasons". Incidentally, the amount of shares in this exercise is **200620** shares.

Now let's move on and take a look at what effect this exercise of these 200k worth of GME shares might possible have on GME's Price.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# .3 0DTE $300 Put Exercise Effect

Here's the chart starting from May 21 and using T+21 and T+35 as well as the T+2 settlement period to try and chart the effect of this trade.

https://preview.redd.it/a8uq7gic3z771.png?width=2444&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e353cdea9e10288f992403e5b17f3d4841ca9a

Welp, that was disappointing. You don't really see much (except them doing what they usually do at T+31 - T+34).  [u/dentisttft](https://www.reddit.com/u/dentisttft)  [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand)  u/keijikage You guys should already know about this.

That didn't prove very fruitful. Nothing to see here. **So now what?**

&#x200B;

Well, what other cases do we know of 0DTE option exercises?

Well, that's right. **DEEP FUCKING VALUE**

***^((Not exactly the same scenario, but close enough to be worth a look into and that's what i did)******)***

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# .4 DFV's 0DTE Exercise

DFV exercised on the 16'th of April as far as i'm aware.

Here's what his T+21 - T+35 cycle would look like if we included the T+2 settlement period in there.

https://preview.redd.it/dcs03dlq5z771.png?width=2450&format=png&auto=webp&s=afac85449f882bdc8144929cf641b36b0457c4e5

Looks nice and normal right? Yeah ok, let me show you what happened after in the next screenshot.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mind Blown**

Look at the T+21-T+35 version that uses the T+2 settlement as a start.

https://preview.redd.it/z78dx6i56z771.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&s=c81909fb8aedda3886b8902d0ad23e76da580bec

This blew my mind. I tried checking the only other known case of exercising a large amount of 0DTE options (even though again it's not EXACTLY the same case) and i found this nice coincidence.

Real coincidence? I don't know, but this is the kind of shit that jacks my tits.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# .5 How to test the validity of this theory?

Many ways.

1. Spend several millions on 0DTE options and exercise them, see what happens at around T+35.
2. Wait and see what happens for the 0DTE $300 put $29 mil 200 620 shares exercise from May 21?

And all we need to do is wait and see what happens this week, right? **WRONG**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# .6 GME 5 Mil Share Offering

As the May 21 runup started, GME decided to do a 5 Million At The Market (price) ($262 ish) offering. This offering sale duration lasted around \~2 weeks.

During those 2 weeks, we saw 3 LARGE downward and upward spikes. I'm going to again assume these are the effect of the offering.

Pre-read DD if you want to learn the method or see the proof etc:

* [Part 1: Intra-Week Max Pain & the next FTD cycle bleedout days](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxbonw/part_1_intraweek_max_pain_the_next_ftd_cycle/)

* [Part 3: Intra-Week Max Pain & the next FTD cycle bleedout days](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nznccu/part_3_intraweek_max_pain_the_next_ftd_cycle/)

&#x200B;

So, stitching my own already working theory for successfully predicting GME mover days in this, this is the result i get.

**Basic**

https://preview.redd.it/fuxhqjjh8z771.png?width=2434&format=png&auto=webp&s=453305da26f621cc8cbe67509dc3cc705bfe5480

&#x200B;

**Granular**

https://preview.redd.it/lcbe5s8h8z771.png?width=2444&format=png&auto=webp&s=1328656d5ace514b51bcf1bb9d4715bbb3bf9b15

What i understand from the above based on my method of predicting mover days is that:

* There's a lot of random T+21's and T+35's ending/coinciding exactly in THIS week.
* The May 21 Cycle $29 mil puts exercise T+35 cycle end is this week.
* Next week is the week where a lot of T+21's coincide and where the T+35 for the GME offering's START ends.

&#x200B;

So what does all this crap that i'm spouting even mean? I'll go in more depth in the next section.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 7. In Depth GME Offering Start & T+35

So, NEXT week will mark around 31-35 days from when the GME 5 mil share offering started. In my mind this means that we're going to see the **INITIAL** effects of the offering then.

In the subsequent week AFTER the next one we should see the more juicy effects of the GME 5 mil offering as that's where the GME offering ramped up and GME was able to sell most of their shares from the offering.

How can i tell? I am assuming so from the chart movement when we dipped from $340 to $190. This is similar to what happened in the last offering of GME so i believe it's a safe assumption.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/30ybr8a2cz771.png?width=2441&format=png&auto=webp&s=33ced552888f1bdb94a7e446d7c0ca0a765c7ccf

If you map all the T+21 and T+35 clusters that coincide in this week and the next week (as well as the Friday ones cause fuck T+0 settlement right?), they look like this.

Of all the cycles above, the absolute latest T+35 cycle they must settle their trades for this week is June 29. If for whatever reason they don't settle their trades (they sometimes do this intentionally), the trade gets locked in and gets auto settled the next day for them by FINRA.

I am personally assuming **June 29 or June 30'th** as big mover dates as a result from combining this new data & my already existing method of predicting GME mover dates.

I cannot talk about price direction because (in my opinion) this is purely up to the discretion of the MM/SHF or other person that is in control of this cycle. All i can tell is the approximate date that a big move will occur.

&#x200B;

Please mind you that i've already called 8 previous dates in a row correctly and have been posting about my predictions for a while in my previous DD.

These were posted a long long time ago and predicted all future dates. The second one is still in progress but please keep in mind it doesn't fully have the latest data i just found today plugged in, but should still be mostly accurate.

So yeah, here's the latest clean posting for this map. It doesn't have the smaller intra-cycle cycles mapped, but it's enough to get the general idea.
