I wanted to call this the "THANKS KEN" Megathread!!! 


It's clear to me that KG drank too much whiskey, and indulged in too much mayo the evening before he dreamed this little beauty up. 

This may in all likelihood become the worst decision ever made in the history of the stock market.

I believe the hype.

I bought X GME.

I saw u/deepfuckingvalue briefing the House Committee.

I've read the DD.

I trust RC&co.

I like the stock.



I am a happy ape with Diamond Hands.

💎🙌🙌💎

An ape who is happy to wait for a rocket to the  moon. 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I have gained wisdom from sh1tposts, and laughed out loud while reading DD about SI%.


Finally all that's left for me to do is to thank Ken Griffin for making a play that was so fantastically bad that I will never work another day in my life.

Thanks Ken, I'm planning to retire to a banana plantation just south of the equator. I'll spend my free time barbecuing tendies and  sharpening crayons for all the 4&5 year old children of the world, so they can learn maths better than your interns ever did.


We set the floor.

The 3 commas rule is official.
