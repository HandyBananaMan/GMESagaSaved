I think I know the answer to that question, GME and Superstonk has made weekdays I usually dread so much better. Once the squeeze happens I plan on buying many more shares than I can afford right now. 

The company will be doing exciting things soon and the possible dividend that will come out, God damn what a team GME has, Thank you apes and Gamestop for keeping me going the past 4 months. 

See you all on the moon.

Edit: removed the dividend date because I'm an honest ape and it hasn't been confirmed by Gamestop yet.

Why my tits are so jacked today (besides my love of Gamestop and their fundamentals)
