I'll spend my free time barbecuing tendies and  sharpening crayons for all the 4&5 year old children of the world, so they can learn maths better than your interns ever did.\n\n\nWe set the floor.\n\nThe 3 commas rule is official.\n\n ( $xx,xxx,xxx,xxx)\n\n\nTDLR; Hegies r fuk!\n\n\nThis is not financial advice. Please seek financial advice from someone is qualified.\n\n1,2,3 everybody\n...... \nThanks Ken!!!",
