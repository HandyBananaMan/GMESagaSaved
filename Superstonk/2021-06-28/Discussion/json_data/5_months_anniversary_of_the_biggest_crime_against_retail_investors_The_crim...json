    "selftext": "Who was pulling the strings on multiple brokers to ban clients from buying $GME and causing panic selling as well as margin liquidations? By locking out investors, brokers took away the bid for the stock. The market makers then orchestrated a drop of 371 points, 77% with ONLY 8 million shares traded triggering multiple trading halts. It was brutal, especially, when GME only moved 10-20 points on similar volume on previous trading days. A full comprehensive investigation is necessary. Also investigators must take a close look at what happened to the options during that time. These criminals should rot in jail.\n\nEdit: This video shows how they brought $GME down 371 points (77%) and also how they brought down the $GME options. It\u2019s a must see.
