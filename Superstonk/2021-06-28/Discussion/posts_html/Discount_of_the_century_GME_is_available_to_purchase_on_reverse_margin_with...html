<p>I wanted to call this the "THANKS KEN" Megathread!!! </p>
<p>It's clear to me that KG drank too much whiskey, and indulged in too much mayo the evening before he dreamed this little beauty up. </p>
<p>This may in all likelihood become the worst decision ever made in the history of the stock market.</p>
<p>I believe the hype.</p>
<p>I bought X GME.</p>
<p>I saw u/deepfuckingvalue briefing the House Committee.</p>
<p>I've read the DD.</p>
<p>I trust RC&amp;co.</p>
<p>I like the stock.</p>
<p>I am a happy ape with Diamond Hands.</p>
<p>💎🙌🙌💎</p>
<p>An ape who is happy to wait for a rocket to the  moon. </p>
<p>🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>I have gained wisdom from sh1tposts, and laughed out loud while reading DD about SI%.</p>
<p>Finally all that's left for me to do is to thank Ken Griffin for making a play that was so fantastically bad that I will never work another day in my life.</p>
<p>Thanks Ken, I'm planning to retire to a banana plantation just south of the equator. I'll spend my free time barbecuing tendies and  sharpening crayons for all the 4&amp;5 year old children of the world, so they can learn maths better than your interns ever did.</p>
<p>We set the floor.</p>
<p>The 3 commas rule is official.</p>
<p>( $xx,xxx,xxx,xxx)</p>
<p>TDLR; Hegies r fuk!</p>
