<p>I think I know the answer to that question, GME and Superstonk has made weekdays I usually dread so much better. Once the squeeze happens I plan on buying many more shares than I can afford right now. </p>
<p>The company will be doing exciting things soon and the possible dividend that will come out, God damn what a team GME has, Thank you apes and Gamestop for keeping me going the past 4 months. </p>
<p>See you all on the moon.</p>
<p>Edit: removed the dividend date because I'm an honest ape and it hasn't been confirmed by Gamestop yet.</p>
<p>Why my tits are so jacked today (besides my love of Gamestop and their fundamentals)
