<p>Remember what they did during the US Congressional hearing!</p>
<p>Ordeal Summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM&amp;t=2h32m25s"><strong>Here</strong></a> <strong>is a link to the CNBC coverage</strong> - 2 seconds - before the moment the video has a jump cut.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imRzHXRq80I&amp;t=2h37m32s"><strong>Here</strong></a> <strong>is a link to the source Government live stream</strong> with the missing 10 minutes and 18 seconds starting where the CNBC video cuts off.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM&amp;t=2h32m25s"><strong>Here</strong></a> is a direct youtube clip with the missing CNBC footage.</p>

</ul>
<p>Conjecture &amp; Hypothetical Analysis: Now, if this were to have occurred on purpose during the live feed, there would need to be complaints of an interuption in the CNBC live stream feed, and people watching have reported on reddit that this occurred. </p>
<p>Allegedly, if CNBC did this live, then, hypothetically speaking, they would need to use a staggered start in order to maintain a buffer and then someone on the kill switch. A combination may have also been possible.</p>
