Hello everyone, Since my very fist buy in GME the Market lvl 2 was really weird and still acting weird, And it's getting weirder when it comes to GameStop Stock.

Look at the names of these buyers and sellers, Not only NSDQ exchange will offer you shares, but also another a lot of MM can do the job! Nice right!

MM or any exchange in fact cannot create shares, but they offer you what they have, For example, if you're a client in NSDQ and you sell your shares there, NSDQ will offer your shares to another buyer, and MM do the same exactly, 

The different is MM they have pool of shares of almost every stock, sometimes they increase their stakes, And sometimes they decrease their stacks depend how they balance their portfolio.

Now, if you're a client in Goldman Sachs and you're welling to buy shares, GCMI will offer you the shares that you're welling to buy, so if you you wanna buy 5 shares of XYZ stocks it will appear as 5 XYZ: GCMI, that means Goldman Sachs bought 5 shares to you. this is the best example so far,

So if you understand the buy operation great, read this>> When you buy from MM any share you don't  have to expect they are selling or buying you at the right fare, in fact you're buying from their pool and they haveto apply a spread, and that spread shows the operation is fresh and clear.

Matching the spread: for example you buy 5 XYZ from GCMI at 200.0, GCMI might buy it for you ( in case they don't have shares in their pool ) at 195.20 and sell it to you as 200.00 + the spread. It's just an example and I don't mean really Goldman sachs, the famous brokers are eToro, RH and all free and discount brokers are doing the same. so These MM they work with these brokers, in fact your broker isn't buying and selling from Nasdaq or NYSE, that's why most of our orders won't appear in MBO.

Now the question is, if these pool are bought or just dried up, What do you expect from MM gonna do? well, they have 2 choices, or refill their pools and keep buying shares for their clients. But if they decided to refill their pool, there will be massive buying volume in the stock which will lead to increase in price and spread which it's very unlikely in GME case, because the float is low and price is high, if MM really did that dumb they will create a massive increase in the price which it might lead to margin call to their partners which will lead to another increase in price ..etc this action will create the reall MOASS.

Now let's talk about the MOASS...

GME has being played by many MMs, MMs are connected to each other, unlike retail traders. seriously, MMs they loan each other everyday in order to keep the market calm as they want, so if 2 MMs are against each other the game is different. someone is gonna annex the other, but also they are teams and as I mentioned they're connected to each other somehow. 

I will give you names of the SHF teams and you decide by your self.

And finally our boy who gives us the best discounts Citadel, as knows as CTDL and THEY'RE A  NASDAQ Participant .

All these guys are connected to each other somehow, and Market lvl 2 doesn't lie, I keep seeing meme orders by them as buy and sell, 

SUM IT UP, these boys are buying and selling in between each other every second, the 100 shares you're seeing everytime is being traded thousand time everyday. THIS IS A PRICE MANIPULATION.

To create a real MOASS the pools must be dried up to prevent 2 things:

1st Borrow, pools provide borrowable shares everyday.

2nd: prevent MM to sells or buys you shares at very different rate

If the buying power remain steady the pools will be dried at some point, if that happen somehow no official report needed, you'll see the spread is increasing too much in NSDQ exchange, and the volatility will be even wider that ever, 

Attention, Volatility is too sensitive, a little sell could make -30% in matter of second but without volume. this you see a Dip without a volume it means this is regular volatility and the price will go up soon, for example: GME current price 200 then dipped to 150 with volume only 200k or less it means there's no real selling and it's a volatility caused by lack of shares.

Soon or later when we reach this point, SHF won't be able to short because there will be no pool to borrow, and the volatility will work against them, any small buying order will increase the price quickly.

After this point I think there will be no point but to close the short position and start the MOASS, the escape key is melted the all these connected MM will fall apart one by one

At last; I'm not a financial advisor and this is not an advice, buy at your own research. I just like this stock, and if I'm a financial advisor I'd probably shorting right now (LOL) just a joke.

Thanks for reading, Ralph was here, Peace and OUT.
