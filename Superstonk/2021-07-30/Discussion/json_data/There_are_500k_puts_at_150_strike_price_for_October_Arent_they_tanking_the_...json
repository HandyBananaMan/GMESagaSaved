Isn't sus that they are tanking the price to 150 these 3 weeks for them to exercise, somehow, 50million shares, or the equivalent in money by trading the contract?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey are 10 dollars away from reaching it, right?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSource of the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otzu3e/posting_some_more_info_to_help_wrinkle_brains/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*edit: For visibility.

Tanking the price also means they may prevent GME from going to the S&P 500 due to the market cap. Gonna read on it.*",
