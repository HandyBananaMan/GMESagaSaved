# Title: We're in a psychological waiting game. The DD is solid. The walls are closing in on the SHFs. Our focus now needs to be on strengthening our mindset and maintaining our emotions in this situation. Learning stoicism is important for all apes. We can't control events, but we can control our response.

We've seen the [Big Short "Mood" meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ougv2v/mood/) of Michael Burry (Christian Bale) laying down despondent on his office floor as he doubts and/or awaits the impending implosion of the global financial market, all the while being threatened with countless lawsuits by his clients for recklessly investing their money on the short position against the US housing market.

He lasted for two years in that position. Hundreds of millions of dollars and his career and livelihood on the line.

Do you think that was easy? Of course not. But he remained steadfast and confident in his research, ***and it was basically him alone against the entire world.*** In the end, he earned his clients almost half a billion dollars.

We have the benefit of over half a million apes in this subreddit as well as likely countless millions more buying/hodling apes around the world who are on this train with us, lurking or not on reddit at all; hundreds of pages -- many books' worth -- of top notch DD by dozens of intelligent apes; laughs and moral support from memers; and the backing and encouragement of deeply knowledgeable industry experts who have been fighting against financial crime for their entire adult lives!

Not to mention a mindblowingly brilliant chairman and world-class executive team leading and rebuilding the company we've invested in, looking to transform not only the global gaming industry, but also technology and possibly even the operation of financial markets. I like the stock even if it *didn't* have the certainty of MOASS behind it, based on business fundamentals alone.

Learn to manage your emotions and this ride to certain victory will be a lot more enjoyable and easy. Take care of yourself. Eat well. Sleep well. Read the DD. Don't get complacent but don't let the psychological warfare of the SHFs bring you down. We got this. It's merely a waiting game.

[Here's a 5 minute crash course on the basics of stoicism.](https://youtu.be/R9OCA6UFE-0) It is incredibly relevant to our current situation: [https://youtu.be/R9OCA6UFE-0](https://youtu.be/R9OCA6UFE-0).

From the description:

>How can we cope with whatever the universe throws at us and keep thriving nonetheless? The ancient Greco-Roman philosophy of Stoicism explains that while we may not always have control over the events affecting us, we can have control over how we approach things.

*Edit: Meditation as a few have mentioned in the comments is also super helpful. I used to do 10 minutes most days of the week when I had more patience, but now I just do 1 minute some days, not even most (the lack of patience probably being a sign I need to meditate more, not less, lol).*

*Calm and Waking Up are two excellent guided meditation apps. Calm has a predominantly female guide (forget the creator's name) and Waking Up with a male guide Sam Harris, which is the one I've used in the past and I love it.*

*It's stoicism in practice to watch your mind and catch your thoughts running away with it, then centering your attention back to the breath. With practice, you come to possess better control over your thoughts. You'll never be perfect, but it's like having a leash on a very strong dog: your thoughts will still tug at your emotions, but you have a modicum of control to tug back that will prevent you from being totally knocked off your feet, emotionally speaking.*
