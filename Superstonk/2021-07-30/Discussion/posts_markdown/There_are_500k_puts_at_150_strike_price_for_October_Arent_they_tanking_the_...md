Based on the recent Credit Suisse post with 550k. puts at 150 strike price for October 15th, IN BRAZIL. Isn't sus that they are tanking the price to 150 these 3 weeks for them to exercise, somehow, 50million shares, or the equivalent in money by trading the contract?

They are 10 dollars away from reaching it, right?

*edit: For visibility. [The Chief of Compliance (Scarlatto) left Credit Suisse 2-3 months ago and there is a New Credit Suisse Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio from Portugal who conveniently knows Portuguese.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/12/credit-suisses-swiss-compliance-officer-scarlato-leaving-.html)
It requires more research tho... I'll keep updating it here...*

*edit 2: As some have pointed out. Tanking the price also means they may prevent GME from going to the S&P 500 due to the market cap. Gonna read on it.*
