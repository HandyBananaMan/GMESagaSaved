<p>Based on the recent Credit Suisse post with 550k. puts at 150 strike price for October 15th, IN BRAZIL. Isn't sus that they are tanking the price to 150 these 3 weeks for them to exercise, somehow, 50million shares, or the equivalent in money by trading the contract?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are 10 dollars away from reaching it, right?</p>

It requires more research tho... I'll keep updating it here...</em></p>

<p><em>edit 2: As some have pointed out. Tanking the price also means they may prevent GME from going to the S&amp;P 500 due to the market cap. Gonna read on it.</em></p>
