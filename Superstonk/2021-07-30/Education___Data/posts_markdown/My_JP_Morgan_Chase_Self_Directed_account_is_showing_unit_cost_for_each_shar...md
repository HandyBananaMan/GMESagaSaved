# Title: ⚠️ My JP Morgan Chase Self Directed account is showing unit cost for each share at prices it never reached on July 13th and 14th. I have trade confirmations showing I paid no where near this price for them. The same issue with Robinhood transfers a few months back. The well is drying up! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
