A trillion is a very abstract concept to basically everybody. I could say you have 3 trillion cells in your body, or that a trillion dollars is 5 Jeff bezos, or that a trillion years is 69.9 (nice) ages of our ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

But these numbers mean absolutely nothing. They’re so distant and abstract that the comparisons leave you with no more understanding than you had before. Instead, I’m going to try to make these huge numbers hit as close as home as possible. Are you ready?

First, let’s get some numbers out of the way to prove a point. As of the time of writing this, the [M2 money supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) (savings, checking, cash) sits at 20.3 Trillion dollars. That means the RRP is currently transferring *5%* of the total amount of spendable USD in existence.

Even more scary, if you look at the [M1 money supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL) pre March 2020 (they changed the definition to include savings accounts so the huge spike afterwards is just a technicality) where we only had ~$4 Trillion, *25%* of all of that money now sits in RRP.

Now, time to bring this astronomical amount to a measure you can understand.

Are you ready?

Look at your checking account, 25% of that is in RRP.

Look at your savings account, 5% of that is in RRP.

And that is true for EVERYONE!

That’s how big this is.
