    "selftext": "A trillion is a very abstract concept to basically everybody. I could say you have 3 trillion cells in your body, or that a trillion dollars is 5 Jeff bezos, or that a trillion years is 69.9 (nice) ages of our ENTIRE UNIVERSE.\n\nBut these numbers mean absolutely nothing. They\u2019re so distant and abstract that the comparisons leave you with no more understanding than you had before. Instead, I\u2019m going to try to make these huge numbers hit as close as home as possible. Are you ready?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get some numbers out of the way to prove a point. As of the time of writing this, the [M2 money supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) (savings, checking, cash) sits at 20.3 Trillion dollars. That means the RRP is currently transferring *5%* of the total amount of spendable USD in existence.\n\nEven more scary, if you look at the [M1 money supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL) pre March 2020 (they changed the definition to include savings accounts so the huge spike afterwards is just a technicality) where we only had ~$4 Trillion, *25%* of all of that money now sits in RRP.\n\nNow, time to bring this astronomical amount to a measure you can understand.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nLook at your checking account, 25% of that is in RRP.\n\nLook at your savings account, 5% of that is in RRP.\n\nAnd that is true for EVERYONE!\n\nThat\u2019s how big this is.",
