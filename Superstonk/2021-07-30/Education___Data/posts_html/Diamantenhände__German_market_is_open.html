<p>Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes around the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>Another day, another dip! This one seems courtesy of the Bloomberg terminals showing where the million Put options contracts were hiding, or perhaps Gary Gensler showing that he's got his eye on the stock we like. Either way, 77% short volume on the day is an incredible amount, and RRP continues to creep closer to record levels (and the ever-anticipated $1T level). Despite several dips in price this week, the MOASS Thesis still stands, the DD is still solid, and the Apes continue to own and HODL the float with Diamantenhände.</p>
<p>Today is Friday, July 30th, and you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>

<p>FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.18081181. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post.

<p>Many among the Diamantenhände community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler, following their sudden disappearance after Memorial Day. I also am worried, as I had tried to make contact many times and never received a direct response. Over four weeks ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the curator of the series. I've been serving as host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!</p>
