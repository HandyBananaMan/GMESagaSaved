    "selftext": "Think about it. The SEC has been absent from the fight for better markets for a long time and now there is a new sheriff in town. By participating in the creation of new rules via commenting and interaction we can be part of the solution. Shitadel an friends act in shadows, we Act in daylight. We should represent the future as we seek it to be. Be respectful and Gary Gensler will see us as an ally in the quest for fairer markets. \n\nBy doing so he will also make the Hedgies bleed harder and eventually cause MOASS. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nTLDR: Gary Gensler deserves the benefit of the doubt and we can be part of the solution for better markets. MOASS is only denied by bad players. Change for better markets helps MOASS happen sooner I believe.",
