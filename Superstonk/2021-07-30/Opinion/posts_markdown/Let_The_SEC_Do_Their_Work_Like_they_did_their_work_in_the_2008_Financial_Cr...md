# Title: “Let The SEC Do Their Work” Like they did their work in the 2008 Financial Crisis That Ruined Millions of Families. Where’s the accountability there?

Dear Apes, I am wondering what ever happened to indicting the rich and corrupt for their financial crimes in 2008?

Millions of Families were ruined and what happened to those who did this financial terrorism on American Citizens- nothing.

Apes already know the narrative is being set up to allow a Scapegoat just like in 2008.

Apes see the corruption that’s rotting the system from the inside out.

I’ll be patient, but I expect a repeat of the 2008 crisis- Scapegoats will be made and the rich will become richer.

SEC do your job this time around and quit visiting Pornhub on American Taxpayers Dollars.

Peace and Love to Apes.
