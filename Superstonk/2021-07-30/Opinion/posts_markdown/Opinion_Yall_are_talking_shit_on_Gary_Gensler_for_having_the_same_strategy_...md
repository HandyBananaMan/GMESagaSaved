Ryan's whole plan for Gamestop is don't tell the competition what your plans are for the company and prove your worth through actions, not words. 

Believe it or not, investigations take time. Investigators don't tell criminals what they already know. YOU also don't need to know every detail. Have you forgotten that Citadel is still continuing to commit crimes? They are building a case, its a simple as that. 

Conclusion: buy, hold, chill the fuck out
