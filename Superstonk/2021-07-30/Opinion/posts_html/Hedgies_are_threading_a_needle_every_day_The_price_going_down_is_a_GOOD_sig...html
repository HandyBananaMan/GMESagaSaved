<p>I swear I have not snorted one crayon too many.</p>
<p>Hedgies need to keep the price down below their margin call price, I think we all understand this concept at this point. If the price gets too high they will have to put up more collateral. If the price goes high enough that they run out of collateral, BOOM, moass.</p>
<p>But, recently, volume has been significantly lower than usual. This <em>should</em> make it much easier for someone manipulating the price to drive it downwards rapidly. Why haven't they just shorted the ever living fuck out of the stock to the point that it is driven way under $100?</p>
<p><strong>Because it increases retail's buying power too much.</strong> If the price goes to e.g. $50 apes can buy 3x as many shares for their money, meaning far more shorts, which means more expenses for SHFs, and more liability/exposure on their books. This will rapidly bring their margin call price lower. The lower the price, the faster we can eat into their upper limit. This is just as bad for hedgies as the price rising out of their control, because it will have the same end result (BOOM, moass).</p>
<p>A very low price also means GME would become a much more attractive investment for average Joe who doesn't really have a clue what's going on with this stock, but maybe knows that gaming is a booming industry. Maybe they know the company has cash reserves alone worth about $22 per share. Maybe they know the chairman of the board had huge success in his last venture (chewy). Maybe they know that chairman has poached a shitload of staff from amazon, chewy and the likes, and is staging a huge revamp of the company and moving it into e-commerce. Maybe they've heard this company has the most devout following of shareholder customers ever seen. Maybe they've heard about a possible Gamestop crypto being developed. I could go on.</p>
<p>The point is, if the price is dropping, it means hedgies are being forced to drop it because their margin call price is decreasing. They know they're not getting out of this alive - no one is selling. All they can do is drag this out as long as possible. </p>
<p>The share price is our clock. When it gets to a very low level or a very high level, the jig is nearly up.</p>
