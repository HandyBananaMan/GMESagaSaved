<h1>Title: “Let The SEC Do Their Work” Like they did their work in the 2008 Financial Crisis That Ruined Millions of Families. Where’s the accountability there?</h1>

<p>Dear Apes, I am wondering what ever happened to indicting the rich and corrupt for their financial crimes in 2008?</p>
<p>Millions of Families were ruined and what happened to those who did this financial terrorism on American Citizens- nothing.</p>
<p>Apes already know the narrative is being set up to allow a Scapegoat just like in 2008.</p>
<p>Apes see the corruption that’s rotting the system from the inside out.</p>
<p>I’ll be patient, but I expect a repeat of the 2008 crisis- Scapegoats will be made and the rich will become richer.</p>
<p>SEC do your job this time around and quit visiting Pornhub on American Taxpayers Dollars.</p>
<p>Peace and Love to Apes.</p>
