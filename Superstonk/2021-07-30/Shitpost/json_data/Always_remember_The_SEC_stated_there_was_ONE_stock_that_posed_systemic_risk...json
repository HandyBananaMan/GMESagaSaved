Let's keep it real \ud83d\udcaf.\n\nThe meme category is to group everyone together. Any time they need money a quick pump and dump with some meme headlines. \n\n\nThe best thing about the internet is I don't have to solely rely on colluding reporters and hedge funds articles, I can join message boards and research  availabledata to fact check these pigs.\n\nEdit: yea so no one reads obviously.

Thank you u/fewdea\n(To me they're all the same people. Imagine working at Burger King then quiting and moving to McDonald's.)",
