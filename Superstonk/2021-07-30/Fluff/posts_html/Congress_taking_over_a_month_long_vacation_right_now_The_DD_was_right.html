<p>As infrastructure vote is delayed, Reverse Repo hits 1T, and residential plan NOT EXTENDED, leaving millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes… 
I’ve seen posts and comments about the topic and I want to clear up that it is every year that congress takes about a month off in August.</p>
<p>“Right now, the U.S. House is planning to adjourn for a monthlong summer recess on July 30, with the U.S. Senate planning to do the same a week or so later. But a lot needs to happen before members of Congress can escape Washington for their home states (where they will do the fundraising and campaigning necessary to keep their jobs in D.C.).”</p>
<p>This quote came from <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/article/guide-congresss-summer-schedule-infrastructure.html">here</a>
.
I personally think this article has the perspective of a shill, screams FUD, and that last line in that quote.. “where they will do the fundraising and campaigning necessary to keep their jobs in D.C.”
….. that’s a crock of shit. They’re supposed to, but they aren’t.

<p>Here is a post about how much they actually get done historically through this yearly August vacation 😂 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/24/its-once-again-time-congress-start-posturing-about-not-taking-month-off/">The history of August adjournments</a></p>
<p>Only written about a month ago, I’m not sure how great the sources are and don’t vouch for them. </p>
<p>Basically the article is saying how historically they don’t get anything done at all </p>
<p><em>insert Ryan googly eyes pic</em> </p>
<p>They are scared to share their schedules with anyone, hmm, I wonder why..
These crooks have allegedly been asked to cancel this vacation, especially last year through the pandemic, and they declined. They consider it necessary 🤡</p>
<p>This vacation is crazy timing isn’t it?
Millions of Americans possibly defaulting on mortgages, that can’t be good for the mortgage backed securities can they?
I’m jacked beyond belief for so many reasons.- <em>The DD was right</em> is getting easier to say. 
I am sickened by this whole thing and the extent these banks and hedge funds are taking it. People are out of jobs and soon a place to live and it is sad to see. I will be so happy to help provide for my family and friends in need through this all. Be proud to be in your position and see this coming through the help of this community! Thank you apes for constant info!
We’re almost there apes🦧 </p>
<p>Please correct me if I missed anything or was dead wrong on anything. I’m just as retarded as the next guy.. 🦍💪🏽 together 🚀 🌙 💎 🙌🏽 </p>
<p>TLDR: Congress just went on their yearly August vacation, right as shit is hitting the fan in the US. Obviously buy and hodl. GME to the moon
This is not financial advice, my brain is smooth</p>
