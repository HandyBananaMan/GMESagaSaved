    "selftext": "As infrastructure vote is delayed, Reverse Repo hits 1T, and residential plan NOT EXTENDED, leaving millions of Americans at risk of losing their homes\u2026 \nI\u2019ve seen posts and comments about the topic and I want to clear up that it is every year that congress takes about a month off in August.\n\n\u201cRight now, the U.S. House is planning to adjourn for a monthlong summer recess on July 30, with the U.S. Senate planning to do the same a week or so later. But a lot needs to happen before members of Congress can escape Washington for their home states (where they will do the fundraising and campaigning necessary to keep their jobs in D.C.).\u201d\n\nThis quote came from [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/nymag.com/intelligencer/amp/article/guide-congresss-summer-schedule-infrastructure.html)\n.\nI personally think this article has the perspective of a shill, screams FUD, and that last line in that quote.. \u201cwhere they will do the fundraising and campaigning necessary to keep their jobs in D.C.\u201d\n\u2026.. that\u2019s a crock of shit. They\u2019re supposed to, but they aren\u2019t.\n.\n\nHere is a post about how much they actually get done historically through this yearly August vacation \ud83d\ude02 \n\n[The history of August adjournments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/24/its-once-again-time-congress-start-posturing-about-not-taking-month-off/)\n\nOnly written about a month ago, I\u2019m not sure how great the sources are and don\u2019t vouch for them. \n\nBasically the article is saying how historically they don\u2019t get anything done at all \n\n*insert Ryan googly eyes pic* \n\nThey are scared to share their schedules with anyone, hmm, I wonder why..\nThese crooks have allegedly been asked to cancel this vacation, especially last year through the pandemic, and they declined. They consider it necessary \ud83e\udd21\n\nThis vacation is crazy timing isn\u2019t it?\nMillions of Americans possibly defaulting on mortgages, that can\u2019t be good for the mortgage backed securities can they?\nI\u2019m jacked beyond belief for so many reasons.- *The DD was right* is getting easier to say. \nI am sickened by this whole thing and the extent these banks and hedge funds are taking it. People are out of jobs and soon a place to live and it is sad to see. I will be so happy to help provide for my family and friends in need through this all. Be proud to be in your position and see this coming through the help of this community! Thank you apes for constant info!\nWe\u2019re almost there apes\ud83e\udda7 \n\nPlease correct me if I missed anything or was dead wrong on anything. I\u2019m just as retarded as the next guy.. \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd together \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19 \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd \n\nTLDR: Congress just went on their yearly August vacation, right as shit is hitting the fan in the US. Obviously buy and hodl. GME to the moon\nThis is not financial advice, my brain is smooth\n\nEdit: format- mobile problems\nEdit2: comment reads \u201cOP please change your links, they are AMP: \u201cGoogle and the publisher that made the AMP page may each collect data about you.
