This is in regards to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okxio7/delisting_gamestop_the_recent_letters_between/\n\n\nTHIS IS ROUTINE - VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE A NORMAL OCCURENCE. \n\nAka, fuck this post. They wouldn't be able to delist Gamestop, it's straight FUD for something of this nature. These annual reports are already audited by an outside auditor. See their comments for the past annual report below: \n\n> We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of GameStop Corp. and subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of\n>January 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee\n>of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\n>respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal\n>Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\n>We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n>(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the 52-week period ended January 30, 2021, of the Company\n>and our report dated March 23, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nUnqualified opinions are want you want when you look at a financial statement. They are essentially a statement of \"nothing being materially wrong\". A qualified or adverse opinion is worse, and a disclaimer of opinion is worrisome because it implies that accurate information wasn't supplied to even complete the audit. \n\nNow let me continue by saying that a deferred tax asset arises when the Company's taxable income (for tax purposes) is lower than their book income (per financial statements or SEC filings, etc.) because of a temporary difference in the accounting treatment between book and taxes (i.e. timing of expense for book purposes vs. deduction for tax purposes). There are a variety of instances in which a DTA could arise, an NOL is just one.\n\nA deferred tax asset may or may not be utilized in the future depending on a variety of circumstances (this relates to the Valuation assertion of some balance sheet items). To reflect this uncertainty in the financial statements, a Company may determine that a valuation allowance to offset the DTA balance is required. Atleast one of which should be present for a VA not to be established:\n\n**1) Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences** \n\n**2) Future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards** \n\n**3) Taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law** \n\n**4) Tax-planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented to, for example:** \n\n4a) Accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards \n\n4b) Change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss \n\n4c) Switch from tax-exempt to taxable investments.\n\n-Should really only be evaluated annually as constant reevaluation/reestimation of the valuation allowance can be used by management to smooth earnings (the change in the deferred tax component of income tax expense).\n\nIn summary, the removal of a DTA VA means that the Company expects to have book income in the future to offset with the DTAs. This is all clearly surmised from the letters and annual report filings.",
