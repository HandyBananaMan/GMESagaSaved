Good Afternoon Apes,

Okay, so we know that overall the Russell 1k transition ended up being a net selling event for the ETFs holding $GME. In total the transition saw a total of 2,629,434 shares of $GME be released into the free float (Which could've been gobbled up by retail or other institutions). The one outstanding factor we did not know the day after the re-balance was Vanguard. They only release their ETF holdings on a monthly basis on the 15th of the month. So I calculated the total $GME in all their funds and found that while Blackrock was a net-seller during the Russell re-balance, Vanguard was in fact a buyer. Specifically they loaded up 366,000 shares of $GME mostly in their mid-cap ETFs. This makes me bullish! (As if I wasn't already). If you know the history of Vanguard and RC we know that Vanguard was a long term believer of RC and was and is still holding a significant position in Chewy. I think it's very important to know what institutions are on the long side of $GME.

TLDR: Tits are jacked! Vanguard has been slowly increasing the size of their position in $GME!
