Browsing through the fails to deliver data of the first half of June to see when we will expect GME to bounce back. I noticed that there are 105,712 FTD's from the 14th of Juni, which might give us some upward movement at T+35, which is at the 19th of July.

The SEC website however just released the new numbers, which shows a shitload of FTD's! Cherry on the cake is the 462,852 FTD's on 18th of June, for which T+35 is at the 23rd of July. In comparison, this is almost the number of FTD's from the first part of June in a single day! Next week will be interesting. 😎

Numbers can be checked here, but I do not recommend using a phone as I just did.
