I'm diving into the entire BlackRock report this time around guys so it's another late-night release, but I promise it's worth the wait. I think at this point we all know how much Black Rock is (likely) rooting for GME and retail given that they have a ton of shares. They also handle a ton of Retail trades. The thing is, I'm rooting for Black Rock for this reason. But Black Rock had some significant changes in net inflows and earnings (mostly good and some bad) this Quarter compared to Q1-2021. I cannot stress this enough. Black Rock has posted some significant changes, but looks strongest of all our friends. **Maybe retail gets a new friend on Wall Street in the giant they helped create at the end of this all?** Anyways, lets get this going.

**Edit #3: after many comments saying that BLK is not our friends, I just want to clarify that I’m using the word “friends” very loosely here and not in a literal sense. I do not view any of these banks or entities as friends. My family has suffered in many ways from the previous financial crisis due to the negligence and recklessness of these entities to make financial gains. They exploited and destroyed the market and were beneficiaries.**

**That said, BLK has the same interest in seeing GME blow up and we can find common ground there. Just like the US relationship with China when they faced war with Japan in WW2. I will be prepared to take on another front after this battle is over, but right now MY focus is on GME.**

***By popular demand, a running count of a net revenue for 4 banks Investment Bank and Global Markets so far: A NET DECLINE OF \~$90.43 BILLION Q1 to Q2 - 2021 (JP, GS, BoA &amp;amp;amp;amp; BLK).***

Next up on our road show is **BlackRock (BLK).**

**TL;DR: BlackRock Investment Bank saw a net revenue gain of $422 Million BUT Global Markets net revenue DECLINED $91 BILLION! Slumped to a net revenue of $81 Billion compared to $172 Billion in Q1-2021. A significant portion of this "reflect a previously announced $58 billion low-fee institutional index outflow related to a single client". I NEED HELP FINDING THIS INFO as its not specified and I cant find it ANYWHERE. I'm pumped for this one, so lets just jump in and see what we find and I'll get into the rest. Enter cheat-code(s): SHOW ME THE MONEY + BLACK SHEEP WALL**

**ELI5: In these reports I’m looking for correlations and trends. In summary, it seems like all institutions are doing okay with investment banking but losing massively in global markets.**

**In general, I’ve found global markets are usually a leading indicator and investment banking is a lagging indicator.**

**What this tells me is that the global markets are starting realize stress from lack of trust, or clarity in the long-term, for economic and money market performance. While investment banking shows short-term trust by posting gains in revenue. Basically, it seems people feel okay for now but don’t trust the economic outlook**

Lets start with the good. **BLK Investment Bank** realized a net revenue gain of $422 Million bringing the total revenue gain to $4.82 Billion and is attributed to gains in:

1. Investment Advisory - $152 Million
2. Securities Lending Revenue - $13 Million
3. Investment Advisory Performance Fees - $211 Million (Fee growth was there 1st largest driver at 10% gains). Due mostly to their high-performing program iShare ETFs.
4. Technology Services Revenue - $10 Million (This is a huge 14% gain, and notable!)
5. Distribution fees - $29 Million
6. Advisory &amp;amp;amp;amp; Other Revenue - $7 Million

Now, the bad. **BLK Global Markets** realized a net revenue **DECLINE OF $91 BILLION to $81 Billion.** Lets dive into each portions contribution to the $91 Billion and find the outlier:

1. *Retail Revenue* \- $21.39 Billion or a SLUMP from $36.5 Billion.
2. *ETF Revenue* \- $75.15 Billion or a net revenue increase of $6.7 Billion from $68.5 Billion
3. *Institutional Revenue* \- This breaks it down into 2 sections: *Active &amp;amp;amp;amp; Index,* and is a **negative net revenue of $36.83 Billion.**

* *Active Investments Revenue* \- **$43.47 Billion A STEEP INCREASE FROM $16.53 BILLION**. This is the money that's actively traded in the markets. Big deal. **This is a significant 38% increase.**
* ***Index Investments Revenue*** **- NEGATIVE $80.3 BILLION!** *Is this real life?* ***DING! DING! DING! We found out outlier.*** **A VERY STEEP DECLINE FROM positive $11.1 BILLION! THIS IS HUGE!** Index investments are typically safer as this is considered "passive income" for investors and this is alarming. This shows a large number of institutions using BLK pulled insane amounts of money from the Indexes. This is a massive red flag for me. I believe it shows a huge disbelief in the market. Typically the indexes have been safe and out performed the market. This tells me people dont trust the market anymore, and instead trust themselves actively moving their money.

Posture check! Get your shit together because there's more. *BLK Global Markets Continued...*

*Long Term Investments Revenue* \- $59.7 Billion A DECLINE FROM $132.64 BILLION. Now I thought others saw large declines, but this is a **WHOPPING 45% DECLINE!** Reminder: Long Term Investments typically consist of Bonds. I'm assuming until I see the 10-Q, but I'm a betting man and I bet this is because of the bond market tanking. I mean if the Bond market wasn't alarming as it was from my other reviews, it should be now. This is a VERY telling trend. Not only did we just learn from BLK that people are leaving indexes, but they're also leaving bonds. Its not safe anywhere for the Bulls right now in the stock market. Not for long anyways. *They don't reflect this in their total, but I think it shows the continued trend among banks. So yes, I separated it on purpose and its because its not considered as part of the $81 Billion for BLK.*

1. *Cash Management Revenue* \- Down to a net gain of $23.34 Billion from a Q1 net gain of $39.19. Big drop but small in the bucket based on what we read before.
2. *Advisory Revenue* \- Negative $2.08 Billion another decline from negative $187 million.

Now that's 3 hours of my life I'll never get back until I retired with my 1 GME share. But I mean what I said, and I hope you think this is as big as I think it is. If it isn't please poke holes in this for me. I'm starting to embrace the Bank Earnings Guy (BEG) title, and my girlfriend hates it. But I think I love you guys more now. Keep posting memes and DD. The end is near!

Obligatory F in the comments for BlackRock.

*This is not financial advice and is just my opinion on what the earnings report means for BlackRock. I'm just a retard who likes to gamble and loves GameStop stock.*

**Edit #2: Found an excerpt in an article from their presentation (which I wasn’t able to watch): https://www.pionline.com/money-management/blackrocks-aum-rises-54-quarter-95-trillion-new-record**

**Looks like the institution wasn’t named but the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board announced they made a redemption of $58 Billion from BlackRock. Down in the comments folks in the military and other parts of government have confirmed this**

**After some research it looks like they administer the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), “a tax-deferred defined contribution plan similar to private sector 401(k) plans which provides Federal employees the opportunity to save for additional retirement security.”**
