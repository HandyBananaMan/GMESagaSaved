    "selftext": "Thanks to some awesome work by u/Suspicious-Singer243 at looking at [SEC FTD data](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okvtid/june_2021_second_half_failuretodeliver_sec_data/) highlighting when FTDs were extremely high, I noticed those peak FTD dates line up mysteriously well with the dates when worthless \\[\\*1\\] deep OTM Puts are opened.  It seems to me that this corroborates the theory that deep OTM Puts are used to hide FTDs.\n\nTake a look at this chart:\n\n[Timeline of FTDs, worthless Deep OTM Puts &amp; ETF Short Attack](https://preview.redd.it/kqb2bqjqpfb71.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db7ab1fcba6d18531ec502fcfa43c5eda97009ce)\n\nFTDs (in 100s to make the chart prettier) go downward in orange so it's easy to see when the peaks are in time.  I've color coded the local FTD peaks in red so you can see them more clearly.  The blue and green lines are when the worthless deep OTM Puts for March ($1) and July ($0.50) are opened.  You can see spikes in new worthless deep OTM Puts being opened that basically correspond to the red FTD spikes.  What's also amazing is we saw heavy GME ETF shorting on June 9th from [this tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/zionlio29288757/status/1402726869443698688) which also corresponds to a small July Put opening spike and also a huge GME stock price drop.\n\nBasically, the FTDs from 2020 were stacking up through Jan 2021, then they hit an \"Oh Shit\" moment where they came up with all sorts of shenanigans to hide those problems and kick cans down the road.\n\nOne caveat about this chart, the dates are a bit wonky.  The OI Change calculation happens after the fact so that data might be delayed a bit.  At the same time, the FTD reporting is by settlement date where that also lags a bit too.  In the grand scheme of things, I think these two lags more or less cancel out so you can see the bigger picture correlations.  (I know, correlations are not causations.  But I'll be a [monkey's uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey%27s_uncle) if if this isn't damn suspicious.)\n\n**tl;dr:** I think this time-series data is showing FTDs being converted into deep OTM Puts *and* shorted ETFs containing GME.\n\n\\*1 I defined the Puts as worthless when their delta at opening is less than a penny.  In essence, when the price of GME stock moves by $1, the prices of these puts move by less than a penny (if at all).\n\nEdit: The [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15btdyQ8b0hwdELYDTbwqAsbGmAKZPBW6jlHvIUgIM_g/edit) I used to create it.  The ETF line I drew on to manually since it\u2019s just one date. Data set used is the same options data set I purchased previously. (Am asked about it when I didn\u2019t mention it; and accused of shilling for the company who sold me the data when I did. Can\u2019t win. \ud83d\ude02)",
