What This Model Can/Can't Tell You\n\n* **What it can tell you:**\n   * **An estimate of the cumulative amount of shares ever shorted since 2015 to near present.**\n   * **An estimate of the equivalent cumulative SI.**\n* **What it can't tell you:**\n   * **How many (if any) shares were covered?**\n   * **Where are the shares now?**\n   * **Wen moon?**\n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice. I've put a disproportionate amount of time into this for free, I clearly do not make good decisions. Though I continually strive to improve this model it is, at best, just fancier napkin math. I am not an economist, and have no qualifications other than a long time math background. I just like the stock.\n\n# TL; DR => Low: 1.2 billion shares (1,665% SI); High: 2.3 billion (3,322% SI)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# PREVIOUS POSTS, if something doesn't make sense its probably in here:\n\n[Math Black Magic, Vol. 1: Why It Is Mathematically Impossible for Hedgies To Unfuk Themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw8281/math_black_magic_vol_1_why_it_is_mathematically/)\n\n* GENESIS POST\n* **TL;DR => Finance professor John Finnerty mathematically proves that it's impossible to short a stock to zero without naked shorting at least as many shares as there are outstanding, doubling the float in the process.**\n\n[Math Black Magic, Vol 2: The Limit Does Not Exist!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwy0oz/math_black_magic_vol_2_the_limit_does_not_exist/)\n\n* **TL;DR => Naked selling leaves a distinct price pattern and, at this point, the number of shares needed to short $GME to zero does not mathematically exist.**\n* 50% conjecture/50% Speculation\n\n[Math Black Magic, Vol. 3: Trillion Short Share Seance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nya5ps/math_black_magic_vol_3_trillion_short_share_seance/)\n\n* **TL;DR => I speculate on how apes fucked up hedgies' algos and make estimates of shares shorted**\n* **EDIT: the estimates in this volume are out of date.

In this part we're going to probably start violating the speculation zone. Reasons things might get a little weird:\n\n1. This will be our third and fourth iteration. Its very likely that my margin of error grows with each iteration of this process (one wrinkle brained ape estimated that I'm probably at about 10-15% error as of the end of last post).\n2. I will stick to Finnerty's equations and theories, but use my own conjecture to apply them.\n3. I will be using the exponential trend as price data (justifications in previous post)\n4. Past a certain date, ATM offerings would have to be factored in. It adds complexity so I try to cut off the timeframe before it starts happening. I want to integrate these into the model into the future but not now.\n5. Price drops get smaller and smaller, making it harder to identify the price drop pattern.\n\n# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Time Frame\n\nThe layout for this time frame will be slightly different. Originally, I had planned to identify the price drop pattern, do a normal 3 event shorting cycle, then move on to the next pattern.\n\nAs I tried to identify the next full price pattern, no obvious one presented itself. The only substantial price drop consisted of just two points. On top of this, they may overlap with the first ATM offering. However, I am at a woeful lack of data points so I figured a way to include them.\n\nThe full 3 event shorting cycle will be called \"Leg A\", and the 2 event shorting cycle will be called \"Leg B\".\n\nIn earlier posts, I point out what I call a \"scramble strategy\" in Finnerty's paper. This is when the manipulator is hit by an unexpected positive catalyst and must increase the magnitude of their short attack at time 2 in an effort to compensate. Originally, I said I was not going to use this scenario, but it seems to fit our exact situation.\n\n**LEG A**\n\n* Time 0 - March 12; P(0) = $264.50\n* Time 1 - March 15; P(1) = $220.14\n* Time 2 - March 23; P(2) = $181.75\n* Time 3 - March 24; P(3) = $120.34\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LEG B**\n\n* Time 0 - March 30; P(0) = $194.46\n* Time 1 - April 12; P(1) = $141.09\n* THIS LEG ENTERS THE SPECULATION ZONE\n\n# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Multiplicative Demand Shock\n\n>\"In economics, a demand shock is a sudden event that increases or decreases demand for goods or services temporarily.\" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_shock))  \n>  \n>\"...even if the linear demand is defined in a restrict production range so that the price is positive, with a negative stochastic variation of Y the positive price could become negative (a problem of economic consistency). In order to prevent this, **one alternative is to consider a multiplicative demand shock...**  \n>  \n>\"**A good feature of multiplicative demand shocks, that is, P = Y \\* k, where k can be a deterministic demand function**, that is: if Y follow a GBM then the price P also follows a GBM and with the same parameters like drift and volatility! The vice-versa is also valid.\" ([source](http://marcoagd.usuarios.rdc.puc-rio.br/dema-unc.html))\n\nI will be using this property in the last part of my calculations. My point in mentioning it is there exists a precedent for a multiplying a scalar or another function times your demand curve to simulate a demand shock.\n\n# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Variables & Equations\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mk013zdzfgb71.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd6c42d13394273dff9b5cb019498ddd078031b\n\n[Variables A and H](https://preview.redd.it/5rs7wuxjbgb71.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c0ea973a7a272dd579a2ff6853b7d2560d8705c)\n\n[Elasticity](https://preview.redd.it/3k4jpaotbgb71.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=74f8f4a627ef5f32f45ea54afa4a5d96acec479f)\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Growth Rate\n\n>\"Exponential functions are unique in that the growth rate of such a function(the derivative) is directly proportional to the value of that function.

The REAL Time 3 has yet to come.\n\nIn the paper, time 3 is the reckoning. This is when the true value of the stock is revealed and the whole market demand curve shifts. At this point, the manipulator must bankrupt the company or cover and close. That's it.\n\nAll the manipulators in Finnerty's model, no matter what the strategy they devise, they ultimately can't keep time 3 from coming. It always arrives. In this model, it is a mathematical certainty.",
