    "selftext": "I had just gone to bed when something occured to me. I am typing this idea on my phone and would love some input.\n\n________\n\nThis hypothesis is an attempt at explaining the current downward price trend, and why it may signal that the battle is nearly won. It also theorizes that shorts may have inadvertently shown their hand.\n\n_______\n\n**\"For shorts to stay short and keep shorting, the price must fall\"**\n\nThis thought rung inside my head for a few minutes after laying down.\n\n\nFor the last few days we've seen an almost linear downward turn of the price. This is counterintuitive, as apes have been buying.\n\nMy theory is that shortsellers are running out of leverage, and fast. Apes keep buying, the short interest keeps growing... and they can't close. This leaves one option.\n\nWe already presumed shortsellers (Citadel) could control the price by routing buy orders through dark pools and filling them with synthetic shares, created through options(correct me if wrong).. what few people realize is they may be able to control it almost entirely, so long as they get to fill just some of them.\n\nIf they run out of margin, their only option is to reduce the value of the stock, by filling every buy order with a synthetic short, so as to eliminate upwards price movement, and thus deliberately lower the price.\n\nEvery share sold short adds to their debt.\n\nEvery lowering of price reduces their debt.\n\nTherefore, to keep their short within margin, if they want to keep shorting (which they MUST or the price explodes), they have to keep selling their synthetic short shares cheaper and cheaper, at a lower and lower price.\n\nWith this in mind, I present my theory that shorts are running out of margin, to the point where their only option is to increase their leverage exponentially, through naked shorting at lower and lower price points. \n\nThe price is exactly what they need it to be and this is their deathspiral.\n\nBut what's down there? Apes, more and more eager to buy the dip.\n\nIf their short interest doubles, they have to force the price down to half, to keep the debt the same. \n\nShorts have to sell synthetic shares cheaper and cheaper to keep their margin covered. The price is falling because... For shorts to stay short, the price *must* fall.\n\n_______\n\nAlright time for bed. Someone with more wrinkles, kindly critique or review how likely you think my hypothesis is.\n\n_____\n\n**Edit: TL;DR**\n*Buy and hold. Price will drop becuase hedgies will go bang if it doesn't, so they are forced to drop it artificially by filling buy orders with cheaper and cheaper synthetics. This is an accelerating pattern (deathspiral) which will make them go bang anyway, and probably soon.*\n\n*When the short interest doubles, the price must drop by half, to keep the margin the same. The more shares apes buy, the cheaper hedgies have to sell them to avoid triggering MOASS.* **If apes keep buying, hedgies are fucked.**\n\n**buying the dip forces them to make more and even cheaper dip, repeat till MOASS**\n\n____\n\n**Edit 2:** I sketched up a lil visual representation https://imgur.com/a/FeXKDdt\nWhen you buy, their debt grows, forcing them to tank the price by selling synthetics cheaper, to keep their debt in check. This lowers the price, **making GME move exactly opposite how you'd expect** a stock to react to buying and selling. The higher their Short Interest %, the more vulnerable they are to any and all catalysts (such as a dividend payout)",
