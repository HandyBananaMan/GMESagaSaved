So I summed up the [historical volume (NSDAQ) ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical) from January 4th 2021 to July 14th 2021.  The sum/ total volume was 3,284,802,823- or 3.28 billion shares. 

Now looking at the [daily short volume ](https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=GME) since January we can see it seams to have an average short volume percentage around 55-60%.  

Hereâ€™s an image if you donâ€™t like links- https://imgur.com/a/23os95v 

Now if we multiply the total volume by short volume (3,284,802,823* .60) we get roughly 1,970,881,693 (1.9 billion) shares sold short since January 4th.  ðŸ¤¯

Disclaimers:

1)  Short volume and short interest are not the same.  Short volume measures the number of shares that have been shorted over a given period of time, short interest represents the number of shorted shares that have yet to be closed out or covered by investors. [(link to short volume vs short interest)](https://finance.zacks.com/read-short-interest-ratio-5076.html) 

2)  MMs (market makers) provide liquidity to the markets. So if retail investors are buying a stock, the MM can fill their order without purchasing the security themselves, which will be marked as a short sale and reported in daily short volume.  Sometimes they can profit off this through [arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp) 

3)  Short volume is self reported my MMs


Now back to the 1.9 billion shares in short volume.  

If these were retail/ ape buy orders that were getting reported as short volume, than it would account for 65.6x or 6,560% of the open float (roughly 29 million) held/ bought by retail investors- since January 4th ðŸ¤¯

If these 1.9 billion shares were a mix of retail buy orders getting filled by MMs and plain naked shorting than the same point would stand. Shorts would need to get closed out, and retail buys would also need to get closed out for the books to be rebalanced. 

It is also my belief that since these short volume numbers are self reported by MMs they likely arenâ€™t fully accurate as nothing MMs, hedge funds, or institutions have reported so far has been very accurate. They do seam to report the lowest numbers possible tho, which makes me wonder if short volume is actually quite a bit higher. 


None of this is financial advise. Also, please poke holes in this if you believe any info is incorrect. 

POWER TO THE FUCKING PLAYERS.  BUY AND HODL. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€




Edit 1: Fixed link

Edit 2:  u/loggic had a good comment below explaining how this calculation represents the best-case scenario for us apes, and assumes that zero of the short volume since Jan 4th has been covered. So letâ€™s look at worse-case scenario. 

If we pretend that 100% of the short volume has been closed, than that should lead us to a total cumulative volume of 3,941,763,386  (1,970,881,693* 2)

If we now subtract 3,284,802,823 (actual cumulative volume) from that number were left with 656,960,563.

This would mean that the bare minimum of shares that would still need to be closed since Jan 4th- July 14th would be 656,960,563, or 22.6x the open float, or 2,260% 


TL:DR 

Best-case scenario 6,560%   (Of the open float) 
Worse-case scenario 2,260%  (Of the open float)

.... this also does not account for any shorting/ short volume taking place before before January 4th
