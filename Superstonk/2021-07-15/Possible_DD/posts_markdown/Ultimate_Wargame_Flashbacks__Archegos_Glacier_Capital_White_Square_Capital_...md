Also, if you want to better understand market mechanics and all the different pieces of the Voltron Fund, there is a DD floating around another sub called Gambling with Giants that’s a great addition to our collective DD. My hope is that some Apes will take the info in that post and put more pieces of the Voltron machine together. 

Finally, because of Reddit's interface issues, I won't be editing this post with updates, additions, and corrections. Those will continue to go in [the Ultimate Wargame FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blanderson_Snooper/comments/ojmgrs/ultimate_wargame_faq_and_cuts/) as well as be incorporated into future posts.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Today’s story is going to take us back to the Wargame Theory II, which included these two arguments:

1. Kenny has been hiding the true SI% since January using a variety of techniques to funnel the scheme privately between his “fortress funds” (my first inkling of what would eventually become Voltron Fund)
2. Kenny is obsessed with names that are evocative of real things but which also serve as metaphors for understanding what they do.

**Argument 1** above was incomplete, [as leavemeanon showed in Where are the Shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_1/). 

Did you know they referenced “tip of the Glacier” in those posts, which came shortly after the Wargame Theory II? It’s my story, so I’m going to believe they were trying to tell us exactly this. Or perhaps telling us that we hadn’t found everything interesting about Glacier Capital yet, which also turned out to be true. Both?

We also know Kenny’s been hiding way more SI% than what’s in the Married Puts, [as broccaaa and others have shown](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o14ccz/the_naked_shorting_scam_in_numbers_part_deux_up/).

**Argument 2** is speculation of course, but this DD elaborates on four names that continue to point to Kenny’s name games and how they can help us understand what’s going on:

Archegos. Iceberg Research. White Square Capital, and Glacier Capital

Future Ultimate Wargame posts will provide even more examples in excruciating detail. For now, let’s revisit three of our old friends and one new friend-of-a-friend.

# Archegos

Bill Hwang’s Archegos was the canary in the coal mine when news started leaking in March of its demise. In the Wargame Theory II, I suggested that Kenny’s obsession with names could let us read more than meets the eye into the Archegos collapse. It was the first inkling I had that there might be connections we weren’t seeing, and I hoped my theory of names would help us find them.

Eagle-eyed readers of the Wargame II taught us what the word *archegos* means in biblical exegesis:

https://preview.redd.it/pefd53xhodb71.jpg?width=885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=203da422fcfef485698030d8b297842275865038

(**Method Note:** Another user has since [offered another possible meaning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojh2eh/ultimate_wargame_theory_the_beginning_total/h52lveq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but the meaning in biblical exegesis is well established and so I think it’s a valid choice to make for this theory. Most words have multiple meanings, so the historical context of each meaning must be considered.)

It’s worth noting that Archegos’s portfolio, as far as I can find it, is 100% correlated with the Voltron Fund, but they are big names like Baidu and CBSViacom so it’s not a strong piece of evidence, more of a data point to keep in mind. I wish we knew the whole portfolio.

However, the fact that [Hwang is a Tiger Cub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tiger_Cubs_(finance)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tiger_Cubs_(finance)) and most of his Total Return Swaps were made with bad guy banks like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse, suggests the connection as well. Notably, Hwang is a vocal Christian, which supports the Biblical interpretation of his fund’s name.

In Ultimate Wargame: Beginnings, I speculated that Archegos’s meltdown might be reflected in the March GME event and be a clue to understanding this year’s RRP action. Its name was an important piece of speculation that informed the theory, so **I’ll repeat the theory here**.

&#x200B;

* The shorts got hidden in January by the Married Puts and other mechanisms we have since identified, but that’s the last time that was going to happen on that scale
* The Voltron’s Sword algorithm determines that someone needs to go, and so Archegos (“the first, the sacrifice”) gets the call and that causes the March run-up
* While they’re waiting for the Archegos fallout to appear, the Voltron Fund fragments its holdings and prepares to use a series of Total Return Swaps to keep the price under control when it shoots up as a result (similar to how they shut down January, but through a different mechanism)
* Right after that, in mid-March, is when RRPs start to rumble and they’ve been basically growing ever since, as the TRS’s leak more and more cash into their counterparty banks. By sacrificing Archegos and keeping the price steady, they have been able to draw out the charade much longer
* They keep the price flat and money flowing through HFT shenanigans between members, and they keep the shorts hidden using TRS swaps and non-reporting family funds

This would explain the low borrow rate and reports that they are low because there is no interest in borrowing GME. They have been borrowing and shorting as part of the strategy, but the main thing keeping them alive is spreading massive leverage over trillions of dollars AUM and dozens of companies so that every company in the fund is at least $0.01 in the black. 

They're mostly using their own shares to manipulate the price, it's just that before we didn't know all the places we had to look for them or the extent of the colluding counterparties. They will take pieces off the board here and there (Archegos, Citadel Luxembourg, White Square Capital) just to maintain equilibrium across the entire fund. I believe the May run-up *might* have been a result of Citadel Luxembourg closing and Glacier Capital absorbing some of its positions. 

 Let’s take a look.

# Revisiting the Glacier

A couple of weeks ago I found two new stocks that started correlating to GME in mid-March.

I found them by revisiting Glacier Capital in light of the emergence of Iceberg Research and identification of the Voltron Fund. I present this as proof of concept for the idea of the Voltron Fund and how interconnected everything is, as well as how looking at old data with the benefit of all we’ve learned in the meantime can be fruitful. It also further reveals the extent of media complicity and coordination.

💎

On Monday, 17 May, Glacier Capital [publicized a strange letter to investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/neehh0/glacier_capital_letter_to_investors_states_they/), loudly proclaiming it had taken a short position in Gamestop at $167.

Investigative Apes immediately went to work to determine the legitimacy of the company and details about it. [This post made through Superstonkbot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o6otv9/potential_proof_for_white_square_capital_llp_not/) on June 23, which I just found while researching this post, looks like a prologue to the Ultimate Wargame. While their research methods go beyond what I am personally comfortable with, they proposed an idea that sounds an awful lot like the Voltron Fund:

&#x200B;

>I also have a strong feeling that they are using these companies to trade stocks between themselves, as well as tax evade, and execute any other illegal market tactics. I personally think there are many more companies to unravel and expose, with much more information that could help us out to see the truth.

Anon, if you’re out there, I salute you.

Then there was [this post showing the bullet points from Glacier’s release](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/neehh0/glacier_capital_letter_to_investors_states_they/) about their positions. I think it’s fair to say the community focused almost exclusively on their GME position, but we ignored the rest of the letter. We shouldn’t have. For once, Forget Gamestop! 🤡

&#x200B;

They opened new short positions in Fisker and “several other EV manufacturers.”

I don’t know much about EV companies and had never heard of Fisker, so a quick Google search found me a Motley Fool article from Jan 25 of this year.

https://preview.redd.it/7hybd29aodb71.jpg?width=1238&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10cdd5816656cd09386c8e2967679fc8497f0ada

I always click on their articles because they give me WAY more information than any other source, as you’ll see below.

Anyway, the first weird thing about the article is that the headline makes it sound like you’re getting Elon’s top picks. However, the article just briefly lists some facts about Tesla and Elon and then never mentions them again. Instead, they introduce you to *their* picks. It’s clearly meant to deceive.

Anyway, which stocks were the “top electric vehicle stocks?”

# Blackberry and Lithium Americas Corp

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j7nr5wrbodb71.jpg?width=488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e6b99e87f7127013dd769df2e418528719d39e

Neither of these companies makes electric vehicles (parts for them sure), but you know who has owned both BB and LAC for many years? 

**The Voltron Fund**

You know who’s owned Fisker (FSR) for many years?

**The Voltron Fund**

As I was writing the original draft of this article on July 6, a brand new article about Fisker popped up on MF!

https://preview.redd.it/w3eppieyodb71.jpg?width=1229&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=054dd7efef71533133e4f3fd54e975232bde0206

Notice that they also throw in another ticker, Magna International (MGA). You want to know who’s recently taken a big(ger) interest in MGA?

**The Voltron Fund**

You might say they just pick winners, I say they arbitrarily make and break them.

💎

Back to the Glacier and its home, Luxembourg.

I have two theories:

* Glacier absorbed some or all of Citadel Luxembourg’s positions through the machinations of the Voltron Fund. 
* In doing so, they have correlated new stocks to GME, similar to [what we had found in The Big Four](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nay4zw/presenting_the_big_four_four_separate_stocks_four/).

Let's see what we can find.

Citadel Luxembourg closed its doors on April 30. Glacier announced its short position on May 17. It must have taken a few days to write that letter to investors, so I figured I’d look at the stock movements to see if we can find evidence of Glacier taking on Citadel Luxembourg’s positions.

Why not start with LAC and FSR?

Here’s a comparison of the monthly charts for FSR, LAC, and GME. My pet frog ate some mushrooms and labeled the charts, total psycho when he's tripping. 🐸👽

https://preview.redd.it/zjlgmybhpdb71.jpg?width=1476&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8ae51df3effe867dd31b24da71cfddb3e3c6120

Notice the volume spike at the end of April? I speculate that this is Glacier Capital absorbing all of Citadel Luxembourg’s positions.

All three stocks get dumped on May 10th and then begin a run-up all the way to the date of GME’s annual meeting, including sharing significant spikes on May 17th and during the May 25-26 T+21/+35 crossover event. 

Remember what happened annual meeting week? GME took a big dump, and look at LAC go with it. But wait, Fisker stays pumped up there, it doesn’t dump.

We do know the Voltron Fund loves its pumps, right? Remember what popped up on Motley Fool just yesterday as I was typing?

https://preview.redd.it/qjs66v5wpdb71.jpg?width=1229&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df0cb2d00f9b50f4ef61f84410396015ef13f867

Pumping Fisker on the July 6, and on July 7 what happens? It takes a huge dump and starts correlating once again with LAC and GME.

https://preview.redd.it/jgxfl6ixpdb71.jpg?width=1520&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ada36fa34334b53390426971a48e8fb6326880de

Since I’m publishing this a week later, I took a look and saw that Fisker is still mirroring GME on the daily charts. Some days it seems to and others it doesn’t. Maybe someone can put together a chart?

Anyway, once you start correlating *everything* that happens in this saga to the Voltron Fund’s holdings, you start to understand how widespread the manipulation really is.

# The Widespread Manipulation Game!

On July 6th, someone posted the first weekly results of their ticker scraping bot on Reddit and Twitter. They posted the Top 10 mentions, I’ve highlighted which ones have been owned by the Voltron Fund for years.

https://preview.redd.it/3lo4x0q1qdb71.jpg?width=693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03861359c4191462c541f5de341eab65e735455e

They posted the 5 “Growing” mentions for the week. I’ve highlighted which ones have been owned by the Voltron Fund for years. Citadel itself recently took a large stake in Paysafe.

https://preview.redd.it/k5btgfy2qdb71.jpg?width=697&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e212f0fdd041afd27837679fe86770c53aa9a143

They even posted two honorable mentions! I’ve highlighted which ones are owned by the Voltron Fund or connected to its interests.

https://preview.redd.it/u4ncvgz3qdb71.jpg?width=701&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a97c2bd00e0d9eca19bac9e8029cda0bca2f1c37

**17 for 17, not bad Voltron Fund!**

But wait, there's more!

[u/ayyyybro](https://www.reddit.com/user/ayyyybro) has been [tracking FUD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnjqpw/dont_forget_what_they_did_a_running_list_of_fud/) distraction stocks since January. Every weed stock, the mortgage stock, and silver companies are all owned by the Voltron Fund. When I went to the Marketwatch article about silver in February, the only non-silver ticker they mentioned was, you guessed it, owned by the Voltron Fund. This is a pattern that repeats on every hedgie media story I've looked at. If Voltron Fund doesn't own it, they simply don't mention it, good, bad, or otherwise.

As I said, once you have this list, you’ll realize we are in a 100% manipulated media environment. No matter what choice you make, if it’s from those given, you will be a loser.

🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑🐒🍑

&#x200B;

One final thing for all you detectives to dig into before we move on from the Glacier. When Glacier announced their new positions, they told us exactly what price they took their shorts out on Gamestop: $167. Why would they announce that?

Let’s look at the GME chart from mid-April to mid-May, with the blue line marking $167.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/awjx1qhiqdb71.jpg?width=1338&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fab9cb8d941325dc080fe2ba5c9620edc21b222d

It’s hard not to see that line as significant, but I don’t know enough to analyze it. I see many times the stock bounces off $167, and I see clusters of volume around the end of April and May 17th, as well as a big red drop on May 3 (the first trading day after Citadel Luxembourg was liquidated).

Thoughts?

# White Square Capital

If you’re still skeptical about my theory of names, how about this?

Three days after newly elected Gamestop board member Larry Cheng tweeted this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0hb5yn2uqdb71.jpg?width=593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c501818111fecd9531ab8e6d8f2c06a196268e22

We hear about this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r8moghxvqdb71.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ef25265521396af0442958978d5d603fc7ca4a0

What has white squares? A chessboard. 

White Square is, as the Wargame Theory of Names suggests, yet another “name that points to a tangible thing but also acts as a metaphor for how Kenny uses it.”

I think Kenny saw Larry Cheng’s tweet and was like, “oh you want to play a game, motherfuckers?”

**Gamer Apes:** “[Yes, yes we do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ok8mf6/why_fud_attacks_dont_work_on_non_boomer/)”

&#x200B;

Now let’s check out a new friend-of-a-friend, and think about it as an echo of this Citron Research tweet about GME from January.

https://preview.redd.it/i8j2wjs3rdb71.jpg?width=756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=984f568900f8ff506217aff1cfc1aebb75b48227

# Iceberg Research

On July 2, Iceberg Research tweeted this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yi487xo7rdb71.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7873fe660aed54e1ff70a6ae10b0844263ee6932

When I first saw this, I thought it was a joke. I looked it up and found no SEC filings, and then saw a headline saying the company only had one employee in Thailand. I thought it was funny but dismissed it as a cheap knockoff troll copying Citron and Glacier's announcements.

And that shows I’m not immune to FUD, because they do exist. It’s also why I consider things so long and carefully before publishing them. 

Someone else did some great research and linked them to a building in Westerville, Ohio. Then, just like Apes did with Glacier, someone went and took pictures of the building and its tenants.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hnivvckjrdb71.jpg?width=747&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f159fd2ecca7bed700df00c64bf9cb80d612877c

Nobody’s home! But don’t worry, they exist. Iceberg is as connected to Voltron as Citron, and they and Westerville, OH are connected to this entire saga in the most bizarre of ways. More on that in upcoming Ultimate Wargame posts.

This story is all about names, though, so it’s worth pointing out that my initial research into Iceberg was flawed in another way. 

I looked them up as if they are a hedge fund, searching for 13Fs on the SEC site and didn’t find any. The difference is that they are a “research group,” which puts them in the same category as our old friends Citron.

On Jan 19, Citron made its infamous claim that it knows short interest better than “we” do. 

* Jan 19 was a Tuesday after a Monday holiday, and we know what happened over the next two weeks with GME.
* On May 17, Glacier released its famous letter to investors. That was a Monday, and we know what happened over the next two weeks with GME.
* On July 2, the Friday before a long weekend, Iceberg released its second-rate copy of the Citron “analysis” for the movie stock. 

I originally wrote this on July 3 and said “it will be interesting to see what happens to movie stock over the next couple of weeks,” but then I shelved this project until today. So now, LIVE as I finish this on July 14, I’m going to go see what happened with that stock. 

Well, let’s just say it hasn’t followed the pattern. (I wish those Apes nothing but great things.) Sometimes this kind of research doesn't produce correlations you're looking for, and I think it's important to point out those times too.

Here are a couple of other interesting correlations, particularly if you believe my theories about names and the Voltron Fund.

* Citron got blown apart by its pre-Sneeze tweets in January 2021
* Iceberg Research was incorporated in January 2021

&#x200B;

Also, remember the readers who told me icebergs weren’t glaciers, but were instead parts of glaciers that break away?

* Glacier was incorporated in 2017, Iceberg in 2021
* Glacier revealed itself in May, Iceberg revealed itself in July

The Glacier came before the Iceberg, twice. 💦💦

# Conclusion

White Square Capital, founded in London in 2016, is one of many speciality shops founded in the last few years to house significant amounts of specific securities for the Voltron Fund. It's a tiny one, making it a perfect early sacrifice, but also a simple one to track in terms of its membership in the club. 

Another author [posted a similar theory about White Square a couple of weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o5z8vc/working_theory_the_shf_white_square_that_just/), but I don’t think it’s as simple as Citadel taking on the positions of the busted hedge funds, in fact as my research has shown I think it may be the opposite. Citadel is the nexus and market maker for all of the other funds and their various shared schemes.

As this Superstonkster predicted almost a month ago,

https://preview.redd.it/kjpgwxwrsdb71.jpg?width=684&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8aad7e16ec0fd50350c4df11bbcf2b75cd0b0bb

&#x200B;

As for what’s going on with these stocks? Well, I’d say Glacier gave us a roadmap to understanding how any and all stocks they own might correlate with GME, and that the will push or pump certain stocks while shorting others.

**I think we can find meaning in correlating movement in relation to GME across the entire Voltron Fund over time.** But that's a big project, especially with my ancient research methods and Apeish tools.

If a stock was moving with GME and now it isn’t, but another one now is that wasn’t, what can that tell us about the mechanisms being used to hide the shorts?

I’d love to know what people with access to more tools and data than I have can find regarding these stocks. I also think there are lessons here about recognizing which stocks are pumps as well as understanding the arbitrage machine outlined in Where are the Shares? That’s for someone else, though, as I’m not educated in the mechanics of trading (although I aim to change that by reading the Gambling With Giants DD carefully).

I think they don’t care which ones we pick as long as it’s from choices they give us. The more money and stocks in their system, the more they can manipulate. That’s why I’ve conceptualized the Voltron Fund as a shadow economy sucking resources out of the real economy, because I think that’s functionally what it is. It explains why the rich keep getting richer while our roads, bridges, businesses, and civil society decay.

💎

What’s interesting to me is [this new discussion about a potential Gamestop metaverse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ok2e0b/a_castle_of_glass_game_on_anon/), which would be a true Reverse Uno card. **If Gamestop is going to create a new virtual economy, then maybe the MOASS is the mechanism for sucking all of the money from Kenny’s shadow economy into the new, better Gmerican economy, but filtering it down through the people rather than the rich shuffling it amongst themselves.** 

Here’s a prediction I made in the first Wargame theory back in April,

>Ryan Cohen’s endgame is to pull off the greatest magic trick in business history, a legendary response to a legendary opportunity that will be hard to top. \[He wants to be the first person\] to save a company by making its customers into millionaires.

It could give us the ability to define what it means to live in that new world, and rather than pumping our money back into the corrupt systems that got us into this mess, we can figure out how to make things better without new greed and old money getting in the way. 

Just a thought, but I haven’t had time to dive into that research yet.  

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**A couple of observations before I go.** Please don't get sucked into NFT scams, FUD, and rabbit holes...nobody knows any more than you do until Gamestop makes formal announcements. If there are scammers out there, the only way they can get you is if you pay attention to them. 

Distraction and division are two of the most common COINTELPRO techniques. They run their games on every post I make, and I'm sure the same goes for other DD authors as well. I talked about [the cultural power of our information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhx7f2/gme_apes_a_cultural_due_diligence_prequel_to_the/) and how to recognize and protect yourself against manipulation in my very first DDs, and it remains true today. Give them nothing, and take from them everything.

I also see a lot of FUD lately trying to fracture the community, lure Apes to private discords and other controlled channels of communication, cast doubt on the mod team, and get you to websites that can doxx or otherwise compromise you. Maintaining and defending this community is more valuable than abandoning it.

**At this point we are walking through a haunted house with the lights on, don't let anyone lure you back into the dark.** 

I want to end with a heads up: some upcoming Ultimate Wargame posts will be posted to my personal profile page, not Superstonk, because they are stories drawn from the data that go beyond GME and place the story in what I believe to be its proper historical context.

They are the story of how Kenny became Darth Mayo, and are meant to be entertaining stories based on real events, though they are sincere and genuine parts of my personal Ultimate Wargame theory. Because of how these theories have developed, I want to maintain a more distinct distance between the content based on facts and research and the content that weaves fantastic stories out of them. 

If you like James Bond or Tom Clancy, I think you’ll enjoy the next bits of speculative historical fiction. First up, [we’ll head to Seaworld](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o5ufp7/for_those_saying_white_square_capital_didnt/) by way of Catalonia and dig even more deeply into Kenny's supervillain weakness.

Coming soon,
