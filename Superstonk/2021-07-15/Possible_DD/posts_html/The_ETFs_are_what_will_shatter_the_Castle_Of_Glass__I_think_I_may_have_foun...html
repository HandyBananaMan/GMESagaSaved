<p>This is purely my own speculation, however I am making it a point from this moment forward to follow the trail of ETF's to bring to light the number of FTD's that are hidden....this all trickles down to the options chain....then to the married puts, then shorting...If you read that much then you already know where to look</p>
<p>Let me get one thing straight, I'm the little guy who has limited knowledge of where to look,  my research is on the piggybacks of those before me.....in hope to provide additional information.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fails To Deliver</strong> are being hidden the <strong>ETF's</strong> which is where the rabbit hole goes...IMO and TBH the research needs to look elsewhere at the <strong>ETF's as that's where the manipulations is.</strong> From what I have read from the <strong>Castle Of glass / Game On Anon</strong> there is a reposted to be <strong>5.6 trillion worth of common stock traded through</strong> <strong>ETF's</strong></p>
<p>The focus needs to move past Shitidel and other shorts, the trash talking, the memes, and pictures with lights on are all fun, but that ammo is having a less and less effect.</p>
<p>Finding the trail of ETF's is not easy as stated in the this God Tier DD, but the door is not sealed off completely</p>
<p>Now in recent news from the so called twitter leaks and now a different platform that is highly underrated LinkedIn....I think the momentum is once again on the move and the curiosity will organically bring more people into question</p>
<p>For anyone who didn't get around to the Castel of Glass here is the link again...I suggest you read it in its whole entirety.</p>

<p>I have mentioned these persons below in hopes that they can either approve or discredit the links below...that are again piggy backed from from u/leavemeanon was trying to tell us in his God Tire DD Castle Of Glass</p>

<p><strong>I think</strong> u/leavemeanon / MjB <strong>was searching here</strong></p>
<p>Here is a PDF from Harverd Law that has more information than one can read in a whole day...I believe it is here that the true amount of ETF's are hidden and from that a closer look at how many FTD's are being hidden</p>

<p><strong>Here is another of where it clearly shows that the percent of ETF's represent 36% of all Stock Market Trading back in 2016</strong></p>
