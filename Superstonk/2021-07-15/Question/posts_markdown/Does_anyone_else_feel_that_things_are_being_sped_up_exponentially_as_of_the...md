I’m sure that I’m just getting overhyped. I don’t know what it is though, it all feels that it is coming together and the burst is about to happen. A huge plume of smoke arises and all us apes see soon is a gigantic rocket that just points straight up. I know there is still a lot of ground to cover. I know there is a lot of people in our way. But I don’t know, something just feels “different” as of the last few days. It feels as if something is speeding the process up. Am I the only one that has this feeling of this speeding up?
