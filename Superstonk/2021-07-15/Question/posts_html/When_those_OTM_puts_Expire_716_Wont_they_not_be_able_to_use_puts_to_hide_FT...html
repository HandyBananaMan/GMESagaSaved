<p>Title basically. Is there an out here, or is it nearly impossible to continue to use cheap puts to hide their synthetic/FTD situation. What might we expect? Obviously coming up with a set-in stone timeline might be the wrong way to approach it, we are dealing with a creative force in the short hedge funds. They always seem to have an answer to delaying their FTD's/short positions. Eventually they will face the ending of the music however. </p>
