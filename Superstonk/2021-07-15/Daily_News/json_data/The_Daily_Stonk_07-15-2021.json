In actuality those banks have all beaten earnings expectations. Earnings overall are not down 40%.  \n>  \n>The FICC decrease isn\u2019t a crash either. It\u2019s indicative of banks tightening credit - likely at the direction of the federal reserve to stave off inflation and excessive liquidity in the market. Also bevause they know the near zero interest rates will be revisited by year\u2019s end. Borrowing rates for banks will increase in an attempt to tighten the M1 monetary supply. I think we should be careful about the information we spread. OP of that zero hedge post yesterday was spreading false information.\n\n&#x200B;",
