<p>At the same time they are trying to store money for safety at the fed, banks are down at minimum 40%, it's not a pure indicator of a incoming crash but its weird to see, especially with the huge inflation stuff going on, banks should be making profit hand over fist right now but they're down around 40%?Call me jacques yves Cousteau, because I think this is fishy ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>But... also weren't they also saying they had a great earnings year?</p>

<h1>NEW RULES</h1>
<p>So yesterday we had a couple of new rules passed, namely:</p>

<p>SR-NSCC-2021-008</p>
<p>SR-DTC-2021-013</p>
<p>u/llamaste-to-you did a small writeup on this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojm5ao/new_dtc_rule_srdtc2021013_notice_of_filing_and/">here</a>, with the links to the filings as well.</p>

<p>a DD on how the current Gamma and delta indicators are looking, I'm too smooth brained to understand it all, but I hope this helps someone form another wrinkle.</p>

<p>I have no clue on how to give a synopsis for this one, it's well written it looks great but we need more eyes on it, lets try to help the theory forward, poke some holes in it (if possible) and peer review it and see if we can help making this great DD even better.</p>

<p>credit to u/MunnaBigDicc for bringing this forward, it seems that the volume of GME may be lower now and still go down, but guess who is getting the shaft? you'd be right the ETFS!</p>
<p>it seems (by the looks of things) that the etfs are getting wash traded heavily(wash trading is High frequency trading, or Short ladder attacks)</p>
<p>As Papa rc's papa would say "buckle up" it can become a bumpy ride ;)</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>

<p>remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
<p>If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.</p>

<p>Edit:<br />
as u/sweljb pointed out I unfortunately misinterpreted certain information regarding the FICC, I've copied his comment here:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/">u/rensole</a> you need a correction about your FICC bank earnings in this post mate.  </p>
<p>That tweet by zero hedge is specific to the FICC fixed income and credit department of all those banks. In actuality those banks have all beaten earnings expectations. Earnings overall are not down 40%.  </p>
<p>The FICC decrease isnâ€™t a crash either. Itâ€™s indicative of banks tightening credit - likely at the direction of the federal reserve to stave off inflation and excessive liquidity in the market. Also bevause they know the near zero interest rates will be revisited by yearâ€™s end. Borrowing rates for banks will increase in an attempt to tighten the M1 monetary supply. I think we should be careful about the information we spread. OP of that zero hedge post yesterday was spreading false information.</p>
