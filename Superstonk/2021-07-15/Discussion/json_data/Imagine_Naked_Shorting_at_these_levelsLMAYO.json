No one is selling.\n* A dream team of executives assembled by a 36-year old wizard who already kicked Amazon's butt in pet food.\n* GameStop is debt-free and has nearly $2B in cash on hand.\n* Console refresh may be slowed by chip shortages, but it is coming. Everyone wants a PS5 or Xbox.\n* Taking on a fight with Reddit is insane. Taking on a fight against gamers is insane. Taking on both is a death wish.\n* Gamestop's NFT project likely is a game-changer.\n\nEvery short seller is a buyer eventually. Dig a bigger hole SHFs.
