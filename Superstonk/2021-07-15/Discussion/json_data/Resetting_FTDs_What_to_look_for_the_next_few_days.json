Over the next few days millions of shares need to be reset for hedge funds to avoid FTDs.\n\nOne way they are doing this could be through married puts. This is where a HF buys an ITM or ATM call and exercises it immediately. They couple it with a deep OTM put like the ones we are seeing expire tomorrow.\n\nThis has been flagged by the SEC as a problem in hard to borrow stocks. [https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)\n\nWe have started spotting these over the last couple of days. On Monday around 5,000 calls were created and exercised immediately and another load have been spotted today at the $130 and $140 price mark.\n\nIf you see ITM calls being created and exercised, try to screenshot the evidence. The SEC risk alert I linked above has a tip line.\n\n[http://www.sec.gov/complaint/info\\_tipscomplaint.shtml](http://www.sec.gov/complaint/info_tipscomplaint.shtml).",
