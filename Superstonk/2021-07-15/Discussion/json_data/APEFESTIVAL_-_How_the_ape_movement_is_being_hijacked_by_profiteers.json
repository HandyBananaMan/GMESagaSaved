Is. A. Joke.\n\nSome more shenanigans from the \"green laser eyed\" twitter people, pushed by the sticky floor twitter/youtube crowd.\n\nBut they couldn't just make it a sticky floor event, they somehow had to involve our dear unicorn tech/gaming/ecommerce future giant in their bullshit.\n\n[Obvious Sticky Floor using GME for relevance](https://preview.redd.it/zug6k86wmfb71.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=674cb96c5ee7795de74c32d48737929ec502381c)\n\nIf you go on their website: [https://apefestival.com/](https://apefestival.com/), you'll see that they are selling tickets starting at $150 up to a WHOPPIN $1000.\n\nLads - **this isn't the way.**\n\nBUY, HOLD. Is the only way. Going to an ape festival cashgrab that's probably going to be Fyre 2.0 isn't a part of the motto.\n\nDon't fall for this shit.\n\nEDIT1:\n\n[Need I say more?](https://preview.redd.it/8nac99g9pfb71.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=34e4fda3bdb13e40347f8e6f6a98290d95513235)\n\n[Obviously Trey is there](https://preview.redd.it/ctxnd19ymgb71.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc9ec1c40449603556ece4c32a657f38cc0fc8b)\n\n[And the tesco Trey](https://preview.redd.it/6w3bv6uzmgb71.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=8942a8afe9be5ce474f183e138a6ee30f0dd7332)",
