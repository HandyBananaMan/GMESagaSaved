<p>On top of that GameStop isn’t currently in the business of developing their own games. Maybe some day they will be but right now their main focus is e-commerce, tech initiatives like nft, and getting into esports. So even if Netflix does go full on into developing games Netflix and GameStop won’t be direct competitors.</p>
<p>This was the best ‘bad news’ shfs and msm could come up with and it’s a nothing burger. I think what happened is that many of us were pointing out that price had been falling for awhile in the absence of any news whatsoever, good or bad. So they had to manufacture something as supposed justification for the continued falling price. That falling price is of course a consequence of them short selling, not retail selling.</p>
