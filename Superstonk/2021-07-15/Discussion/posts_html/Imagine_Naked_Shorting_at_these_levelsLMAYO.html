<ul>
<li>81% Buyers to 19% Sellers</li>
<li>40M+ shares of OTM Puts about to expire at market close on Friday 7/16 (These are likely married to shares that are hiding FTDs)</li>
<li>Blackrock wants their shares back in their ETFs.</li>
<li>FTD kick the can game has been exposed.</li>
<li>A rapid Reddit community of 527K people that buy every dip and every payday. No one is selling.</li>
<li>A dream team of executives assembled by a 36-year old wizard who already kicked Amazon's butt in pet food.</li>
<li>GameStop is debt-free and has nearly $2B in cash on hand.</li>
<li>Console refresh may be slowed by chip shortages, but it is coming. Everyone wants a PS5 or Xbox.</li>
<li>Taking on a fight with Reddit is insane. Taking on a fight against gamers is insane. Taking on both is a death wish.</li>
<li>Gamestop's NFT project likely is a game-changer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every short seller is a buyer eventually. Dig a bigger hole SHFs. This ends one way only.</p>
