Alright lads, I have something I need to get off my chest.

# This. Is. A. Joke.

Some more shenanigans from the "green laser eyed" twitter people, pushed by the sticky floor twitter/youtube crowd.

But they couldn't just make it a sticky floor event, they somehow had to involve our dear unicorn tech/gaming/ecommerce future giant in their bullshit.

If you go on their website: [https://apefestival.com/](https://apefestival.com/), you'll see that they are selling tickets starting at $150 up to a WHOPPIN $1000.

Lads - **this isn't the way.**

BUY, HOLD. Is the only way. Going to an ape festival cashgrab that's probably going to be Fyre 2.0 isn't a part of the motto.

Don't fall for this shit.
