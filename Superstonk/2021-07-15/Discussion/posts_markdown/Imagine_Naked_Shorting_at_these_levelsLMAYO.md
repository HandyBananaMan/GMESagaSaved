* 81% Buyers to 19% Sellers
* 40M+ shares of OTM Puts about to expire at market close on Friday 7/16 (These are likely married to shares that are hiding FTDs)
* Blackrock wants their shares back in their ETFs.
* FTD kick the can game has been exposed.
* A rapid Reddit community of 527K people that buy every dip and every payday. No one is selling.
* A dream team of executives assembled by a 36-year old wizard who already kicked Amazon's butt in pet food.
* GameStop is debt-free and has nearly $2B in cash on hand.
* Console refresh may be slowed by chip shortages, but it is coming. Everyone wants a PS5 or Xbox.
* Taking on a fight with Reddit is insane. Taking on a fight against gamers is insane. Taking on both is a death wish.
* Gamestop's NFT project likely is a game-changer.

Every short seller is a buyer eventually. Dig a bigger hole SHFs. This ends one way only.
