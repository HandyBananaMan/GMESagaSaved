Let's take a look at how goddamn interesting today and this week has been.

Extreme price drops, far more than usual, with no one selling. Probably the biggest tit jacker here. 

Mod drama, again, and an alleged honeypot. Even assuming that no one in the mod team is a shill, there's definitely been some odd comments on posts about this whole thing. Red, if you're reading this please cast voodoo on Kenny. 

Apes have taken to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6820936906419920896/) of all fucking places to discuss GME. MOASS discussion is now being associated with real people, quite a lot of which are involved in the finance industry if you look at the jobs of the folks commenting. 

The Castle of Glass DD and the return of u/leavemeanon in the form of u/leavemeanon2 is also tit jacking. If you think his second account is a fake, then it's pretty telling that they'd have a shill bother to do this and fake a verification with u/rensole.

Regardless of price, this week is a massive victory and it's only Wednesday. Not because of what's happened, but because we know damn well now more than ever we're on the right track and it's potentially close.

Probably gonna end my night with some Rocket League, stay up till dawn and sleep through market open. Tits jacked to see what new adventures tomorrow will have happened by the time I wake up.  Buying and holding has never been easier.
