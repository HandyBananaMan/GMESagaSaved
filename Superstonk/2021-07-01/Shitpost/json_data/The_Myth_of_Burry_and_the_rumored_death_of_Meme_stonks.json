    "selftext": "Had Burry sold his GME stake today, on a multi-week slow dip after a 5 mil ATM, he would have 10X more profit ( at least ! ) from the trade.\n\nThe guy is smart and looks at things differently but he has a particular brand of tunnel vision that ignores anything outside his direct calculation. In other words, he is a binary thinker.\n\nHe sold GME because it made him lots of money. He saw the early value, argued for it, saw his thesis was correct and exited the trade even though new information became available and was visible to MANY. The guy is inflexible and his arrogance drastically reduces his performance.\n\nFor perspective, Scion has less than $400 mil under management, his GME trade was worth about  $270 mil He sold around this $18 and purchased around $4. Had he sold TODAY, the trade would be worth 3 billion!!!! I mean, sure. he made a fantastic profit. But he could have pulled out 6x more profit on GME than he did in the 2008 collapse bet. Hell, he could have sold at $400 per share and had almost 6 billion profit.\n\nSo, he was correct about 2008 but WAY early. This cost him a ton. He paid lots of fees to hold that trade until it was viable. His poor timing ( relative, he was still correct) cost him on both sides of the deal. His clients forced him to sell early because he entered the trade much too early.\n\nHow much value should we place on Burry's ranting? If your answer was anywhere near \"none\" you would be correct. Burry is known because Christian Bale is a phenomenal actor and the Big Short was a good film about a fucked up time that we all remember.\n\nI personally think Burry is just another narcissistic trader, no more, no less.\n\nThat said, I agree with Burry that a Meme stock collapse is imminent. The lack of capital inflow and a spreading out of reddit mentioned pumps, our collective resources are essentially absorbed by the market and Reddit investors as a whole have mostly lost their impact. \n\nLucky for us, GME is no longer a meme. we have fallen from the public eye, other subs have moved on. What we have is a true turnaround value play with a much more resilient squeeze play that can erupt into MOASS at any moment due to the years of price manipulation and FTDs. \n\nIs Burry correct about the impending crash? Sure. He is not a lone voice in the wilderness on this. Are his postulations of any value to us? Nope. Not a bit. He likes riddles. Cryptic warnings are great for sparking discussion but of no actionable value. More of a drama queen than a brilliant maverick.\n\nSo Burry, if you read this, thanks for pointing us in the direction of GME, too bad about those Portnoy hands. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TADR**: *A mediocre trader made famous by the right trade at the wrong time and a great film lectures us about meme stocks and the market even though his trades are poorly timed.*",
