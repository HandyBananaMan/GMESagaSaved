<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>GME is a massive powder keg about to explode.  Curious?  Read on to find out more...</p>
<p>A very reliable technical indicator created by Rocky Outcrop is flashing a rare signal that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Full credit goes to Rocky Outcrop and Trade Spotting for creating this custom DMI indicator and sharing it with the masses.</strong></p>
<h1>TLDR</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Directional Movement Index (DMI) started flashing a powder keg signal on June 29th.  This signal has only flashed three other times in all of 2021</li>
<li>The ignition source of the signal (the ADX line) is at it's fourth lowest point <strong>since 2018</strong>.  The lower the ADX goes, the more certain we can be of a near-future run-up</li>
<li>When the powder keg explodes, expect volatility and momentum to <strong>skyrocket</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1>DMI</h1>
<p>The Directional Movement Index (or DMI for short) is a technical indicator made up of three components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DI+</strong>: This shows the current momentum of positive price movement.  This is shown in <strong>YELLOW</strong> on my charts below</li>
<li><strong>DI-</strong>: This shows the current momentum of negative price movement.  This is shown in <strong>PINK</strong> on my charts below</li>
<li><strong>ADX</strong> (Average Directional Index):  This shows the <em>strength</em> of the current price movement.  This is shown in <strong>BLUE</strong> on my charts below (crossover points denoted in orange)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The powder keg signal:</strong> When the DI+ and DI- lines converge (come together) <strong>AND</strong> the ADX line is simultaneously at a low point, the powder keg is lit.  This is denoted by a <strong>gray background highlight</strong> on the charts below</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the charts:</p>
<h1>Current Price Action</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/lklugrdlhn871.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4678d387e3ac1f692432e9117266407ce291cd1c">Current Price Action.  DMI Power Keg lit as of June 29th</a></p>
<p>Above shows our current price action over the last 6 weeks.  As we have been consolidating from June 9th, the DI+ and DI- lines have converged and the ADX is at an extreme low.  Notice the powder keg signal flashing (light grey box) as of June 29th.</p>
<h1>Historical Price Action</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/tsvvhn7mln871.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c88a922bbf50331713f897de4995ba44ac13a078">Historical Price Action.  Multiple Signals Flashing over 2021</a></p>
<p>This is only the <strong>4th time this entire year</strong> the DMI powder keg has been lit</p>
<ul>
<li>The first signal was flashed at the end of February roughly 1 week before our huge run-up from $40 to $350</li>
<li>The second and third signals were flashed together roughly 2 weeks before our May run-up from $140 to $350</li>
<li>The fourth signal just started flashing on June 29th.  This would indicate a huge move up in the next 1-2 weeks.  Run-up to commence from $200 to ???</li>
</ul>
<h1>Bonus Chart</h1>

<p>Bonus chart!</p>
<p>The ADX is the fuse that ultimately ignites everything as it shows the current momentum has stalled and volatility is ready to pick back up again.</p>
<p>Since <strong>2018</strong> the ADX has only ever been this low <strong>THREE OTHER TIMES</strong>.  The most recent low point is happening right now!  Historically speaking, GME is in a situation where it is ready to explode any day.</p>
<h1>Footnote</h1>
<p>For those who believe TA is invalid on GME and other SHF-manipulated stocks, I respect your opinion.</p>
<p>My opinion? TA is not the holy grail by any means, but it is still valid on GME.</p>
<p>Why? Because TA relies heavily on human patterns and emotions as they relate to stock prices. GME is no exception. There are still support and resistance levels like everything else.</p>
<p>Yes there is <strong>no denying</strong> GME is heavily manipulated, but that doesnâ€™t change the larger philosophy TA is based on.</p>
<p>Remember, TA is not a crystal ball but it does offer a glimpse into the <strong>most likely</strong> outcome.</p>
<p>To each his/her own.</p>
