<p>So this post is on the front page about 212 not facilitating transfers: https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/obk7qj/update_on_t212_share_tranfers/</p>
<p>So wut do?</p>
<p>If you’re in the uk there is one thing. It’s called the financial ombudsman service (FOS). It’s great. Banks don’t like it because it gives customers power. Banks will just straight up pay customers, depending on complaint, to avoid dealing with the ombudsman service procedure. </p>
<p>Now when do banks ever willingly given out money? </p>
<p>It’s because complaints procedures in finance are regulated. You <strong>have</strong> to deal with them. You have to have a formal complaints procedure. You have to respond to the Financial Ombudsman. You cannot ignore this. This is why banks and the like always try to just deal with complaints ASAP and rather pay out directly than have to bother doing the whole complaints thing. </p>
<p>The only caveat here is you can only goto the FOS after you have complained to the financial service, and they have responded to your complaint but you aren’t satisfied. You can’t go directly to them in the first instance. </p>
<p>So What UK apes can do is formally complain to 212 about refusing share transfers after a change in policy made them want to leave the platform. </p>
<p>212 will eventually respond, likely saying “soz no can do”. But That’s good though. It means you can goto the ombudsman. </p>
<p>Goto the FOS &amp; They’ll start an investigation. It takes time but they do it.  They’ll really start an investigation if they get numerous similar complaints… </p>
<p><strong>So</strong> </p>
<p>Do this. </p>
<p>Complain to 212 using this email - <strong>info@trading212.com</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you include the following:</p>
<p>complaint sent by the client shall include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the client’s name and surname;</li>
<li>the client’s username;</li>
<li>the date on which the issue arose;</li>
<li>the affected transaction numbers, if applicable; and</li>
<li>a clear and logical description of the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every 212 user should do this. </p>
<p>When they respond and say no, goto the Ombudsman and fill out their form here - https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers/how-to-complain</p>
<p>Ideally they fix their shit, but if they don’t then every 212 user goes to the UK FOS, it will cause a shit show for their compliance team &amp; forces them to, you know, let people transfer their own fucking assets. </p>
<p>This is the way. It may take time, but it will annoy the fuck out of them &amp; will lead to them changing this policy, one way or another. </p>
