**Edit2: the SEC has only published data covering up to June 14th. 15th -> 30th June will be published by the SEC mid July.**

I posted a few days ago about an app I've been working on, OP with a lot of details here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9ouq9/built\_a\_web\_app\_with\_lots\_of\_graphs\_using\_a\_large/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9ouq9/built_a_web_app_with_lots_of_graphs_using_a_large/)

I've just parsed through and added the new June FTD data from the SEC, if anyone's interested, take a peek!

Data goes back to 2009, and covers a variety of things - short volume, total volume, Dark pool volume and more.

Hope it's useful!

Suggestions, feedback and so on is welcomed.
