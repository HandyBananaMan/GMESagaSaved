Our Diamantenh\u00e4nde didn't falter, but I'm sure the number 210 is going to be remembered until at least Friday. Reverse-repos set another new record - $991b! And last, but certainly not least, RC tweeting sparked a sudden and intense interest in bricklaying and masonry. Bullish! Let's see where the German markets take us on this first day of July! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange as we prepare for the US pre-market to open!\n\n###\ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\uddf1\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 120 minutes in: **$213.80 / 179,53 \u20ac**\r\n- \u2b1c 115 minutes in: $213.71 / 179,45 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 110 minutes in: $213.71 / 179,45 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 105 minutes in: $214.09 / 179,78 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 100 minutes in: $213.94 / 179,65 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 95 minutes in: $213.94 / 179,65 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 90 minutes in: $214.03 / 179,72 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 85 minutes in: $214.30 / 179,95 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 80 minutes in: $213.94 / 179,65 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 75 minutes in: $212.52 / 178,45 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 70 minutes in: $207.93 / 174,60 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 65 minutes in: $212.22 / 178,20 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 60 minutes in: $214.66 / 180,25 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 55 minutes in: $214.72 / 180,30 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 50 minutes in: $214.69 / 180,28 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 45 minutes in: $214.69 / 180,28 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 40 minutes in: $214.69 / 180,28 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 35 minutes in: $214.69 / 180,28 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 30 minutes in: $214.96 / 180,50 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 25 minutes in: $214.96 / 180,50 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 20 minutes in: $215.37 / 180,85 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 15 minutes in: $215.64 / 181,07 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 10 minutes in: $215.64 / 181,07 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 5 minutes in: $215.64 / 181,07 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $215.70 / 181,12 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 US close price: $214.14 / 179,81 \u20ac   *($214.15 / 179,82 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie and converting to USD. Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.19089584. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.\n\nToday I continue testing of an alternate method of fetching data, using quote data from Yahoo Finance APIs to calculate an average of 7 German exchanges and volume. Those results will be posted in the comment section.\n\nMany among the Diamantenh\u00e4nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Last weekend, DerGurkenraspler appears to have deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
