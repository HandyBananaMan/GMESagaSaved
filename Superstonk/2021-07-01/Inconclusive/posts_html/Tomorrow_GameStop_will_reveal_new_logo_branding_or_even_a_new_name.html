<p>Facts: GameStop Twitter account just gone black and Facebook is dead gray.<br />
They want to told us that GameStop (old one) is dead and we are hours before reveal of new GameStop branding or even new name.</p>
<p>I don't know if any ape figured this out but I'm putting all my money on it. New king is coming!</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify why I said tomorrow.<br />
As and marketing guy I know that disabling official Twitter acc for longer than day may cause investors to panic so my bet is tomorrow.</p>
