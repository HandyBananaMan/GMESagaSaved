Facts: GameStop Twitter account just gone black and Facebook is dead gray.  
They want to told us that GameStop (old one) is dead and we are hours before reveal of new GameStop branding or even new name.

I don't know if any ape figured this out but I'm putting all my money on it. New king is coming!

Edit: To clarify why I said tomorrow.  
As and marketing guy I know that disabling official Twitter acc for longer than day may cause investors to panic so my bet is tomorrow.
