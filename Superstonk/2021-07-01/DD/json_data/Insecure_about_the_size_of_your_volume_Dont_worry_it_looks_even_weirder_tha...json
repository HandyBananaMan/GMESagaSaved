    "selftext": " \n\nHello fellow Apes! This is my first attempt at some DD, and is in essence more just me sharing my findings in the hope that a more wrinkled brain than mine can make some sense of it. As usual, this is not financial advice, this is just data I have observed from Yahoo finance - and anyone can go and check this for themselves if they want. **Warning: lots of numbers, not any pictures, I apologise.**\n\n**Preface: Hello everyone, if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll likely be worrying that your volume is too small. You\u2019ll be sitting up at night wishing to God to make your volume a little bit bigger so you can satisfy your wife\u2019s boyfriend as much as he deserves. Well I am here to tell you that your volume looks even weirder than it is small!**\n\n***TA:DR at the end***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 1: We are very special and unique and that\u2019s okay**\n\nWhile watching the daily volume chart throughout today, I was struck by how many minutes we experienced less than 1000 volume. More than 10 separate minutes today traded with volumes in the hundreds, and yet we closed out with a similar volume to the last 2 days, a little higher in fact. This got me wondering \u201cthere must be some real girthy crayons to average this out\u201d, so I sat down to look at today\u2019s chart. I instantly spotted that throughout the day, there were around 15 big, thicc green and red crayons scattered amongst the other pathetic wimpy green and red crayons. I quickly realised that each of these markers actually represented more than 1% of the entire day\u2019s volume, being traded in just 1 minute. For reference, there are 390 minutes in the trading day, so each should have an **average**  of 0.256% of the day\u2019s volume. \n\nOn a hunch, I checked some boomer stocks and the sibling stock who-must-not-be-named, and I found I was correct - there are **far more 1%+ candles per day in GME than in those other stocks.**\n\nSo I decided to work out the numbers properly, and post my first DD. Hopefully someone out there can work out why this is happening, and maybe the frequency of these big candles can be used to work out why large volumes are trading at certain times.\n\nTo determine which candles to focus on, I decided to concentrate on candles representing more than 1% of the daily volume, and also 20% under that 1% value as - without looking a little below 1%, there just was not enough data from any of the stocks I looked at - other than GME.\n\nSo for this DD, I will be referring to these candles as **Significant ticks,** dividing them as such:\n\n**Candles with volume >1% of total daily volume will be referred to as \u201cMajorly Significant Ticks\u201d**\n\nAnd\n\n**Candles with volume between 0.8% and 1% of total daily volume will be referred to as \u201cMinorly Significant Ticks\u201d.**\n\nSo, as I mentioned previously, boomer stocks have VERY few Majorly Significant ticks during the day. I started looking deeper and found that for these stocks, those big boi candles almost only ever happen within 10 minutes of market open/close. I checked the fruit stock and that other large tech one that isn\u2019t big or hard - and found that per day, they have an average this week of 0-2 Significant Ticks outwith 10 minutes of market open and close. So, between 9:40 and 15:49, only around 0-2 of their 370 minutes have significant volume.\n\nThe movie stock has an average this week of 8 Significant Ticks per day,\n\nWe, my dear apes, have this week an **average of 19.75 Significant Ticks per day.**\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the main difference between us and them is how many of our Ticks **occur outwith 10 minutes of market open and close.** Even with the movie stock, their significant ticks during the middle of the day is at an average of 5, so 37.5% of their significant ticks happen in the first or last 10 minutes of the market being open. I am delighted to inform you that we have an average of **13.75** significant ticks between 9:40 and 15:49. I\u2019m sure even the smoothest-brained apes out there can see that 13.75 is bigger than both the movie stock's 5, and the boomer stocks' 0-2.\n\n**Part 2: So just how much volume is in these fat, juicy candles**\n\nHere is where we, unfortunately, get to the numbers part. I have spent the last 3 hours going minute by minute through the last 4 days of GME\u2019s trading to get these statistics, so you\u2019d all better be grateful or I\u2019m telling RC on you.\n\nIf anyone wants the raw data I have put together to look at themselves, or to turn into fancy graphs and charts for visual learners (I\u2019m not skilled enough in IT, nor do I care enough at 2am to give it a shot myself) then please DM me and I\u2019ll happily send you screenshots: warning, it\u2019s an absolute mess that likely only makes sense to my autistic brain, but you\u2019re welcome to look.\n\nI have only collected data from the 4 days this week, I plan to do the same again tomorrow and post an update. I will likely continue doing this if the trend continues.\n\nI originally believed the 28th of June would have been an outlier as it had almost double the volume of each of the past 3 days, but to my surprise it fits in well. \n\n***DATA FROM YAHOO FINANCE***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Day|28/6|29/6|30/6|1/7|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Volume| 4,879,400 | 2,461,139 | 2,510,183 | 2,690,299 |\n|Major Significant Ticks (>1%)|15|8|13|14|\n|Minor Significant Ticks (0.8%-1%)|6|11|6|6|\n|Significant Ticks Outwith 10 mins Open/Close|14|10|16|15|\n|Total Volume of Maj.

This week, we have had **an average of 19.75 of these candles per day, accounting for 5.075% of the day's 1 minute-candles, but delivering 26.2% of the day's volume.**  Now obviously, GME is the target of large players who will be causing these volume spikes - these statistics serve to show the level at which GME is different from other stocks, and maybe give other people who are smarter than I am some data to play around with. \n\nAs I said at the start, if you'd like the rest of the raw data including when each of the Significant ticks happened and how much volume they contained for making new DD with, DM me and I'd be happy to share.\n\nSee you on the moon.",
