    "selftext": "\nI\u2019ve noticed that shills start off being slightly negative in the threads then they try to turn it positive, or visa versa. \n\nThey are smart and subtile. They lean on empathetic emotion then guide you in a different direction. \n\nThey are subliminally planting the seed of doubt deep then smoothing it over. I\u2019ve seen the pattern a TON as of late. Recognize the pattern, look for it and don\u2019t let the seeds of doubt sprout.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nEdit: For Clarification \n\nIt may sound like from the way I initially wrote this: \u201cif you question something you are a shill\u201d. That is not what I\u2019m saying. \n\nOpen discourse and dialogue with differing opinions is healthy - Honest questions are healthy. \n\nI notice strings of replies that are subtilely trying to guide people into believing that they are with them, but then dropping a breadcrumb that sews doubt rather than the \u201cthe stock is going to zero\u201d shill that we initially encountered. I\u2019ve noticed that the shills have become more tactful and aren\u2019t as blatantly on the \u201cother side\u201d as they once were. \n\nI have seen it frequently and I have felt it\u2019s impact. Just my opinion on the current state of shill manipulation.",
