I’ve noticed that shills start off being slightly negative in the threads then they try to turn it positive, or visa versa. 

They are smart and subtile. They lean on empathetic emotion then guide you in a different direction. 

They are subliminally planting the seed of doubt deep then smoothing it over. I’ve seen the pattern a TON as of late. Recognize the pattern, look for it and don’t let the seeds of doubt sprout.

Edit: For Clarification 

It may sound like from the way I initially wrote this: “if you question something you are a shill”. That is not what I’m saying. 

Open discourse and dialogue with differing opinions is healthy - Honest questions are healthy. 

I notice strings of replies that are subtilely trying to guide people into believing that they are with them, but then dropping a breadcrumb that sews doubt rather than the “the stock is going to zero” shill that we initially encountered. I’ve noticed that the shills have become more tactful and aren’t as blatantly on the “other side” as they once were. 

I have seen it frequently and I have felt it’s impact. Just my opinion on the current state of shill manipulation.
