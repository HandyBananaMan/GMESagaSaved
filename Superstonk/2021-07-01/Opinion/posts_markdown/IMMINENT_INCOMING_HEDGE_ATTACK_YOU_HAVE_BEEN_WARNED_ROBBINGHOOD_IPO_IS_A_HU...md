I’m not a a financial advisor nor do not take this as financial information
This is my opinion 


Robbinghood going IPO is a huge trap, they want diamond hands to short the new stock, however it’s all a manipulation

They will first let it climb to gather FOMO crowd and day trader attention, then they are going to make a fake squeeze.


Now there are new rules and regulations to basically prevent bag holding from DTCC/FED etc.
All with forced liquidation that they can “enforce”.


Put 2 and 2 together…


If diamond hands/apes short robbinghood, it’s the perfect trap, now with all the rules in place anyone over leveraged or whatever happens to short sellers then they fail, it’s going to force whoever shorted to cover forcing the sell of GME shares if any shorters had long positions,

Sec and the regulators will freeze assets and force liquidate just because you, they don’t cover doesn’t mean retail investor gets free out jail ticket, this is when they’ll be in full force.

Call it FUD, shill etc. You have been warned, but I see a trap coming from 1000 miles away I won’t fall for this one
