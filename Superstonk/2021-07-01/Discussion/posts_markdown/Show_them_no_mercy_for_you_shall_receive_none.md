Do you guys honestly think the bank or government gives a flying fuck whether or not you can pay back your student loans when entry level jobs require 5 years work experience and you just graduated? "Fuck you, you knew what you were doing, pay up." is what they would say. How about credit card debt you took out because your kids needed some new clothes or food and now you are stuck with growing interest rates? "Too bad, so sad, pay up, or else prison." Ever take a trip to the hospital for emergency surgery? A price tag of 150 grand for 3 days use of their facilities. "Sorry about your accident, now pay us whatever we want." How about YOUR mortgage THEY gambled away and in turn, caused a recession? "Yah, my bad, but according to OUR calculations, YOU actually OWE US now pay up." 

#Now the tables are turned.

Why should I give a flying fuck whether or not they can cover all the shares they shorted? Whatever comes around, goes around. Fuck you pay up.

"B-b-but that money doesn't exist." Doesn't fucking matter, make it exist and pay up.

"B-b-but stocks can't go that high." You shouldn't shorted it that much then, pay up. 

"B-b-but this will destroy the economy." I don't wanna hear your sob story, pay up.

"B-b-but infinity pool will make all money worthless." Too bad, so sad, pay the fuck up. You knew what you were doing. You did it anyways. Live with your consequences is what you would tell us. 

We will give you the same amount of mercy as you gave us. Find the money and buy back every single fucking share you shorted. 

#It's only fair we hold you to the same standard you held us.
