    "selftext": "Wondering if some smarter folks than myself can help provide some context. I haven\u2019t seen this discussed and I think it aligns well to some of the 7/14 theories we\u2019ve been seeing. \n\nAs far as I understand from what Wes, Dave, Dr. T etc. have said - a married put scheme to reduce SI% and kick the can down the road ends with both sides tearing up the contracts a few days before expiration. Today, and until they\u2019re torn up, these contracts are essentially \u201cpromised\u201d shares to cover shorts. \n\nOnce they\u2019re torn up, does another round of contracts need to be purchased immediately? Do the uncovered shorts enter another T+ cycle? Can they pre buy contracts today and assign them to these shorts now? Or, with the new rules (I forget them all), is the can kicking ability halted? \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to get to is this: I\u2019ve been disappointed by every date so far, but I\u2019m happy to get hype for 7/14 given the large number of coincidences we\u2019re uncovering. If RC understands the married put scheme then he\u2019d understand these contracts are torn up a few days before 7/16 expiration. If new rules, etc. prevent can kicking that means SHF\u2019s are going to have to cover ~30M shares at some point. If you\u2019re launching your company transforming blockchain the same time 30M shares need to cover that\u2019d be a hell of a potential catalyst. \n\nAny thoughts/opinions/wrinkles are appreciated. RC would have had foresight after the Jan sneeze to see the SHF\u2019s move and this could have always been his counter. The fact it\u2019s Bastille Day could just be somewhat coincidental to the overall scheme, but now certainly important in terms of dropping hints.",
