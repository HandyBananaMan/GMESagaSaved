Back from taking my board exams to lay some slick BCBApe shit on ya cause I passed....

That being said none of this shit has to do with that....but let's analyze some of this fucking shit I found thanks to [u/fewdea](https://www.reddit.com/u/fewdea/) and [u/snoo\_75309](https://www.reddit.com/u/snoo_75309/)

# Uno (Mas Escondite)

I ran across [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oovqze/whats_the_deal_with_selling_a_leased_car/h61vomz/?context=3)post earlier by [u/fewdea](https://www.reddit.com/u/fewdea/) where they mentioned that they went to sell their car to a used car company (guess they serve pancakes too?). When they went there a sign was up stating that the company was only able to buy cars back from folks who did not use specific lenders.

Financiers aren't letting people buy assets upon which loans are based because they then would have to turn that cash (which is a liability) over.

Remember [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) and [u/attobit](https://www.reddit.com/u/attobit/) talking about Citadel losing their clothes and cash being a fucking liability?

Hang in there with me.

[u/Snoo\_75309](https://www.reddit.com/u/Snoo_75309/) went on to question in a comment:

>‚ÄúI am a little confused though, i know cash is a liability for banks when it's their customers deposits, but cash from a sale of an asset the bank owns? I guess they're using deposits to invest in car loans that makes sense, because once they deposit the cash if it was deposit $ it becomes a liability vs an auto backed securities can be used as collateral for cash if the banks need the cash.‚Äù

Cash is a liability regardless of where it came from. It‚Äôs almost like they have a place to keep their assets without worrying of inflation or having someone come after it‚Ä¶.you know‚Ä¶..

Feel similar?

Yall. We see Reverse Repos every day regarding The Treasury. They don‚Äôt want to hold on to the cash so they are utilizing Reverse Repos (it aint a proper noun, but shit at this point I‚Äôm making it one).

Am I saying this is the same as Reverse Repos.

Absolutely hell fucking no. I‚Äôm saying this is another place for them to hide wealth and another way they are fucking our economy like..hmmmmmm Mortgage Backed Securities.... Shittily so because a car owner under an Automobile Loan (gonna call this a proper noun too and just capitalize on it...heh heh.) can‚Äôt sell their car/the automobile loan to get any equity out of what they may have in the car.

Remember this is a place they‚Äôre hiding assets, just as I found numerous major fucking banks jumped in together to buy a fucking AIRPLANE WAREHOUSE that cost 2 BILLION FUCKING DOLLARS.

I was going to post a link to the article. But some assholes are gonna shout conspiracy so let me just quote the hell of it all so you‚Äôre not dissuaded from linking.

[This was from Business Wire on April 27th:](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005957/en/Griffin-Global-Asset-Management-Closes-1-Billion-Warehouse-Facility)

Frackin hell, please go back and read my other juice if you‚Äôre having a hard time following this. I‚Äôm almost certain this Griffin Global Asset Management is one of KGs spinoffs like KP Holdings.

Think I‚Äôm just fucking around?

That is contradictory as fuck.

[u/Fewdea](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fewdea/) dug a little and also found that there were [Rental Backed Securities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/11/08/wall-street-figured-out-how-to-securitize-your-rent-should-you-worry/) that even awful MSM shouted about back in 2013.

^(Just gonna throw some more information in here that I‚Äôm really not sure what the fuck to make of:)

^(Guess who was buying up rental properties and using them as Rental Backed Securities? Blackstone. Guess who is still buying up rental properties like a dog licking their owners plate? Blackstone.)

^(Blackstone even went so far as to acquire) [^(Home Partners of America.)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/blackstone-to-acquire-home-partners-of-america-for-%246b-2021-06-23)
