<h1>What does DCG do?</h1>
<p>Welp. fucking everything. They own <a href="https://genesistrading.com/">Genesis</a>, <a href="https://grayscale.com/">Grayscale</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://foundrydigital.com/">Foundry</a>, and <a href="https://www.luno.com/">Luno</a>. These subsidiaries of DCG are all listed on their website but also in Grayscales most recent 8-K filing.</p>

<p><strong>Lets briefly dig into those subsidiaries to see exactly what's going on-</strong></p>
<p><strong>Genesis-</strong> (Que the 100x leverage)</p>
<p>Is a fully digitalized <strong>prime broker</strong> that provides investors with a secure marketplace to <strong>trade, borrow, lend and custody digital currencies.</strong></p>
<p>- Trading: "Complete large orders rapidly and reliably. Our <strong>OTC digital asset trading</strong> firm is regulated as a securities broker-dealer with the SEC and FINRA."</p>

"</p>
<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Grayscale-</strong></p>
<p>"Is the world’s <strong>largest digital currency asset manager</strong>. It sponsors fourteen investment products, including the Grayscale B****** Trust and the Digital Large Cap Fund"... Basically crypto ETFs.</p>
<p>Here's the "products" they offer</p>
<ol>
<li>Grayscale Basic Attention Token Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale B****** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale B****** Cash trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Chai**** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Decentralized Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Et****** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Et****** Classic Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale File**** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Hor**** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Lit**** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Live**** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Stel*** lum****Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Ze*** Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale De-Fi Trust</li>
<li>Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund</li>
</ol>
<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>CoinDesk-</strong></p>
<p>"CoinDesk is the leading source of <strong>blockchain news, research, and data</strong>. It organizes Consensus, the digital asset industry’s premier annual event." Simple put, a news to push DCG/ Greyscales narratives. They literally work in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-to-move-into-same-building-as-owner-digital-currency-group">the same fucking building</a> as DCG.</p>
<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Foundry-</strong></p>
<p>Is a <strong>financing and advisory</strong> company focused on digital asset <strong>mining</strong> and <strong>staking</strong>. By tapping DCG’s institutional expertise, capital, and market intelligence, Foundry provides North American b****** miners and manufacturers with the resources needed to maintain and secure decentralized networks. They also run the "Foundry USA Pool" to guarantee <strong>stable payouts</strong> for miners."</p>
<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Luno-</strong></p>
<p>"A leading <strong>digital asset exchange and wallet</strong> operating in major and emerging markets, Luno makes it safe and easy to buy, store and learn about cryptocurrencies." This is basically where they get retail investors, Grayscale in mostly intuitional.</p>
<h1>Tying things together/ TL:DR</h1>
<p>DCG is essentially a prime broker, hedge fund, crypto news/ media outlet and crypto trust/ ETF exchange. While also providing crypto wallets, a retail transaction platform, and mining/ Staking infrastructure. They have/ are building a monopoly over the crypto markets. They work with institutions, hedge funds, and market makers to lend and borrow crypto as a source of "alternative liquidity for hedging" on OTC markets. They have major connections to the US government, NASDAQ, World banks, any many hedge funds that we already know are short on capital due to "meme stocks". These fuckers basically have their hand in every sector of the crypto market and are centralizing it by using crypto as a source of liquidity and hedging for stock market based companies.</p>
<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
<p>look at the performance of Grayscales Trusts as more confirmation to this. They literally all 'pump and dump' between 12/2020 to now, or have an "inception date" between 2/26/2021- 7/14/2021 and follow the same 'pump and dump' trend... <a href="https://grayscale.com/products/">https://grayscale.com/products/</a></p>

<p><strong>Final note:</strong> I don't feel like this DD is fully complete. I believe there needs to be quite a bit more digging into DCG, its subsidiaries, and their connections- but I’m putting this out to hopefully get more eyes on DCG and more people digging.  Also, this is not financial advice.</p>
<p>Automod... Please fuck off</p>
