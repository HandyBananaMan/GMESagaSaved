<p>Back from taking my board exams to lay some slick BCBApe shit on ya cause I passed....</p>
<p>That being said none of this shit has to do with that....but let's analyze some of this fucking shit I found thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/fewdea/">u/fewdea</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/snoo_75309/">u/snoo_75309</a></p>
<h1>Uno (Mas Escondite)</h1>
<p>I ran across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oovqze/whats_the_deal_with_selling_a_leased_car/h61vomz/?context=3">this </a>post earlier by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/fewdea/">u/fewdea</a> where they mentioned that they went to sell their car to a used car company (guess they serve pancakes too?). When they went there a sign was up stating that the company was only able to buy cars back from folks who did not use specific lenders.</p>
<p>Financiers aren't letting people buy assets upon which loans are based because they then would have to turn that cash (which is a liability) over.</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/">u/criand</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/attobit/">u/attobit</a> talking about Citadel losing their clothes and cash being a fucking liability?</p>
<p>Hang in there with me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Snoo_75309/">u/Snoo_75309</a> went on to question in a comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI am a little confused though, i know cash is a liability for banks when it's their customers deposits, but cash from a sale of an asset the bank owns? I guess they're using deposits to invest in car loans that makes sense, because once they deposit the cash if it was deposit $ it becomes a liability vs an auto backed securities can be used as collateral for cash if the banks need the cash.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cash is a liability regardless of where it came from. It‚Äôs almost like they have a place to keep their assets without worrying of inflation or having someone come after it‚Ä¶.you know‚Ä¶..</p>
<p>Feel similar?</p>
<p>Yall. We see Reverse Repos every day regarding The Treasury. They don‚Äôt want to hold on to the cash so they are utilizing Reverse Repos (it aint a proper noun, but shit at this point I‚Äôm making it one).</p>
<p>Am I saying this is the same as Reverse Repos.</p>
<p>Absolutely hell fucking no. I‚Äôm saying this is another place for them to hide wealth and another way they are fucking our economy like..hmmmmmm Mortgage Backed Securities.... Shittily so because a car owner under an Automobile Loan (gonna call this a proper noun too and just capitalize on it...heh heh.) can‚Äôt sell their car/the automobile loan to get any equity out of what they may have in the car.</p>
