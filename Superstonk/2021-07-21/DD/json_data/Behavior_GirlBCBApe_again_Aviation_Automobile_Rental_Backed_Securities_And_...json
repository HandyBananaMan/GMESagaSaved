When they went there a sign was up stating that the company was only able to buy cars back from folks who did not use specific lenders.\n\nFinanciers aren't letting people buy assets upon which loans are based because they then would have to turn that cash (which is a liability) over.\n\nRemember [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) and [u/attobit](https://www.reddit.com/u/attobit/) talking about Citadel losing their clothes and cash being a fucking liability?\n\nHang in there with me.\n\n[u/Snoo\\_75309](https://www.reddit.com/u/Snoo_75309/) went on to question in a comment:\n\n>\u201cI am a little confused though, i know cash is a liability for banks when it's their customers deposits, but cash from a sale of an asset the bank owns? I guess they're using deposits to invest in car loans that makes sense, because once they deposit the cash if it was deposit $ it becomes a liability vs an auto backed securities can be used as collateral for cash if the banks need the cash.\u201d\n\nCash is a liability regardless of where it came from. It\u2019s almost like they have a place to keep their assets without worrying of inflation or having someone come after it\u2026.you know\u2026..\n\nFeel similar?\n\nYall. We see Reverse Repos every day regarding The Treasury. They don\u2019t want to hold on to the cash so they are utilizing Reverse Repos (it aint a proper noun, but shit at this point I\u2019m making it one).\n\nAm I saying this is the same as Reverse Repos.\n\nAbsolutely hell fucking no. I\u2019m saying this is another place for them to hide wealth and another way they are fucking our economy like..hmmmmmm Mortgage Backed Securities.... Shittily so because a car owner under an Automobile Loan (gonna call this a proper noun too and just capitalize on it...heh heh.) can\u2019t sell their car/the automobile loan to get any equity out of what they may have in the car.\n\n# Dos: El Coche\n\nLet thine eyes not deceive you.\n\n[Insights - Auto Asset-Backed Securities (diamond-hill.com)](https://www.diamond-hill.com/insights/a-152/auto-asset-backed-securities.fs)\n\nLookie lookie.

But some assholes are gonna shout conspiracy so let me just quote the hell of it all so you\u2019re not dissuaded from linking.\n\n[This was from Business Wire on April 27th:](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005957/en/Griffin-Global-Asset-Management-Closes-1-Billion-Warehouse-Facility)\n\n>\u201cDUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Griffin Global Asset Management DAC and Griffin Global Asset Management (Servicer) LLC (together, \u201cGriffin\u201d) announced today that on April 23, 2021 Palisade Aviation Holdings Warehouse, Ltd. and Palisade Aviation Holdings Warehouse, LLC (together, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d), closed a five-year senior secured warehouse facility with an initial committed amount of $1,000,000,0000 (the \u201cFacility\u201d).

This warehouse facility has significant capacity and flexibility that will allow us to create customized capital solutions for our airline customers going forward,\u201d said Ryan McKenna, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Griffin.  \n>  \n>\u201cDeveloping this warehouse facility was a collaborative process with our lending partners and resulted in a first-of-its-kind facility in the aviation industry. The overwhelming support from these seven financial institutions is very meaningful as the growth of Griffin accelerates. Going forward, we will continue to create innovative financial products that will meet the evolving needs of the airlines and OEMs in this dynamic market,\u201d said John Beekman, Chief Financial Officer of Griffin.  \n>  \n>Goldman Sachs acted as the structuring agent for the Facility. Initial commitments for the facility were provided by Goldman Sachs, Barclays Bank PLC, Mizuho Americas, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch.  \n>  \n>Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP acted as U.S. legal advisors to Griffin and the Borrowers, Milbank LLP acted as legal advisors to the Lenders, Maples and Calder (Ireland) LLP acted as Irish legal advisors for the Borrowers, Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP acted as Cayman Islands legal advisors for the Borrowers, A&L Goodbody LLP acted as Irish legal advisors to Griffin and PWC acted as Irish tax advisors for Griffin and the Borrowers. UMB Bank, N.A. is acting as the administrative agent and the security trustee.  \n>  \n>About Griffin Global Asset Management  \n>  \n>Griffin is a commercial aircraft leasing and alternative asset management business with offices in Dublin, Ireland and Los Angeles, USA.
