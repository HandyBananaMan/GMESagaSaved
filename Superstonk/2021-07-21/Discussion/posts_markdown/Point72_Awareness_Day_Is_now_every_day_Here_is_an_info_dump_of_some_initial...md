Chimps, Bonobos, Silverbacks - Lend me your ears. People keep calling out Point72 but I have yet to see any comprehensive looks into them with one incredible exception: [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8l53q/point72_aka_sac/) by  [u/No-Awareness-9362](https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Awareness-9362/). Please spare his work some of your time and throw him a tendie for his contribution. Well, [u/No-Awareness-9362](https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Awareness-9362/), I agree with you completely that the corruption is overwhelming and we DEFINITELY need more eyes on this. So without further chinwagging and screeching, here is my data dump contribution to fighting the good fight. I'm down to discuss anything here so fire away!

\-The fact that both Point72 Capital Advisors LLP AND Point72 Capital Advisors LLC. exist. WTF? sus right off the bat - any silverbacks have insight into why someone would need to incorporate twice but slightly differently?

[tons of businesses incorporate in Delaware, including subsidiaries of point72](https://bridgehouse.law/incorporate-in-delaware)

\-not saying incorporating in a state with corporation-friendly laws is inherently sus, but I always found it amusing that [one address is home to over 200,000 shell companies!](https://freebeacon.com/issues/delaware-address-home-200000-shell-companies-including-hillary-clintons/)

\-[Point72 showing 8-to-1 leverage in 2018](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/cohen-point72-s-reveals-high-leverage-as-firm-recruits-new-money)

\-Point72 was renamed to Point72 very recently, it was formerly known as SAC Capital Advisors LP (yes, I believe that is different from the LLC and LLP above, so it's actually 3 identically named entities. don't tell me it's not sketch as hell!)

[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/ia-4287.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2015/ia-4287.pdf) <- I'm posting this less in reference to the actual filing contents, and more what it reveals about the extent of Point72/Cohen's tendrils by confirming the existence of his companies:

\-S.A.C. Capital Advisors, L.P.

\-S.A.C. Capital Advisors, LLC

\-72 Credit Management LLC

\-S.A.C. Private Equity GP, L.P.

\-Point72 Asia (Hong Kong) Limited

\-Point72 Asia (North Asia) Limited

\-Point72 Asia (Singapore) Limited

\-S.A.C. Global Investors, LLP

\-CR Intrinsic Investors, LLC

\-[Sigma Capital Management](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/sigma+capital+management/207/), a subsidiary of S.A.C. Capital Advisors

we need more wrinkle brains and data combers looking straight at Point72, PRONTO. Citadel is a business worth about 26 Billion, Steve Cohen personally controls over 11 billion and -as you can see from above- has an *international* presence in financial markets.

\-[https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/claims/cr-intrinsic-investors.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/claims/cr-intrinsic-investors.htm) CR Intrinsic Investors LLC - the guy who got 9 years (Martoma Sentencing link above) was also a portfolio manager at CRII, and here they are in an insider trading suit

[https://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/SAC\_Capital\_Advisors\_LP](https://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/SAC_Capital_Advisors_LP) <- on marketswiki, CR Intrinsic Investors is listed under "products and services" for SAC Capital Advisors LP

I know everyone associates Cohen with the BIG suit that barred him from trading, but dear lord the extent by which his affiliates and subsidiaries have continued to do these things is ASTOUNDING. Let me know what y'all think, I think Stevey boy here has a *lot* of capital and a lot of presence to get up to his seemingly usual tomfoolery.

Don't forget, he [assisted in the Smellvin bailout](https://clutchpoints.com/mets-owner-steve-cohen-bails-out-melvin-capital-amid-gamestop-reddit-stock-fiasco/), albeit to a lesser degree than shitadel. Ok will check back soon - obligatory *end the fed*

OOOOK OOOK OOOOOK got some navy blue crayon soup for dinner tonight!!!
