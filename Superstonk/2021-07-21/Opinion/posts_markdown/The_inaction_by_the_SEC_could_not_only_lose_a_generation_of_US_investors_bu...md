I saw the post here by u/jscottmsn1, in which he is saying the longer this drags out, the lower the trust in the "free" market idea...and the less people will want to invest in equities after all this:

I have thought about this a lot too, but with a slightly different context. This is something that is already happening now, I believe, with us non-US investor Apes. Many of the American Apes who have 401ks might not have a lot of choice and be 'forced' to invest and re-invest in US stocks. But the rest of us, many who would have invested heavily into NYSE and NASDAQ listed stocks in the past, are probably already pulling our money out in droves (except GME!)

As for me, although I am a British Ape based in Asia, up to now I have mostly invested in US stocks and a local US ETFs based retirement/pension fund over here. My entire stock holdings are *still* US-only, but that is only because I've YOLO'd all my available cash I have into this game. But I cannot cash out the retirement/pension fund, only change the ETFs selected within it due to a lock period. After learning over these last 7 months what a shitshow the US markets truly are, I changed all the ETFs in this to non-US equities ages ago...

The reason is not because I expect better returns from UK, EU, Japanese, Hong Kong, Indian etc. stocks. In fact, the US market is *still* likely to give better returns over the long run. But it is a matter of principle now for me: I think US returns are higher not because the markets are more free, but because they are more *rigged*. Other markets have their share of problems too, but with nothing like the level of corruption and collusion that we are seeing right now in the US, and which the SEC is seemingly turning a blind eye to.

The longer this drags on, the more likely I am never going to invest a cent into US equities again after all this is done. I am sure I am not the only non-US Ape who has the same thoughts and already changed their investing approach. Believe it or not, non-Americans own more than 40% of American equities now. We might not have much power to ask for change from overseas, but we certainly do have the power of our wallets. 

So all I can say to the people at the SEC is that if you truly want to protect the American markets, then **do your damn jobs.**
