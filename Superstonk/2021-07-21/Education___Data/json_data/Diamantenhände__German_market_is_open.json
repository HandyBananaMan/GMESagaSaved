    "selftext": "Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes across the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nIt *seems* that days like yesterday would be easy to write about, but honestly, they are more challenging. I like to highlight the strength of our Diamantenh\u00e4nde. When Apes HODL on red days, why would that change on green days? When the endurance of our Diamantenh\u00e4nde gets tested by short attacks, why not sit here polishing them when the hedgies slow down the short machine? The excitement is growing again, fresh DD and even fresher memes are flowing again, and this community's endurance continues to astound me. The apes are here, ready for whatever comes our way, and we'll HODL together and through it all.\n\nToday is Wednesday, July 21th and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n- \u2b1c 120 minutes in: **$193.60 / 164,45 \u20ac**  *(volume: 972)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 115 minutes in: $193.60 / 164,45 \u20ac  *(volume: 958)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 110 minutes in: $192.01 / 163,10 \u20ac  *(volume: 656)*\n- \u2b1c 105 minutes in: $191.19 / 162,40 \u20ac  *(volume: 606)*\n- \u2b1c 100 minutes in: $191.19 / 162,40 \u20ac  *(volume: 556)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 95 minutes in: $191.19 / 162,40 \u20ac  *(volume: 555)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 90 minutes in: $191.20 / 162,41 \u20ac  *(volume: 549)*\n- \u2b1c 85 minutes in: $192.07 / 163,15 \u20ac  *(volume: 392)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 80 minutes in: $192.07 / 163,15 \u20ac  *(volume: 392)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 65 minutes in: $190.25 / 161,60 \u20ac  *(volume: 366)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 60 minutes in: $190.06 / 161,44 \u20ac  *(volume: 355)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 55 minutes in: $189.95 / 161,35 \u20ac  *(volume: 322)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 50 minutes in: $190.20 / 161,56 \u20ac  *(volume: 303)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 45 minutes in: $190.16 / 161,53 \u20ac  *(volume: 303)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 40 minutes in: $190.06 / 161,44 \u20ac  *(volume: 303)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 35 minutes in: $189.98 / 161,38 \u20ac  *(volume: 295)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 30 minutes in: $190.39 / 161,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 183)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 25 minutes in: $190.42 / 161,75 \u20ac  *(volume: 183)*\n- \u2b1c 20 minutes in: $190.50 / 161,81 \u20ac  *(volume: 179)*\n- \u2b1c 15 minutes in: $190.50 / 161,81 \u20ac  *(volume: 179)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 10 minutes in: $190.50 / 161,81 \u20ac  *(volume: 114)*\n- \ud83d\udfe5 5 minutes in: $191.07 / 162,30 \u20ac  *(volume: 22)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $191.20 / 162,41 \u20ac  *(volume: 15)*\n- \ud83d\udfe9 US close price: $191.18 / 162,39 \u20ac   *($190.80 / 162,07 \u20ac after-hours)*\n\n\n***\nFAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.17726697. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)\n\nMany among the Diamantenh\u00e4nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler, following their sudden disappearance after Memorial Day. I also am worried, as I had tried to make contact many times and never received a direct response. Three weeks ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the curator of the series. I've been serving as host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
