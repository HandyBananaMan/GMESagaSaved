    "selftext": "Hello apes!  \n\nThis is a small project I started for myself a while back.  I see there are some other projects in the works that are  much more sophisticated (unlike Chicago) which are just amazing so before I get to my small effort I just want to give some shout outs.  If you haven\u2019t already read these posts I recommend you take a look.\n\n[KNOTSREPUS: The DD has been secured. (Well, most of it.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on15to/knotsrepus_the_dd_has_been_secured_well_most_of_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) by u/VoxUmbra \n\n[DATES, DD & DATA all in one place: \ud83c\udf15MoonTimers v1.1 update with some new features for you!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ooszki/dates_dd_data_all_in_one_place_moontimers_v11/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) by u/Jaylee9000\n\nWith that said, what I have done is much more basic.  Currently I have archived over 180 posts that are all GME related and mostly DD.  This is by no means a full backup, but the most important information is now archived in both the **Wayback Machine** platform and **archive.today** platform.  All of this is included in the following spreadsheet. \n\n\ud83d\udea8GME Archive Spreadsheet\ud83d\udea8\n\nGoogle Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9GVL2j7eAHtvCU3SyQvA6ZbLrYE3MFsNidM9UCn9v4/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- This has been a pretty manual process so if you notice any errors such as dead links or typos please let me know and I will correct them\n\n- I have archived several DD backup posts and have archived links to the PDF documents where relevant\n\n- I may continue to add to this project in which case I will provide an updated list.  If I continue the project I am open to suggestions of posts to include into the archive list or if any posts have been debunked I am open to removing them to avoid misinformation \n\n- One consideration I have for this project is to begin transposing more DD into PDF format as was done by u/atobitt with [HOC I, II, & III](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm83eb/a_house_of_cards_parts_i_ii_iii_in_pdf/) as well as by u/feltdumbmightdelete with [The Bigger Short by Criand](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1fq9r/second_try_hi_i_made_a_pdf_of_criands_dd_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) but I have not yet found the time to dedicate to this task so no promises\n\n- I have also cross-posted each of these posts with the backup links to a new sub dedicated to archiving GME posts but not sure if I can share the sub here.  If you\u2019re interested you can find the archive sub on my post and comment history but it just mirrors what is on the spreadsheet\n\nI will be looking for an easier method of keeping the list updated and shareable so if I find a better solution I will come back and update.  If I continue to add to the list I will re-post with the updates.  I just wanted to share in case anyone finds it useful.  \n\nThat\u2019s all.  I hope it helps and I will see you all on the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
