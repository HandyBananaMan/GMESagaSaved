<p>Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes across the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>It <em>seems</em> that days like yesterday would be easy to write about, but honestly, they are more challenging. I like to highlight the strength of our Diamantenhände. When Apes HODL on red days, why would that change on green days? When the endurance of our Diamantenhände gets tested by short attacks, why not sit here polishing them when the hedgies slow down the short machine? The excitement is growing again, fresh DD and even fresher memes are flowing again, and this community's endurance continues to astound me. The apes are here, ready for whatever comes our way, and we'll HODL together and through it all.</p>
<p>Today is Wednesday, July 21th and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>

<p>FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.17726697. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check <a href="https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie">Lang &amp; Schwarz</a> or <a href="https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099">TradeGate</a></p>
<p>Many among the Diamantenhände community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler, following their sudden disappearance after Memorial Day. I also am worried, as I had tried to make contact many times and never received a direct response. Three weeks ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the curator of the series. I've been serving as host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!</p>
