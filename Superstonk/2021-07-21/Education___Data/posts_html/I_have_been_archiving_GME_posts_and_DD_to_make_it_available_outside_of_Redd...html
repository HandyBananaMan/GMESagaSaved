<p>Hello apes!  </p>
<p>This is a small project I started for myself a while back.  I see there are some other projects in the works that are  much more sophisticated (unlike Chicago) which are just amazing so before I get to my small effort I just want to give some shout outs.  If you havenâ€™t already read these posts I recommend you take a look.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on15to/knotsrepus_the_dd_has_been_secured_well_most_of_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">KNOTSREPUS: The DD has been secured. (Well, most of it.)</a> by u/VoxUmbra </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ooszki/dates_dd_data_all_in_one_place_moontimers_v11/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">DATES, DD &amp; DATA all in one place: ðŸŒ•MoonTimers v1.1 update with some new features for you!</a> by u/Jaylee9000</p>
<p>With that said, what I have done is much more basic.  Currently I have archived over 180 posts that are all GME related and mostly DD.  This is by no means a full backup, but the most important information is now archived in both the <strong>Wayback Machine</strong> platform and <strong>archive.today</strong> platform.  All of this is included in the following spreadsheet. </p>
<p>ðŸš¨GME Archive SpreadsheetðŸš¨</p>
<p>Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-9GVL2j7eAHtvCU3SyQvA6ZbLrYE3MFsNidM9UCn9v4/edit?usp=sharing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This has been a pretty manual process so if you notice any errors such as dead links or typos please let me know and I will correct them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have archived several DD backup posts and have archived links to the PDF documents where relevant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I may continue to add to this project in which case I will provide an updated list.  If I continue the project I am open to suggestions of posts to include into the archive list or if any posts have been debunked I am open to removing them to avoid misinformation </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One consideration I have for this project is to begin transposing more DD into PDF format as was done by u/atobitt with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm83eb/a_house_of_cards_parts_i_ii_iii_in_pdf/">HOC I, II, &amp; III</a> as well as by u/feltdumbmightdelete with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1fq9r/second_try_hi_i_made_a_pdf_of_criands_dd_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">The Bigger Short by Criand</a> but I have not yet found the time to dedicate to this task so no promises</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have also cross-posted each of these posts with the backup links to a new sub dedicated to archiving GME posts but not sure if I can share the sub here.  If youâ€™re interested you can find the archive sub on my post and comment history but it just mirrors what is on the spreadsheet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be looking for an easier method of keeping the list updated and shareable so if I find a better solution I will come back and update.  If I continue to add to the list I will re-post with the updates.  I just wanted to share in case anyone finds it useful.  </p>
<p>Thatâ€™s all.  I hope it helps and I will see you all on the moon ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
