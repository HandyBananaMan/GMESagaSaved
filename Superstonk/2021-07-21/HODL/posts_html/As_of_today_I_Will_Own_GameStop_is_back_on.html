<p>Hello Apes.</p>
<p>It has been nearly six months since my original thesis (which I cannot link here due to where it was posted and the auto-mod settings; it was back in February, so you can probably work it out) on how GameStop is worth more than the current price ($40 at the time), how GameStop is poised to do amazing things like create their own livestream content, produce their own high-production-quality original content, get into esports, etc... and most importantly: how hedge funds, market ma(ke)nipulators, and short sellers artificially suppressing the price creates an opportunity to exponentially increase one's position, forever.</p>
<h2>Well, I'm back. And I'm a little pissed off.</h2>
<hr />
<p>After continually seeing nothing but positive news about GME, bullshit ways in which MSM spins the situation, short sell ratios through the roof, buy to sell ratios <em>grossly</em> weighted on the buy side (clearly routed through dark pools), etc... I've decided to step back up to the plate and continue doing my job: which is working toward owning this company outright.</p>
<p>This will be accomplished the same way I managed to increase my position throughout the time I was actively pursuing my thesis: leveraging options (by way of my share count), in order to amass capital on a weekly/monthly basis, and use that premium to acquire more shares.</p>
<p>Additionally, excess money that my business generates will be allocated to my portfolio in order to take advantage of sudden discounts; after all, averaging down is a gift.</p>
<p>I am currently an XXXX shareholder. This week I acquired XXX more shares, and I expect I'll acquire XX more shares by end of next week.</p>
<p>This will continue every week until The Big Event.</p>
<hr />
<p>Either I win, or you win; and as long as the stock price remains suppressed, my share count will increase at a compound rate.</p>
<p>See y'all from the boardroom.</p>
<hr />
<p>*edit to add (included this in a separate post, but it makes more sense to tack it on here):</p>
<p><strong>I do not recommend anyone follow me on this path.</strong> My understanding is that most of you are here for the MOAÃŸ, and playing options is a good way to miss it. </p>
<p>Over-leveraging yourself on long calls is a good way to end with zero money in your account when hedgies toy with the price.</p>
<p>Selling the wrong dates and strikes on covered calls is a good way to lose your shares when the rocket launches. </p>
<p>If you mess with puts on GME, I don't even know what to say to you (good luck, I guess).</p>
<p>Know that if this drags out long enough, you lot (apes with a fixed floor, who want to make the world a better place) are going to be a much smaller problem for hedge funds to deal with than I am going to be.</p>
<p>I don't need or particularly want the money. I just want to own this company; I found a mathematical anomaly through which I believe it is possible, and I intend to explore it to it's fullest extent (but I imagine the main event will occur long before I acquire enough shares to cause any sort of gridlock).</p>
