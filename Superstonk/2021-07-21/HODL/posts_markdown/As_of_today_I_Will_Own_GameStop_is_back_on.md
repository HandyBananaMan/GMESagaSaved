Hello Apes.

It has been nearly six months since my original thesis (which I cannot link here due to where it was posted and the auto-mod settings; it was back in February, so you can probably work it out) on how GameStop is worth more than the current price ($40 at the time), how GameStop is poised to do amazing things like create their own livestream content, produce their own high-production-quality original content, get into esports, etc... and most importantly: how hedge funds, market ma(ke)nipulators, and short sellers artificially suppressing the price creates an opportunity to exponentially increase one's position, forever.


##Well, I'm back. And I'm a little pissed off.

After continually seeing nothing but positive news about GME, bullshit ways in which MSM spins the situation, short sell ratios through the roof, buy to sell ratios *grossly* weighted on the buy side (clearly routed through dark pools), etc... I've decided to step back up to the plate and continue doing my job: which is working toward owning this company outright.


This will be accomplished the same way I managed to increase my position throughout the time I was actively pursuing my thesis: leveraging options (by way of my share count), in order to amass capital on a weekly/monthly basis, and use that premium to acquire more shares.


Additionally, excess money that my business generates will be allocated to my portfolio in order to take advantage of sudden discounts; after all, averaging down is a gift.


I am currently an XXXX shareholder. This week I acquired XXX more shares, and I expect I'll acquire XX more shares by end of next week.


This will continue every week until The Big Event.

Either I win, or you win; and as long as the stock price remains suppressed, my share count will increase at a compound rate.


See y'all from the boardroom.

*edit to add (included this in a separate post, but it makes more sense to tack it on here):

**I do not recommend anyone follow me on this path.** My understanding is that most of you are here for the MOAÃŸ, and playing options is a good way to miss it. 

Over-leveraging yourself on long calls is a good way to end with zero money in your account when hedgies toy with the price.

Selling the wrong dates and strikes on covered calls is a good way to lose your shares when the rocket launches. 

If you mess with puts on GME, I don't even know what to say to you (good luck, I guess).

Know that if this drags out long enough, you lot (apes with a fixed floor, who want to make the world a better place) are going to be a much smaller problem for hedge funds to deal with than I am going to be.

I don't need or particularly want the money. I just want to own this company; I found a mathematical anomaly through which I believe it is possible, and I intend to explore it to it's fullest extent (but I imagine the main event will occur long before I acquire enough shares to cause any sort of gridlock).
