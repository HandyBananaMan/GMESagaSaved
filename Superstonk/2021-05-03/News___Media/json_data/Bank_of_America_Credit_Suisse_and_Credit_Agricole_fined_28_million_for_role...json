The manipulative activity affected secondary market trading in US dollar SSA bonds for the entire European Economic Area, the Commission said.   \n>  \n>Deutsche Bank had also taken part in the cartel but was not fined alongside the other investment banks as it revealed the existence of the cartel.  \n>  \n>\u201cToday we have issued a decision against Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, whose traders colluded on trading strategies, exchanged sensitive pricing information and coordinated on prices,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the Commission in charge of competition policy.  \n>  \n>\u201cThe behaviour of the investment banks restricted competition in a market in which investment and pension funds regularly buy and sell bonds on behalf of their investors and pensioners. The cartel harmed the financial markets and today\u2019s decision sends a clear message that the Commission will not tolerate any type of collusive behaviour.\u201d  \n>  \n>Of the \u20ac28 million penalty, Bank of America Merrill Lynch received the most severe fine of \u20ac12, 642,000, followed by Credit Suisse who received a fine of \u20ac11,859,000, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole who received a fine of \u20ac3,993,000.  \n>  \n>The fine marks the latest crackdown on cartel activity within large investment banks by the Commission. In 2019, Barclays, RBS, Citi, JP Morgan and MUFG paid a [combined \u20ac1.07 billion in penalties](https://www.thetradenews.com/major-banks-fined-e1-billion-role-fx-trading-cartel/) for their involvement in a cartel that rigged FX spot prices for 11 currencies.",
