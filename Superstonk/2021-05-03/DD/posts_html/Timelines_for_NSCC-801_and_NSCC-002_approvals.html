<p>Usual disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m talking about, all of this is probably wrong, fact check and do your own research.</p>
<p>I wanted to jot down all the lasted info and resources on SR-NSCC-2021-801 and SR-NSCC-2021-002, and when they may get approved. I will refer to the changes as NSCC-801 and NSCC-002 for short.</p>
<p>March 5, 2021: <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf">DTCC Important Notice</a> describes two changes:</p>

<p>I'm running with calendar days where unspecified (just "days"). If you know better let me know.</p>
<p>There are provisions for expediting emergency changes, but NSCC didn’t classify this as an emergency change.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there's a wide span when this rule change may happen. It may happen today, but it equally may not happen before September/October. So, don't get excited about nearby dates, but know that this change is lurking like a shark and may happen at any moment. I sure hope it happens soon!</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have a different reading - I'll happily add edits.</p>
<p>Edits: defaulting to calendar days instead of business days. basing 002 approval on publication date instead of the filing date. Updated NSCC-002 dates based on info from u/Basting_Rootwalla. The changes were dated 3/18, but actually published to the federal register on 3/24. Shifted dates.</p>
<p>Edit 2: updated reflecting delay action on 5/7</p>
