Usual disclaimer: I don’t know what I’m talking about, all of this is probably wrong, fact check and do your own research.

I wanted to jot down all the lasted info and resources on SR-NSCC-2021-801 and SR-NSCC-2021-002, and when they may get approved. I will refer to the changes as NSCC-801 and NSCC-002 for short.

March 5, 2021: [DTCC Important Notice](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf) describes two changes:

1. An Advanced Notice ([NSCC-801](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf)).
2. A Proposed Rule Change ([NSCC-002](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-002.pdf))

NOTE: both of these need to be greenlighted for the proposed change to go through.

Here's where to see the status of the changes:

* Official [DTCC rule change updates](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.aspx?subsidiary=NSCC&pgs=1)
* Official SEC updates for [NSCC-002](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm#SR-NSCC-2021-002) and [NSCC-801](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an.htm#SR-NSCC-2021-801).

&#x200B;

These changes are governed by these rules, which lay out the deadlines:

* For NSCC-801: [Section 806(e)(1)](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67286.pdf)
* For NSCC-002: [Section 19(b)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78s)

I'm running with calendar days where unspecified (just "days"). If you know better let me know.

There are provisions for expediting emergency changes, but NSCC didn’t classify this as an emergency change.

In conclusion, there's a wide span when this rule change may happen. It may happen today, but it equally may not happen before September/October. So, don't get excited about nearby dates, but know that this change is lurking like a shark and may happen at any moment. I sure hope it happens soon!

Please let me know if you have a different reading - I'll happily add edits.

Edits: defaulting to calendar days instead of business days. basing 002 approval on publication date instead of the filing date. Updated NSCC-002 dates based on info from u/Basting_Rootwalla. The changes were dated 3/18, but actually published to the federal register on 3/24. Shifted dates.

Edit 2: updated reflecting delay action on 5/7
