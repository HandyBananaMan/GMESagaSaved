    "selftext": "I would like to start this off by saying this is not financial advise and I am by no means a financial expert. To be completely transparent I started my trading \"career\" with options on RobintheHood at the start of quarantine because I was layed off. I started with a few hundred dollars and on my best days I made 2-3 thousand. I started withdrawing money to blow it on clothes and dumb shit. Then proceeded to get way too confident trading and lost the rest. (smooth brained I know). I did not start buying and holding shares until this year. Writing this took all 3 of my brain cells working extra hard. Take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\n# HOW HEDGE FUNDS ARE RAISING FUNDS THRU OPTION CONTRACTS\n\nI have to start this off with a backstory nobody wants to hear unfortunately. I was at the dentist for my 6 month checkup and I struck up a conversation with my dentist about stocks. We started off with the usual stock chatter (Tesla, blue chip stocks, blah blah) but then I began to explain why I like the stock so much. I present all the DD and facts I have been educating myself on the past few months (FTD, synthetic shares, etc). Unfortunately, he does not believe in GME and told me about how he tried to sell $800 calls on GME. His broker (fuck I wish I asked what broker he was, on any apes have information on this?) did not allow him to sell a call unhedged (without 100 GME shares) even though he had the necessary funds in his account to buy 100 shares of GME at the time. and that got me thinking...\n\nThe closing price on April 30th was 173.59. Multiply that by 100 and that is $17,359\n\nIf you are bearish on GME, why the **fuck** would you own $17,359 worth of shares in GME only to collect an option premium?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Webull options chain for the strike he was trying to sell](https://preview.redd.it/ij9kyhejfuw61.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c5174ff67971234b87d805faa2efaeb9128b4d8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe majority of these options are likely not being sold by your friendly neighborhood retail investor. **They are being sold by the hedge funds shorting the stock.** Hedgies have market maker exceptions and are legally allowed to sell uncovered options.\n\n# VOLUME IN OPTIONS CHAIN:\n\nTo further prove my theory, I decided to check out the options chain to see the volume of options on various strike prices for May 7th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ITM options via Yahoo finacne](https://preview.redd.it/70s5vi3vhuw61.png?width=1778&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c454f17fa7079ac7e4bcb880dd63daafe3818cf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ITM options cont.](https://preview.redd.it/ghd3vfwlhuw61.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7e96d8948feae196dc496020538c51646420999)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OTM options](https://preview.redd.it/5luv5a3yhuw61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8a291ed1eaebb6e3056c5df4dd0f010292a9fa8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OTM options](https://preview.redd.it/qortrx81iuw61.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=db62bf67872ac19569c2c438ed7d444a4ab99b4d)\n\nNotice the insane amount of options currently OTM? Especially at $430 and $300. If GME has another side ways week you literally handed free money to Kenny himself to help him fund his side of the war. An important part to this theory is **option sellers collect the premium right away when they sell an option contract.** For example these options could have been sold a week or ago when the premium was likely much higher.\n\n# CONCLUSION OF THE DD AND MY THESIS:\n\nThe short selling hedge funds are selling options to further delay the MOASS and stay afloat longer. They collect premiums by selling options contracts. The evidence of the insane amount of synthetic shares is out there and plenty of DD exists proving the theory (I am sure you have read it by now). As long as apes hold and GME does not go bankrupt, the shares **WILL** have to be bought back. Short sellers **WILL** have to buy back shares that are sold when they are margin called. **There is no need to purchase options at unreasonable and speculative strike prices. Nobody knows then MOASS is going to happen quit gambling and guessing.**\n\n# STAY AWAY FROM OPTIONS BUY AND HOLD SHARES. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE I JUST LIKE THE STOCK. GME IS NOT GOING BANKRUPT, THE INSANE AMOUNT OF SYNTHETIC SHARES WILL HAVE TO BE COVERED.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully I am parking my dodge demon at my dentist office in 6 months.  :)\n\nTL;DR: Read the title\n\nIf any DD or facts disprove the information in my post PLEASE comment so I can edit. Also if any better DD posts exist that confirm or help please comment as well.\n\nEDIT 1: u/AvenDonn commented that hedgies have market maker exceptions and can sell uncovered options legally. Failed to mention that in my original post so I added it in.\n\n&#x200B;",
