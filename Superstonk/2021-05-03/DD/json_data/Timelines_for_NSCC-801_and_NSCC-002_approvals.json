I will refer to the changes as NSCC-801 and NSCC-002 for short.\n\nMarch 5, 2021: [DTCC Important Notice](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/5/a8974.pdf) describes two changes:\n\n1.

If approved during the above period, Implementation within 10 business days after both the NSCC-801 notice period, and NSCC-002 is SEC approved.                                      From [NSCC-801](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf): \u201cNSCC would implement the proposed changes no later than 10 Business Days after the later of the no objection to the advance notice \\[NSCC-801\\] and approval of the related proposed rule change \\[NSCC-002\\] by the Commission. NSCC would announce the effective date of the proposed changes by Important Notice posted to its website. \u201c We'll know when this happens by checking [DTCC important Notices](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?subsidiary=NSCC&pgs=1)|\n|2021\\_09\\_20 or earlier|NSCC\\_002|**Pessimistic scenario** (going through SEC proceeding): SEC to approve or deny (within 180 days of publication). Timing from [Section 19(b)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78s):  \"not later than 180 days after the date of publication \\[the SEC\\] shall issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change.\"|\n|2021\\_10\\_04 or earlier|NSCC\\_801, NSCC\\_002|**Pessimistic scenario** (going through SEC proceeding) Implementation within 10 business days ... (details above).|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm running with calendar days where unspecified (just \"days\"). If you know better let me know.\n\nThere are provisions for expediting emergency changes, but NSCC didn\u2019t classify this as an emergency change.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a wide span when this rule change may happen. It may happen today, but it equally may not happen before September/October. So, don't get excited about nearby dates, but know that this change is lurking like a shark and may happen at any moment. I sure hope it happens soon!\n\nPlease let me know if you have a different reading - I'll happily add edits.\n\nEdits: defaulting to calendar days instead of business days. basing 002 approval on publication date instead of the filing date. Updated NSCC-002 dates based on info from u/Basting_Rootwalla. The changes were dated 3/18, but actually published to the federal register on 3/24. Shifted dates.\n\nEdit 2: updated reflecting delay action on 5/7",
