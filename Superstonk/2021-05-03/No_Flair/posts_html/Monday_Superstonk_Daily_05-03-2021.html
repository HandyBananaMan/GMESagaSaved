<h1>Top Story: The US House Committee on Financial Services Hearing Date set for Thursday May 6, 2021 at 12:00 Eastern</h1>
<h2>Title: Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide, Part III</h2>
<p><strong>The Financial Services committee announced they will be holding</strong> <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407748"><strong>Part 3 of their Gamestop hearings</strong></a> <strong>this Thursday.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ugsvu551erw61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dfb8917f9fcbac19fb13832b0cfe67e9a3c138e">That witness list 👀</a></p>
<p>Check out the witness panel. Not only are we hearing from the new SEC man himself, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/who-is-gary-gensler-5095448">Gary Gensler</a>, but we are going to hear from the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dtcc.asp">DTCC</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/finra.asp">FINRA</a> as well. That's it- that's all the key players sitting at one table. Talk about a high stakes poker game. Whose bluff will show first?</p>
<p>To be clear, I personally am not expecting ground breaking results from this hearing. I don't usually enjoy partaking in such political theater but I am obviously invested in this topic in multiple ways and I look forward to the relevant entities finally at least having to speak for themselves. I wait with bated breath to be proven wrong 🙃.</p>

<h1>📣AMA News- Our next AMA guest announced: Dave Lauer, Market Structure and High Frequency Trading Expert and former Citadel Employee</h1>
<p><strong>AMA to be live streamed on the Non-Monetized</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/fGVY2Kco8ng"><strong>Superstonk Live YouTube channel</strong></a> <strong>this Wednesday, May 5th, 2021 at 3pm Eastern</strong></p>
<p>Superstonk Live is on fire and we thought, why not strike while the iron is hot and get another wrinkly brain to come join us? But we didn't get just anyone. We got Dave Lauer.</p>
<p>As a former Citadel employee, Dave's expertise is in market microstructure. Dr T. understands everything that happens after the trade takes place, and he understands everything that happens on the other side - how orders are handled by retail and institutional brokers, how they are routed through the complex set of pipes and markets, how high-frequency trading firms trade on and off-exchange. He can talk about dark pools and internalization systems, and he can talk about market regulation and rules.</p>
<p>And this AMA will be hosted by our very own u/Jsmar18! Here's a little note from J:</p>
<p><em>Hey guys! Jsmar18 here, and I'm the lucky primate who'll be hosting the next</em> r/Superstonk <em>AMA with Dave Lauer, otherwise known as</em> u/dlauer*.*</p>
<p><em>Who am I? I'm a recent addition to the Mod team and write DD with a focus on HFT, market structure and a sprinkle of exchanges to help us apes peel the ever so complex onion that is the US stock market.</em></p>
<p><em>I look forward to reading through and compiling the many questions you have for Dave, given his wide reaching experience in the industry. This is going to be one awesome session that you cannot miss!</em></p>

<p><strong>We've had a lot of questions about how to vote, where to vote, and what investors are voting for. Here with an article on Proxy Voting is</strong> u/Bye_Triangle**:**</p>
<h1>Proxy Voting and you!</h1>
<p>DEMOCRACY!</p>
<p>Last week, as many of you know already, GameStop released their Proxy materials. If you are not yet 100% on what that exactly means that's okay, I got you. Essentially, these Proxy Materials lay out what we will be voting on and why, when it comes time. Now, some of you have already gotten the chance to vote, and that is awesome.</p>
<p>For those that haven't gotten the opportunity yet, your time will come. I personally am still waiting on my turn, do not worry if you are still waiting. If you aren't sure if you will be able to vote...</p>
<p><strong>CONTACT YOUR BROKER, THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO WILL BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU BASED ON YOUR EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!</strong></p>
<p>It is extremely important that you aren't just taking advice on this from the subreddit, every broker has slightly different ways of doing things, and in this subreddit there are people from all over the world, using brokers with all sorts of different rules under all sorts of different legal systems. So I reiterate:</p>
<p>CONTACT YOUR BROKER IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR VOTE!!!!</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, we thought it may be important to touch on the process of voting again, this vote is incredibly important and could determine the future of GameStop as a company... Squeeze or no, it should be regarded as a priority for you to take the time to make your voice heard. You have invested time and money into this company and it would be a waste to not vote if you can.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Voting:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER</li>
</ol>
<p>Obtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.</p>
<ol>
<li>INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.</p>
<ol>
<li>UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible. Many speculate that there may be some short-seller-related fuckery with the votes given how badly they are likely hurting right now. With the untold number of borrowed shares and phantom shares flying around it certainly seems possible we may see a substantial number of over-votes (votes that exceed the total number of existing shares). It is unclear exactly how this will be handled if it does come to fruition, so it is best you vote the moment you are able.</p>

<h1>Melvin Capital Management Amends 13F Form to Request Confidential Filings of Ownership</h1>

<h1>FUD, Shills and Bots, Oh My!!</h1>
<p>We've been talking about auto-mod and the heightened karma requirements to interact on the sub. I also have seen a lot of you commenting on how pleasant it is to peruse the sub now, and you have all gotten your spidey sense for shills fine tuned, I'm so proud of you! 🥰</p>
<p>Really, I want to speak to that for a minute. Because I realize, 6 months ago, I would have thought someone was nuts for speaking about/like this. But we are in the middle of some of the greatest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare">psychological warfare</a> in human history right here in this very sub. You know that, I know that. And this is just your reminder that <em>you're not crazy and this is not normal.</em></p>
<p>I have been screenshotting the senseless harassment and strange confrontations that go beyond just internet trolling since January. I've had hate posts about me way before becoming a mod, and I know many of you have too. Does that make sense to you? I'm literally an anonymous pink cat in an internet forum, up until recently just posting stupid memes and such... why are there petitions to have me put in <em>jail</em>?</p>
<p>Because this is <strong><em>big</em></strong>. Dr. T has said it herself. <strong>THEY ARE SPENDING</strong> <strong><em>A LOT</em></strong> <strong>OF MONEY TO KEEP US QUIET.</strong></p>
<p>Y'all know the vibe of the sub by now. The transparency, the camaraderie, the brilliant &amp; respectful discussion, the overall understanding of the rules of the sub and trust of each other and the mod team (which we appreciate and don't take lightly!) all of these things are what makes this sub like the City of Athens. We are a thriving community with a strong wall to protect the brilliant minds and civil discourse inside so that knowledge and information can grow. We have to hold the wall so that we can nurture the city. (This is in the essence of the words of our mod u/StonkU2 🤜🤛)</p>
<p>So when you see something that <em>doesn't</em> vibe, and you file a legitimate report against a user, you are contributing to keeping this Great City free of the propaganda that they want to litter our streets with. Mods are not here to control the sub. We are the police. The watchmen. And you can be sure that the watchmen are watching their fellow watchmen. 🧐</p>
<p>Which brings me to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n3l8my/weekend_update_housekeeping/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this statement</a> from our mod, u/redchessqueen99. It describes in detail the <strong>unanimous</strong> decision to remove one of our mods. I don't want to dwell on this, and I will not be making any statements about this. Red has spoken for the entire mod team after much deliberation and conversation. Again, this is a unanimous decision and we stand as a team. YOUR mod team. Our motto is and always will be, ape first, mod second.</p>
<p>Edit: more details on the mod removal can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n3l8my/weekend_update_housekeeping/gwsc6c1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here in u/rensole's comment</a></p>
<p>When y'all tag me in a sus post, I respond as quickly as possible. I screenshot everything, our whole mod team does. We keep receipts for absolutely any mod action we take because we realize the responsibility here. This isn't a regular sub. This is the greatest sub on reddit. 💖💎🙌🚀</p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to continue to report legitimately suspicious activity. I see you 👀 out in the wild, expertly picking out shills from the bushes and defending the integrity of this community. It's like every week this sub and its members level up... and we are getting thrillingly close to the Master Sword here. Keep up the good work! Remember- it's hard to know you're reading history when you're the one writing it. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/bjg7zb84ltw61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e56affd43719551fdd04d4fdaa79f38ced49e8a0"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Be excellent to each other!!!</strong></p>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</strong></p>
<p>Remember the fundamentals of this company.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.</p>
