# Title: The SEC has completely and utterly failed and is therefore not fit for purpose. A regulatory body that does not regulate needs removing or complete reform.

This is sentiment that has been echoed here enough over the last few months, but to see such a body fail so overtly and massively is further proof in the pudding that that the SEC is not only allowing this to happen, but is complicit and promoting it.

The system is designed as such to allow what is happening happen. Their inaction is making the problem worse. Can they not see that the short HFs and market makers are going to try and bring the entire system down with them?

Ginsler will be powerless, he is likely there to appease the masses. I hope I am proved wrong.
The whole GME saga is not gaining any positive traction in MSM and therefore the wider world does not give a flying fuck what is going on in their country. Have the SEC on a personal level no morals or ethics? They are literally allowing the decimation of the lay persons to line the pockets of the mega rich.

What annoys me most, is that nothing will change after this. Money controls money, always has always will.

This was more or a rant than anything and just wanted to promote discussion.

I'd be interested to read if anyone can think of the SEC can redeem itself and if so, how?
