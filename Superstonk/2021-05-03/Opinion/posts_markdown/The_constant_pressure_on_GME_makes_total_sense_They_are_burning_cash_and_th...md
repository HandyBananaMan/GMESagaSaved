#Title: The constant pressure on GME makes total sense. They are burning cash and therefore their liquidity in the accounts is drying up, so they must drive the price down to prevent margin call. Buy. Vote. HODL! 🚀

Everyone loves a good Monday dip for the chips!  I bought more today. The pressure makes sense. They are burning capital through buying more shorts and interest. So in turn, they have to push the price of the stock down to prevent getting margin called. It used to be 350 they were fighting so hard against. Then SLR reverted. So they needed more liquidity to continue to play. Now it’s maybe around 200 last week and maybe 180 this week?  Who really knows anymore. Take the aggressive action as good news. I think we will see more sales before this thing gets popped off. I always hold a little capital for another 200 shares or more. Never can be too sure but I love tickets for the 🌚. Buy the dip, they are losing daily. It costs nothing to HODL!  Love you 🦍!
