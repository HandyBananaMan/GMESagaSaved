Last time we spoke, we talked about Charter Schools and questioned the reason why SO MANY Billionaires we're interested in investing in them.\n\nI'll let you make your own interpretations: [PART 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0isaz/billionaire_boys_club_bbc_part_4_recess_is_over/)\n\nThis time... we are going to talk about the OTHER thing that Billionaires all love to pump money into...\n\n# FOUNDATIONS\n\nNow... don't get me wrong here. I'm sure there are lots of foundations out there that do a lot of good. This is merely an examination of the FUNCTIONALITY of these foundations and why they potentially get so much attention from the super-rich.\n\nLet's start with one we all know...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gktjg5nvm571.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=533ec0528af455a3b5eeeeb05a7866d1cf365efe\n\n# The Bill and Linda Gates Foundation\n\nNow... maybe you already know this, maybe you don't... but Non-Profit Foundations get significant tax breaks from the government... but they still need to report to the IRS through what's called a FORM 990.\n\nSo I decided to look at The Bill and Linda Gates Foundations FORM 990.\n\nSpecifically, their last filled one which was sent in 2020, for year 2019.\n\nSo let's take a look-see...\n\nThe Gates Foundation:\n\n**Received $3.3 BILLION in Contributions** (Makes sense so far)\n\n**Earned $826 million from Dividends and Interest from Securities** (Wait WHAT?)\n\nThe Gates foundation is trading securities?\n\nAm I the only person who didn't know this?\n\n**Gross Sales of all assets of $260 BILLION**\n\n**Net Profit from Sales of Assets of $2 Billion**\n\n**Capital Gains Net Income $6 Billion**\n\n**Net Revenue $6.4 Billion**\n\n**Net Investment Income $7 Billion**\n\nAnd then what are their expense?\n\nTHE BIGGEST ONE...\n\n**Total contributions paid: $5.8 Billion**\n\nMeaning...\n\n**Their NET INCOME was just $320 million**\n\n**But their NET INVESTMENT income is $6.9 BILLION?**\n\nSo they take money in... invest it... pay it back out... but keep the investment profits?\n\n\\+ They don't have to pay capital gains tax as it's a charitable foundation.\n\n\\+ Total Tax Paid on their investment side was $25.6 Million of $7 Billion in Profits!!\n\n\\+ That's a 0.3% tax rate!\n\nBut this COULD be just speculating on high-level numbers right?\n\nNAH...\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey actually break it down for us...\n\n* **Investments in Government Obligations: $8.9 BILLION**\n* **Investment in Corporate Stocks: $33.5 BILLION**\n* **Investment \"Other\" (WTF?):  $5.8 Billion**\n\n**TOTAL ASSETS $50 BILLION**\n\n(That's more than Citadel has AUM)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd they ACTUALLY list this...\n\n**Net Value of NONCHARITABLE-USE ASSETS for 2019?  $47.6 BILLION**\n\nSo MOST of their assets are not actually for Charitable use???\n\nFuck me...\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow much investment has gone into the Gates Foundation?\n\n* **Mr William H Gates? Management Fees $64 million**\n* **Mr William H Gates? Securities $452 million**\n* **Mr William H Gates? $55 Million**\n* **Mr William H Gates and Melinda French Gates? $10.8 million**\n* **Mr Warren Buffett? $2.7 BILLION**\n\n**Non-Cash Property Given**? Class B Berkshire Hathaway Shares valued at\u2026 **$2.7 BILLION**\n\nSo really\u2026 Warren just put in $2.7 Billion of Shares as Assets on their books? I wonder why\u2026 ?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat **CONTROLLED ENTITIES** have they Contributed to?\n\n* **The Global Good Fund $100 Million**\n* **GreenBriar Equity Fund $6 Million**\n\n(These are the only ones they are obliged to document)\n\nContributions from **CONTROLLED ENTITIES**?\n\n* GreenBriar Equity Fund? $174 million\n\nHang on\u2026 lol. Did they just report that they gave GreenBriar $6 million and GreenBriar gave them back $174 million?\n\nNice returns.. lol\n\nLol\u2026 I\u2019m not wrinkled brained enough to know what that means really\u2026 but lol.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've taken on board the feedback that my last BBC was a little depressing... SO\n\nHere's a puppy Break to cheer you up...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5hxsotuym571.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=89a0ee3bf65f351ac919e09439c4d39d57524f8c\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey **EVEN LIST THE STOCKS** that they are invested in\u2026\n\n(Gamestop is not one)\n\nBut look who has got $11.3 Billion? Berkshire Hathaway\n\n(Remember Warren only invested $2.7 Billion)\n\nDisclaimer: I fucking love the shit outta Warren Buffett\n\nOther big numbers:\n\n* **$1.5 Billion in Canadian Natl Railway**\n* **$1.6 Billion in Caterpillar**\n* **$1.3 Billion in Walmart**\n* **$2.2 Billion in Waste Management Inc**\n\nWhat do these stocks have in Common? They are NOT Berkshire Hathaway stocks\u2026 because that would be WAY to obvious. But LOOK like they are nice safe, solid, FUNDAMENTALLY sound positions. I\u2019ll say no more.\n\nThey list their Corporate Bonds too, but nothing stood out to me. Feel free to take a comb through\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# INVESTMENTS OTHER\n\nThis is an interesting little section in the Form 990.\n\nThey actually break down their other investments, which if you remember was listed as a total of $5.8 billion.\n\nSome wrinkle brains should def go through this, as I have no clue what I am looking at, but here are a few points that stood out to me:\n\n* **Citadel is listed on there as a Bank Loan, but for only $1.5 million. Breadcrumbs...**\n* **Bridgewater Pure Alpha Lead was given $87 million listed as a partner? Interesting\u2026**\n* **Canada Housing Trust was given $752 million as a Foreign Government Issue**\n* **China Government Bond and Treasuring were given $750 million, listed as Foreign Government Issues**\n* **100s of Millions went to different pools that I don\u2019t understand**\n* **700 million went into buying PHYSICAL Gold Bars -- WTF Bill? Lol**\n* **$223 million went to GreenBriar as a partnership? (Remember GreenBriar were the ones that donated $174 million earlier)**\n* **100 million went to GTI 8 Institutional Investors (Whoever they are)**\n* **$805 Million went to Mexico CETES what ever that is?**\n\nI think you get the picture right?\n\nNOW\u2026.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are a couple of sections in this document that for some stupid reason are printed **SIDEWAYS**\u2026\n\n(Maybe they want these to be more difficult to read?)\n\nBut I did read one of them\u2026\n\nThis is **TITLED**:\n\nNet Gain or LOSS from Sale of Assets not on Line 10\n\n* Ok, so first up wtf with this as a title?\n* Is this additional revenue that they just don\u2019t have to list at all?\n* How it\u2019s required is just listed as purchased or donated\n* Date Acquired is just listed as **VARIOUS**\n* Date Sold is just listed as **VARIOUS**\n\nBut\u2026 remember that number I threw out right AT THE START OF THIS POST???\n\n(Go on\u2026 check\u2026 I\u2019ll wait - See if you can figure out which number I am referring to?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97r93dt30n571.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=1041de8497a9914909bcc23a24921c0f13c43358\n\nI said\u2026\n\nListed as having **GROSS SALES OF GROSS SALES PRICE OF ALL ASSETS?**\n\nThat number was **$260 BILLION**\u2026\n\nTake that in for a second\u2026\n\nThe total AUM of Citadel is $35 Billion\n\n**$260 Billion is  7 times that size!!**\n\n(I did the math)\n\nWell that $260 BILLION is also listed on one of these SIDEWAYS PAGES that they don\u2019t want us to read\u2026 under Net Gain from Sale of Assets Not on Line 10???\n\nThey even break this down for us! (On a SIDEWAYS PAGE of course)\n\nThe big numbers\u2026 (The ones in the billions) are:\n\n* $11 Billion in Equities\n* $87 Billion in Fixed Income (How is this amount a fixed income)\n* $162 Billion in Cash Equivalents\n\nWHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?\n\nAND THAT\u201dS THE END OF THE REPORT!\n\nSOURCE:  [https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/911663695\\_201912\\_990PF\\_2021021717709925.pdf](https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/911663695_201912_990PF_2021021717709925.pdf)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo it\u2019s safe to say\u2026 that **JUST LIKE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS**, these foundations are all REALLY in the business of making money right? - Just MY OPINION of course\u2026\n\nBut let\u2019s check if the pattern holds true\u2026\n\nI tried looking up different foundations\u2026 and lot\u2019s of the WELL KNOWN foundations, I couldn\u2019t find ANY Form 990s on.\n\n(Sometimes these foundations are known by one name, but listed as a different name)\n\nBut here\u2019s the ones that I have and show a similar pattern:\n\nExample: **The Lynn & Stacy Schusterman Foundation** is **ACTUALLY** listed as Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation\n\n(Charles is the Father, who was an oil Tycoon)\n\n* Donations: $5.7 million\n* Dividends and Interest: $34 million (They invest both directly in companies and through Stocks)\n* Net Gain from Sale of Assets: $151 million\n* Total Revenue $207 million\n* Net Investment Income $197 million\n* Total Assets: $2.2 BILLION\n\nReference: [https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/731312965\\_201912\\_990PF\\_2021021317706329.pdf](https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/731312965_201912_990PF_2021021317706329.pdf)\n\n\\-- I**MPORTANTLY HERE**\u2026 this example lists their PAYEES. Alot of which are foundations themselves.\n\nWant MORE examples?\n\nCharles Koch - Koch Industries\n\n**The Charles Koch Foundation** (Christ, they all name them the same)\n\n* Donations: $128 Million\n* Dividends $15 million\n* Revenue $168 Million\n* Investment Income $39 million\n* \u201cOther\u201d Investments Balance $617 million\n* Total Assets: $685 million\n* What are the \u201cOther\u201d investment?\n* Elliot International Fund $50 mil\n* EFPRP (What ever the fuck this is) $535 million\n* BAIH (What ever the fuck this is) $60 million\n\nSource: [https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/480918408\\_201812\\_990PF\\_2020012117047703.pdf](https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/480918408_201812_990PF_2020012117047703.pdf)\n\nI\u2019m not going to go through ALL of these foundations, because 1\u2026 they are hard to track down due to naming variations\u2026 2\u2026 My Head hurts from reading this shit and being shocked.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s safe to say that it most CERTAINLY is possible that other foundations are doing similar right?\n\nSo let me get this straight\u2026\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRich People, Create Foundations to avoid tax, take in donations, Invest the donations, make profit from the investments, and then donate the incoming donations out to Charter Schools (Which Make them profit), Political Campaigns (Which Gain them influence) or other Foundations (Which likely do the same kind of shit)... and maybe help some people along the way too for some good PR?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs this the world we\u2019re living in?\n\nWho else has a foundation?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut first...
