<p>Back in April, DFV tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1379886701099814915?s=20">a picture of "Boy With Apple".</a> The next day, GameStop announced Ryan Cohen to be chairman.</p>
<p>Today DFV tweets an edited picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_of_Man">"The Son of Man"</a> with Ryan Cohen edited in as the man, and the link between the two portraits, the green apple, now changed to the GameStop logo. </p>
<p>All speculation is mine alone, but it was reported that Ryan Cohen had 6.2 million split-adjusted apple shares as of August 31, 2020. Could this be a sign that perhaps Ryan Cohen will be swapping out his shares of apple and going all in on GME with the help of those funds? As of market close his apple shares alone will equate to about 3.5 million GME shares.</p>
