People need to stop posting about it. I know you might be tired and broke but so are many other people. Whining about it on reddit wont do shit except for make other apes start over thinking or might weaken peoples morale. I hope nobody threw in money they actually depend on but to each their own. Apes will be okay, apes will be rich. It's a matter of time. Wait it out and stay fucking strong!

Edit: it's not in exact words but I'm talking about people who post that they are tired and broke basically lol.
