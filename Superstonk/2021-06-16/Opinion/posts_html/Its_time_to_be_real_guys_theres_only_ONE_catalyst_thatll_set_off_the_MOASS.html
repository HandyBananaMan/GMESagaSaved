<p>I think it's important we have this discussion to bring people back to reality.  Much like alot of people here, I am a January ape and have been deep into the DD and discussions for months now, and with u/criand's post yesterday, I think it's time we have a discussion. And of course, this is not financial advice, yada yada...</p>
<p>For anybody who missed it, here's the post I'm referring to. Read it <strong>multiple</strong> times, this is <strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT DD aside from HOC</strong> that has been posted on this sub:</p>

<p>Now, for awhile we've speculated that GME will moon when the market crashes, but for a long time now, I think we've been looking at it the wrong way. <strong>The market will not crash BECAUSE of GME, the market is doomed to crash ON ITS OWN and GME is the best hedge against the crash you could possibly buy.</strong></p>
<p>Everyday we have a new post speculating what rule is going to be the catalyst or what Ryan Cohen can do to set off the MOASS, but this was never going to be the case. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of RC and what he's doing for Gamestop, and fully believe in his vision moving forward, however, he is there to do what is best for GME. <strong>Setting off the MOASS is NOT what is best for GME.</strong> IMO Ryan is being the smartest ape he can be by keeping his head low, keeping his cards close, and making power moves to keep himself out of the spotlight until the MOASS is over. <strong>Can you imagine the lawsuits Gamestop would incur if something they did set off the MOASS? IT COULD EVEN END THE COMPANY BY DROWNING THEM IN LITIGATION.</strong></p>
<p>"But u/fakeasian, if RC doesn't set off the MOASS, surely it'll be one of the rules they pass, right?"</p>
<p><strong>WRONG.</strong> We're foolish to think that any of these rules are for our benefit. These rules are being created to make a blast shield for the shitshow that's about to occur when the market crashes and to prevent another MOASS from happening in the future. The post I linked goes into detail about this, so if you still haven't read it, even though I told you to, GO FUCKING READ IT.</p>
<p><strong>THE MOASS WAS ONLY AND WILL ONLY OCCUR WHEN A HEDGE FUND GOES UNDER AND IS FORCED TO COVER.</strong> There, I said it.</p>
<p><strong>THE GOOD NEWS</strong> is that we are ABSOLUTELY doing damage. We know they're bleeding and getting more desperate and if u/criand is right, shit is about to hit the fan when all those commercial loans are allowed to default on June 30th. I know we don't talk dates, but the market is clearly freaking out and the powers that be know this is coming because of all the rules they passed to shield themselves. <strong>ALL IT WILL TAKE IS ONE HEDGIE TO GO UNDER, BE FORCED TO COVER, AND THE REST OF THE DOMINOS WILL FALL.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>  I've gotta say that the last 6 months have been the most fun I've ever had on the internet and I love all you guys but <strong>IM FUCKING TIRED.</strong>  I know I cant be the only one, and I'm just worried about apes, especially new apes getting burnt out when we're really close to the end. <strong>THERE IS NOTHING ANY OF US OR RYAN COHEN CAN DO TO START THE MOASS. WE NEED TO JUST WAIT PATIENTLY UNTIL HEDGE FUNDS BLEED OUT AND GET LIQUIDATED, THEN IT'S GAME ON.</strong> The thesis remains the same.  They can't bring the price down if we continue to buy and hold. Just keep a level head, breathe, be patient, and most importantly, <strong>BUY. HOLD. JACK YOUR TITS. WE ARE IN THE ENDGAME (AGAIN).</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: For those of you saying RC has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders, you aren't wrong, but they've already done their part. RC came in and ensured that Gamestop isn't going under and raised a buttload of capital to make moves with. <strong>THIS WAS THE START OF SETTING OFF THE MOASS. If RC didn't step in and save GS from bankruptcy, we wouldn't be here right now.</strong> RC has done his part, now we just need to buy and hold until a hedge fund bleeds out and is forced to cover.</p>
