<p>Everyone is assuming that Dave is going to go on CNBC and support the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-2021-06-16/">reuters article</a> stating that dark pool trading is affecting supply/demand in a way that impacts retail traders. I think he's mentioned in the past that this is not true due to the way NBBO operates. I could be wrong, but we should manage our expectations.</p>
<p>If he does offer a counter to the article, it's honestly fine. The fact that the discussion is being had is good and provides momentum for GME. It may further offer a platform for him to address the massive FTD problem that keeps giving us buying opportunities week over week. Buy and hold.</p>
<p>EDIT: Many thanks to u/Retardnoobstonk. I should have said "hampers price discovery" instead of saying that it affects supply/demand.</p>
<p>Also looks like Dave <strong>does share the opinion of the article,</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1lciqa/high_speed_trading_impact_on_retail_investors_and/cby0qn7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">which he shared</a> in r/finance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the existence of dark pools is hampering price discovery because of how much market share they've gotten. I think dark pools that do shady things, like provide cross-connects or use SIP to price NBBO, while the broker's HFT/prop desk uses direct feeds, is harming investors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still don't know what he'll say, but a little cautious optimism never hurt anyone.</p>
