Everyone is assuming that Dave is going to go on CNBC and support the [reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-2021-06-16/) stating that dark pool trading is affecting supply/demand in a way that impacts retail traders. I think he's mentioned in the past that this is not true due to the way NBBO operates. I could be wrong, but we should manage our expectations.

If he does offer a counter to the article, it's honestly fine. The fact that the discussion is being had is good and provides momentum for GME. It may further offer a platform for him to address the massive FTD problem that keeps giving us buying opportunities week over week. Buy and hold.

EDIT: Many thanks to u/Retardnoobstonk. I should have said "hampers price discovery" instead of saying that it affects supply/demand.

Also looks like Dave **does share the opinion of the article,** [which he shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1lciqa/high_speed_trading_impact_on_retail_investors_and/cby0qn7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in r/finance.

>I think the existence of dark pools is hampering price discovery because of how much market share they've gotten. I think dark pools that do shady things, like provide cross-connects or use SIP to price NBBO, while the broker's HFT/prop desk uses direct feeds, is harming investors.

We still don't know what he'll say, but a little cautious optimism never hurt anyone.
