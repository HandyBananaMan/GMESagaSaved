*Alright guys...*

The first edition of today's JBeat contained a correction that 005 was not in effect just yet, and followed up with a link to the DTCC website to confirm. Well, that info was wrong. So I have deleted the part of the post relevant to that discovery.

We are back to where we hoped we were.

# Superstonk Community Award Contest!

# What are Community Awards?

Regular "awards" are purchased with **Coins**, a mechanism of Reddit that ultimately requires real money to purchase packs of coins that can then be spent on awards for posts and comments. [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) does not receive any money when they are purchased, but it does receive Coins when users gift Community Awards.

>Community Awards are unique to each community, and members can give them to each other. Moderators can design and name the Awards however they want.A portion of Coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited to the community’s Coin balance. Moderators can use Coins from that balance to reward members with Mod Awards. The Coin balance is shown only to moderators in the community’s sidebar.

Moderators do NOT have access to the [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) coin bank other than to give Community Awards on this sub to quality posts and comments. Moderators do NOT receive any coins personally, and only certain mods with permissions can access the coin bank for this purpose.

**Community Award:** Any user can gift this award for an amount of Coins (min. 500) to a post or comment. Each of these awards will also gift Coins to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) itself, allowing mods to give mod-exclusive awards. For example, a 500 Coin Community Award also gives the subreddit 100 Coins.

**Mod-Exclusive Community Award:** These awards are purchased using the Coins available only to mods from the [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) Coin bank, and give a certain amount of Reddit Premium to the recipient. For example, a 1800 Coin Mod-Exclusive Community Award will grant one month of Reddit Premium.

*Reddit Premium gives 700 monthly coins, access to Premium Awards, and more. Learn about it here:* [*https://www.reddit.com/premium*](https://www.reddit.com/premium)

Currently, we have two Community Awards: the **Superstonk Award** (500 Coins, giftable by members), and the **Not-A-Cat Golden Bananya Award** (1800 Coins, giftable by mods only).

# Award Contest

We ask you, [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) members and lurkers, to use your best design skills to create award icons that we can then place into the Community Awards. You will need to think of a great name, too, but note we must keep it (mostly) family friendly. We are limiting to one design/name per submission, so make it good!

**The top eight designs will be made into the following awards:**

* **5th-8th:** Community Award (cost: 500 Coins, 100 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))
* **4th:** Community Award (cost: 1000 Coins, 200 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))
* **3rd:** Community Award (cost: 2000 Coins, 400 to [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/))
* **2nd:** Mod-Exclusive Award for 1-month Premium (mod cost: 1800 Coins)
* **1st:** Mod-Exclusive Award for 3-month Premium (mod cost: 5400 Coins)

Additionally, **1st and 2nd place will receive FOUR of the new 3-month Premium mod-exclusive awards** on their top posts and/or comments, **3rd and 4th place will receive ONE of the new 3-month Premium mod-exclusive award**, and **5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th place will each receive ONE of the new 1-month Premium mod-exclusive award**. This will effectively win you Coins and Premium membership, as well as serious clout from designing an official sub award.

To submit, please follow the guidelines below.
