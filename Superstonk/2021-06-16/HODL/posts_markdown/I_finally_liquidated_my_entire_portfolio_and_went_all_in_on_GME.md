I’m just really jacked up right now lol. Every position is gone (except for one share in a company I will never sell to “remind me” of a bad decision lol) and I’m completely all in on GME. The thing is, it’s not just about the short interest or the craziness of the situation regarding decades of corruption between banks, hedge funds, and the fed. I truly believe in the man. Ryan Cohen. I am absolutely certain he will shape GameStop into something far beyond what we’re expecting to see in the company. He’s a god damn genius, and my only regret is I didn’t see it sooner and go all in at a more attractive price point. Regardless, I’m all in now. 

Let’s fucking go baby!!!
