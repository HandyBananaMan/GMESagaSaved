Every position is gone (except for one share in a company I will never sell to \u201cremind me\u201d of a bad decision lol) and I\u2019m completely all in on GME. The thing is, it\u2019s not just about the short interest or the craziness of the situation regarding decades of corruption between banks, hedge funds, and the fed. I truly believe in the man. Ryan Cohen. I am absolutely certain he will shape GameStop into something far beyond what we\u2019re expecting to see in the company. He\u2019s a god damn genius, and my only regret is I didn\u2019t see it sooner and go all in at a more attractive price point. Regardless, I\u2019m all in now. \n\nLet\u2019s fucking go baby!!!",
