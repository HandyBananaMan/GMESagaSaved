Now before I get called a mayonnaise slinging shill hear me out. 

This hasn't stopped me from buying, hodling and voting. This is simply a discussion I want to start to further harden our diamond hands ðŸ’ŽâœŠ. 

For months now apes have been telling themselves to hold and expect nothing, prepare for everything. This includes putting all your faith in specific dates. I believe the veteran apes have already been tried and tested but for the new apes out there. 6/9 is NOT the MOASS date, just because people are hyped about the meeting doesn't mean it's when MOASS will start/happen. 

If you think for a second all your time and effort hinges on this date. You are playing yourself and I wouldn't be surprised if you become a paper hand. Remember to expect NOTHING.

HODL ðŸ’Ž

Edit 1: Thanks for the awards! I actually didn't see a previous post (maybe 20-30 mins) older than this.

Edit 2: I have seen a few comments saying this is fud. Sorry if it appears that way. But patience is key.

Edit 3: thanks for all of the awards and comments guys and gals. I am lovin6the discussions going on below.

Edit 4: a fellow ape brought up a similar topic yesterday on the daily https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nr819f/gme_daily_discussion_june_03_2021/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share a Yokashi-Monta, it's a different take on what would happen on 6/9 take the time to read it and come up with your own thoughts

Edit 5: Got that dreaded message from reddit, been reported for 'suicidal thoughts'. Looks like I triggered a couple of man children.
