Yesterday there were two big things that happened that may not seem related initially, but our awesome DD has helped to uncover their relation.

**1. Jefferies ceased short selling of GME (and the popcorn stock)**

Jefferies is a brokerage used by hedge funds for trading, and it's largely owned by...BlackRock and Vanguard!

**2. Borrowed shares have disappeared and are not being replenished**

There have been two posts discussing that BlackRock (and likely also Vanguard) have been lending out shares for SHF to dig a bigger hole (and make some tendies for themselves). Those borrowed shares have dried up.

I think this is no coincidence and, for some reason, they felt like now is the right time to start clamping down on this shorting bullshit.
