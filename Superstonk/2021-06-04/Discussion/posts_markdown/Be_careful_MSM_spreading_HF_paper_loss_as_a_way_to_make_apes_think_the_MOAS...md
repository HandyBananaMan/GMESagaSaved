I was wondering why they keep spreading everywhere news about HFs ”losing” x billions.They want people think the MOASS is over and just sell.

Well, if hedgies lost all that money, who got them ? Did you ?

Nobody is closing position, either covering shorts or selling stonks. NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED YET.

We do have a huge potential of gains and the hedgies have a huge potential of losses which will be exercised during MOASS.

So as far hedgies are not going bankrupt, everything is still on paper.
