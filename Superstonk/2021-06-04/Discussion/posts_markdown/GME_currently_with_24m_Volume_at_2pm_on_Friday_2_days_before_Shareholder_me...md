# Title: GME currently with 2.4m Volume at 2pm on Friday, 2 days before Shareholder meeting. Other "meme" Stocks that supposedly trending together trading at multiple times their daily volume. This is such evidence that retails is NOT a factor of the recent rise at all. GME is the only remaining STONK.

The obvious difference in volume of GME and others in the group is telling me that majority of trade volume that drive up the prices of these stocks come from institutions and other giants. Yes, there is definitely fomo buyers and day traders but that wouldn't account for even a tiny percent. So what that means is what we seeing with huge volumes could be shorts covering, and/or they pumping to hedge their positions against GME short position. And they are definitely NOT covering GME or even letting go of that short button.

My opinion is simply echoing what  u/myplayprofile said in her 2 DD posts, and I think they doing the same tactic on several rising stocks right now. So I believe GME has now separated itself from the pack, yes the prices might move similar like they have been, but GME is now 100% different. There is only one Stonk remained. Super Stonk.

I'm not predicting future prices or anything here, nor do I tell you to do anything. I'm just stating my opinion of GME being the ONE and ONLY stonk on its own now; further confirm my bias of others being distractions, because I started in January buying in the hype of meme stocks, heavily invested in 4 of them, got caught holding since, but now there is only ONE.

TLDR- Don't get distracted, nothing changed the past 2 weeks, GME volume is still tiny like 2 weeks ago, shorts are shorting more, and very few real ppl actually bought into or FOMO into amc or bb or others, it's all institutions and their media playing games.
