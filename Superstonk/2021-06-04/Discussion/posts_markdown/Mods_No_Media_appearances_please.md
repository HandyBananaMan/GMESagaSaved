Trey Trades just got quoted out of context in a headline about AMC. 

It doesn’t matter what you think of him, or AMC, we have to watch what CNBC did to him and learn.

The media aren’t our friends! Not most of them anyway. 

Mods, please freeze out any requests for appearances, comments, or anything else from media sources that are clearly against us.

Freeze them out just like RC is freezing them out.
