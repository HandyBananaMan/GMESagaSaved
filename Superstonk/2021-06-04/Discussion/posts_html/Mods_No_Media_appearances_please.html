<p>Trey Trades just got quoted out of context in a headline about AMC. </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you think of him, or AMC, we have to watch what CNBC did to him and learn.</p>
<p>The media aren’t our friends! Not most of them anyway. </p>
<p>Mods, please freeze out any requests for appearances, comments, or anything else from media sources that are clearly against us.</p>
<p>Freeze them out just like RC is freezing them out.</p>
