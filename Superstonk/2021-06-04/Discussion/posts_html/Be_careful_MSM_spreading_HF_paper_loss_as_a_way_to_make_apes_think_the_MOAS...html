<p>I was wondering why they keep spreading everywhere news about HFs ”losing” x billions.They want people think the MOASS is over and just sell.</p>
<p>Well, if hedgies lost all that money, who got them ? Did you ?</p>
<p>Nobody is closing position, either covering shorts or selling stonks. NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED YET.</p>
<p>We do have a huge potential of gains and the hedgies have a huge potential of losses which will be exercised during MOASS.</p>
<p>So as far hedgies are not going bankrupt, everything is still on paper.</p>
