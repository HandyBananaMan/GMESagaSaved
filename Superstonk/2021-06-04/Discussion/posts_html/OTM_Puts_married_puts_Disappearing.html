<p>Hi everybody</p>
<p>Is it just me or there are OTM puts disappearing?</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/5ksxe5vg69371.png?width=2658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf801074e1885d69e386dfdfe7ff49aa8ae153af">OTM puts (married puts) disappearing?</a></p>
<p>It is my believe that 2021-07-16 we had \~300k+ OTM puts and 2022-01-21 we had \~200k+ OTM puts.</p>
<p>Why is this important? bcs this one of the identified illegal methods that SHF had to hide SI and reset FTDs.</p>
<p>What this means? I have no idea but speculating a little bit here we might have some OCC action over those overwriting of puts (Melvin maybe? i saw a post where his location was permanent closed in google). Could it be the SARS situation where gamestop forced some dumb ass to be taken down?</p>
<p>If so what will happen with \~300k+ put contracts (married puts)? this is \~30M+ shares that must be handled somehow (cover time?)</p>
<p>Can someone please check this in a greater detail?</p>
<p>Stay strong apes.</p>

<p>EDIT 1:</p>
<p>BEGIN</p>
<p>u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Itschyaboiii/">Itschyaboiii</a> have shared an great question in a financial stackexchange forum:</p>
<p><img alt="https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/39586/exercise-an-out-of-the-money-option" src="https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/39586/exercise-an-out-of-the-money-option" /></p>
<p>There we can read that it is possible to exercise OTM option contracts and one of the reasons for that is:</p>
<p><strong>You want a large stake of voting shares</strong> at any price without moving the  market and could not get enough options contracts at a near the money  strike price, so you decided to go out of the money. <strong>Then exercised all  the contracts and suddenly you have a large influential position in the  stock and nobody saw it coming.</strong> This may be favorable if the paper loss  is less than the loss of time value that would have been incurred if you  chose contracts near the money at further expiration dates, in search  of liquidity.</p>
<p>This post is from Nov 13 2014 so i would say is not some FUD / Shill work there.</p>
<p>u/pinkcatsonacid do you think we can get this to Dr. T or u/dlauer and see if this is even possible and can be related to the upcoming shareholder voting.</p>
<p>END</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>
<p>As of 2021-06-07 they have reappeared. check image bellow. Not sure what happened, maybe it was a glitch. Either way i consider this issue close and done.</p>
<p>2021-07-16 -&gt; OTM PUTS = 392,939 \~= 39 Million shares</p>
<p>2022-01-21 -&gt; OTM PUTS = 262,255 \~= 26 Million shares</p>
