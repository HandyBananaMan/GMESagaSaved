<p>Yesterday there were two big things that happened that may not seem related initially, but our awesome DD has helped to uncover their relation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>1. Jefferies ceased short selling of GME (and the popcorn stock)</strong></p>
<p>Jefferies is a brokerage used by hedge funds for trading, and it's largely owned by...BlackRock and Vanguard!</p>

<p><strong>2. Borrowed shares have disappeared and are not being replenished</strong></p>
<p>There have been two posts discussing that BlackRock (and likely also Vanguard) have been lending out shares for SHF to dig a bigger hole (and make some tendies for themselves). Those borrowed shares have dried up.</p>

<p>I think this is no coincidence and, for some reason, they felt like now is the right time to start clamping down on this shorting bullshit.</p>
