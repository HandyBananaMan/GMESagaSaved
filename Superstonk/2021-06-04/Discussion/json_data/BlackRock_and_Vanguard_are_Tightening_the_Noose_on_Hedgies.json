    "selftext": "Yesterday there were two big things that happened that may not seem related initially, but our awesome DD has helped to uncover their relation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. Jefferies ceased short selling of GME (and the popcorn stock)**\n\nJefferies is a brokerage used by hedge funds for trading, and it's largely owned by...BlackRock and Vanguard!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrgdlo/this\\_is\\_huge\\_news\\_investment\\_banking\\_company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrgdlo/this_is_huge_news_investment_banking_company/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrwju5/institutions\\_own\\_74\\_of\\_jeffries\\_financial\\_group](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrwju5/institutions_own_74_of_jeffries_financial_group/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Borrowed shares have disappeared and are not being replenished**\n\nThere have been two posts discussing that BlackRock (and likely also Vanguard) have been lending out shares for SHF to dig a bigger hole (and make some tendies for themselves). Those borrowed shares have dried up.\n\n[https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/about.php](https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/about.php)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mutwug/blackrock\\_lending\\_piles\\_of\\_gme\\_shares\\_at](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mutwug/blackrock_lending_piles_of_gme_shares_at/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n2jdy6/update\\_blackrock\\_is\\_about\\_to\\_delete\\_shitadel\\_out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n2jdy6/update_blackrock_is_about_to_delete_shitadel_out/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is no coincidence and, for some reason, they felt like now is the right time to start clamping down on this shorting bullshit.",
