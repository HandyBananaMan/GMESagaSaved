Did you ?\n\nNobody is closing position, either covering shorts or selling stonks. NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe do have a huge potential of gains and the hedgies have a huge potential of losses which will be exercised during MOASS.\n\nSo as far hedgies are not going bankrupt, everything is still on paper.",
