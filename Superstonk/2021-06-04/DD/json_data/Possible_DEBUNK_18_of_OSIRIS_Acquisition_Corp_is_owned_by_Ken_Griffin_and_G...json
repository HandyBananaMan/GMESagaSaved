Teaming up for a juicy Q&A with Kenny G in the back of a Walmart parking lot, **it seems we got bamboozled**.\n\nFirst, Check out this **JUICY** piece of information, straight from the  Osiris Acquisition Corp IPO:\n\n *\"It may pursue an* ***initial business combination target*** *in any business or industry, with a primary focus on targets that possess* ***recognizable brand franchises*** ***in the*** ***Consumer, Retail and Leisure sectors****\"*\n\nGuess what company operates in the retail sector, has a very recognizeable brand, and is undergoing fundamental changes right now? You guessed it, GME. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot going to lie, I wanted to check if I can buy shares or warrants in the Osiris Acquisition Corp , since that could be the \"Tombstone\" merger that the RC tweet hinted at. Turns out, if you check the **latest** **Schedule 13G filing (signed May 28th)** (a report that states ownership above 5%) you'll see the following:\n\n1. GFNCI LLC - 2,070,000 Shares - 9%\n2. Kenny G - 2,070,029 Shares - 9%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0x64we048371.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=7153b81de67643908fe36ef327b1855efa202dfd\n\nGFNCI LLC is registered under the same address as Citadel, so my guess is that these are related, at the minimum. The document was also signed on behalf of Mr. Kenneth Griffin by Mr. Gregory Johnson,  who received a power of attorney when **Citadel** filed a 13G for \"Jaws Acquisitions Corp\", on the 1st of February, 2021:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grp0h9av48371.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=f845eb11fc275e2aa0bafa4f57eb0d36a49ab3c7\n\nThis SPAC could be anything, or nothing, so dont get too excited. But this leaves me with two possible theoretical scenarios, **if** Osiris Acquisition Corp is even connected to GME at all:\n\n1. They gave Kenny&Co a get out of jail free card. If GME somehow links up with OSI, and he owns 18% of OSI, then he might get burned (on the shorts), but might stay alive on the long side.\n2. This has nothing to do with GME at all. In this case I find it interesting that Citadel chose to buy into this specific SPAC, especially with all the links pointing to a good relationship between Jeffries and Gamestop. **I wonder how much of a firewall there is between different departments at Jeffries.**\n\nLet me know what you think. I feel like there is more to it, but this is as far as I got.",
