<p>You like pizza parties? I like pizza parties and I bet you do too. So why the fuck weren't we invited to the pizza party Blackrock and company are throwing on June 18?</p>
<p>Let me explain, but first what does anyone know about Junk bonds? Specifically, corporate junk bonds?</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/pmjkevvga9371.jpg?width=657&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a543e8d43412eba40ba6abbfecb8d3b3a161e49</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know much either, except that they seem to blow up when the market blows up. Why does this matter? Two reason ... 1) Our favorite little video game retailer looks like it might take a blowtorch to the face of the market upon liftoff, and 2) Because there's this little corporate junk bond vehicle called HYG — IShares IBOXX $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF.</p>
<p>What's HYG look like during market turmoil?</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/8dvyp3d9d9371.png?width=2462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6fe84e4713a073f6ff40385aa4c3408d10867b</p>
<p>See that crash. That was the start of the pandemic. HYG tanks with volume. Crazy, right?</p>
<p>So let me back up ...</p>
<p>I was looking through Citadel's and Blackrock's filings on WhaleWisdom as every wrinkled ape should. I was trying to figure out if there were any shared positions figuring whatever they might have in common, it can't possibly go tits up, right?</p>
<p>Something curious about Blackrock ... you really have to dig deep to find anything other than long share positions. In fact, not a single one of their largest positions in $$$$ is in options. Take look: <a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/blackrock-inc#tabholdings_tab_link">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/blackrock-inc#tabholdings_tab_link</a></p>
<p>Citadel, on the other hand, nothing but options as far as the eye can see. They love the shit (probably because it's easy to run complex shenanigans with derivatives).</p>
<p>It's almost like Blackrock and Citadel have this arrangement ... Blackrock buys and holds the shares then lends them to Citadel so they can short them, rehypothicate them, do all kinds of fuckery in options, etc. to fuck over retail investors. Blackrock has Citadel by the balls, Citadel has retail investors by the balls, ya-da-ya-da-ya-da.</p>
<p>Speaking of options, the second largest option position for Blackrock is a Put position, on HYG. Guess what, Citadel also has a big Put position on HYG. Even more curious, both of them just added to this position recently, and so did a bunch of the other major players. Check it out:</p>

<p>Blackrock also dumped a bunch of shares:</p>

<p>Wow, I thought. I'd like to see these options in action. So I started searching through HYG's option chain.</p>
<p>June 4:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/juvavg9nc9371.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dda80a88f983fb1338618ea649a7f344db07c4be">A little bit of action here, but nothing crazy.</a></p>
<p>June 11:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/22c35w3uc9371.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e504bbc79939f1cdabcbdadbb6a5c77c96daf374">Again, not much to see here.</a></p>
<p>June 25:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/h889570zc9371.png?width=1178&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd4efe093ee87cc95a9ecd12f60e2fac1b02a3ee">Again, nothing doing.</a></p>
<p>Wait, what about June 18? I forgot June 18:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/hz6zjipyd9371.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc53ffaff99188f66f34c98cc9dc6b7948db721e</p>

<p>How is it that a stock that does 20MM in daily volume has an option day with (at a glance) 2MM+ contracts (that's like 200 million shares). That's like $4B. And if HYG tanks hard (like -$10/share), the value of these Puts could be more like $200B (math in my ape head). The numbers just go up and up depending on how hard it crashes. <strong>And look at how LOW the premium is on these options.</strong> Absolutely no volatility (until there is, right?).</p>
<p>Now, we're all familiar with how married puts can be used to hide FTDs. And HYG has FTDs ...</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/2bkeq8ufe9371.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=633f7fb9d7a40f412ea180897a0c4c141adfae46</p>
<p>So this takes me back to pizza parties, and why we weren't invited to the June 18th party. I actually have no idea how to trade this. All I know is if the market goes boom, and volume spikes in HYG, it tanks hard and fast. But if all these Puts are to hide FTDs and kick the can down the road, a tanking market might not be in the cards at all. There's also some more crazy options action on July 16.</p>
<p>So what is all this? Are all these funds planning on cashing in on a total market blow up happening sometime between now and June 18. Is GME the catalyst? Or is everyone playing option games now?</p>
<p>All I do know is I can't stop thinking about this scene from True Romance.</p>

<p>Another thing ... in looking at the different positions between Citadel and Blackrock ... if they are not buddies and they're not planning on playing nice, Citadel looks vulnerable when it comes to Facebook. It's Citadel's largest share position by $$$$ amount ($850MM), and Blackrock owns $46B in FB. In one fell swoop, Blackrock could recall all its shares while at the same time dumping/tanking FB. What would you do then, Mr. Mayo? There's no fudging share value like with options (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfczb2/even_more_cheat_codes_so_much_options_fuckery/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfczb2/even_more_cheat_codes_so_much_options_fuckery/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a>). If FB tanks, it would be hard for Citadel to make that go away on their balance sheet. Furthermore, both BR and Citadel have been reducing their FB positions. You know who else has been reducing their position in Facebook? Our boy MZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/j02f8eszf9371.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c043af7ba2619185fe354a163dd58b249a4ab6b">Why no like FB anymore, Mark?</a></p>
<p>Yeah, all that red ... it's him. He's been dumping 50K-70K shares a day since November. Sustained selling. Very sustained selling.</p>
<p>Citadel also looks vulnerable on Amazon too. Divorce court, anyone? And if you read between the lines on Bezos' 2020 shareholder letter, it almost sounds like the party is coming to an end (<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders</a>). Both FB and Amazon have some interesting June 18 Put action too.</p>
<p>Anyway, a lot to process here, I know. But I'll give it a try (and then I need to work):</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR — There is a crazy amount of open interest on HYG (Corporate Junk Bonds) for June 18. Seems like everyone has a piece of it (except maybe GS). Looks like a pizza party, so I thought everyone should know about it. In order for all these Puts to print, the market is going to have to completely melt down (GME moonshot?). Or maybe these are being used to bury a bunch of FTDs and keep the party going. I have no fucking idea, but maybe someone else does. At any rate, I'm long HYG Puts, long HYG calls, short FB, and I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. None of this is financial advice, and do your own research, man!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit #1: Check out June 18 options on JNK ... same thing as HYG ... lots of Put action in June 18, nothing else on any other date.</strong></p>

<p>More convinced than ever there's going to be some sort of a blow up in the corporate junk bond market ahead of June 18.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #2 (night of June 10): Something interesting about GME and VIX in link below. VIX almost at max bearish position. Global markets at all time highs. Reverse repo maxing out. Something's gotta give, seems like.</strong></p>
