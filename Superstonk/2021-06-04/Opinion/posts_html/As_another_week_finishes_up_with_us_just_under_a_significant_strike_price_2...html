<h1>Title: As another week finishes up with us just under a significant strike price ($250) I would like to remind all Apes that the single biggest options market to retail investors is made by Citadel - when your calls finish OTM, your money goes straight to the shorts.</h1>

<p>Title says is all, just wanted to remind people of that fact.</p>
<p>Options are tempting, especially the weeklies, they feel like leveraged lottery tickets, <strong>but</strong> <em>that is under normal circumstances</em>. These circumstances are not normal - every time you get it wrong, you are giving liquidity to the shorts to make their margin calls. I'm speaking from experience. Lots of wasted money in February and March.</p>
<p>Put another way: STOCKS ONLY. Buy. Hold. Vote.</p>
<p>If you read the DD and come to the same conclusion of course, I'm not a financial adviser.</p>
