<p>Which one is it? Are we treating the market like a casino or are we treating it like a long-term investment vehicle for wealth creation? Can’t have it both ways yet the dishonest financial media paints it that way. Buffet buys and holds stocks. Does he treat the market like a casino? You know people are snakes when they accuse you of contradictory things.</p>
