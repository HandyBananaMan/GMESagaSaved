Which one is it? Are we treating the market like a casino or are we treating it like a long-term investment vehicle for wealth creation? Canâ€™t have it both ways yet the dishonest financial media paints it that way. Buffet buys and holds stocks. Does he treat the market like a casino? You know people are snakes when they accuse you of contradictory things.
