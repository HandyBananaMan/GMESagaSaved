#Title: As another week finishes up with us just under a significant strike price ($250) I would like to remind all Apes that the single biggest options market to retail investors is made by Citadel - when your calls finish OTM, your money goes straight to the shorts.

Title says is all, just wanted to remind people of that fact.

Options are tempting, especially the weeklies, they feel like leveraged lottery tickets, **but** *that is under normal circumstances*. These circumstances are not normal - every time you get it wrong, you are giving liquidity to the shorts to make their margin calls. I'm speaking from experience. Lots of wasted money in February and March.

Put another way: STOCKS ONLY. Buy. Hold. Vote.

If you read the DD and come to the same conclusion of course, I'm not a financial adviser.
