These circumstances are not normal - every time you get it wrong, you are giving liquidity to the shorts to make their margin calls. I'm speaking from experience. Lots of wasted money in February and March.\n\nPut another way: STOCKS ONLY. Buy. Hold. Vote.\n\nIf you read the DD and come to the same conclusion of course, I'm not a financial adviser.",
