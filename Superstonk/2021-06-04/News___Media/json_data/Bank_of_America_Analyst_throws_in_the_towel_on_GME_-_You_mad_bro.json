    "selftext": "This analyst has been against GME since 2020. I'm guessing when BofA wanted a piece of the pie and started shorting the analyst did his job.\n\nSorry about the source - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/bank-of-america-analyst-throws-in-the-towel-on-meme-stocks-says-fundamentals-are-not-driving-shares.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2dpotap4a9371.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5df730c5828aa527dde2a5c747ebd66915aadf\n\nThis dude has been shitting on GME for a while but I guess since now the price is higher he \"Throws in the towel\" ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38od2vp9a9371.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=9977db3a119f0a7b911e202aedc0015756a53bf9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3amhz5ba9371.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fba3014edb32e07f4f8a07479e5cf8da7f3249b\n\nOh yes, this is because the retailers are manipulating the price right? /s\n\nFuck off MSM, I just thought I'd share because all of the Negative MSM news just further confirms my bias that we are right with our DD. They never have counter DD or anything constructive or factual that proves us wrong.\n\nI'm also a firm believer that this FUD isn't to stop us but the average non-redditor . Apes hold and we know the drill. But they will just keep suppressing this as long as they can to keep \"outsiders\" blind to the situation.\n\nLiterally everyday we uncover something and its insane to see this shit unravel. Everything is like clockwork and I can't wait for a well written and casted movie so the people I care about have an easily digestible way to see what us apes have endured.\n\nBuy . hold and obviously vote if you haven't!\n\nEnjoy your weekend after today, don't get overly hyped on the 6/9 dates and stay safe!\n\nEdit: adding this guys meme LOL - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ns8nea/nonfudamental\\_factors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ns8nea/nonfudamental_factors/)",
