If you notice edited or deleted posts on your account, or cannot login, this is likely a sign that you have been the victim of a dastardly shillfiltrator.\n\nThis is possible due to someone logging into your account if it has a weak password, having clicked mysterious links, or other creative methods utilized by bad actors. Therefore, I am writing some quick security tips for moving forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[010101ook1010011ookook](https://preview.redd.it/fs2adorboc371.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb01be5d235d8f0ab3a782e3e588684a64d6f826)\n\nHere are some tips for keeping your account secure:\n\n1. Use an email or Google/Apple account that **does not match your username.** Your username is public, so remember that anyone can enter it just like you, or add [\"@gmail.com](mailto:%22@gmail.com)/@appe.com\" and either try to guess your password, or use a program to make attempts.\n2. [**Enable TFA / 2FA (Two Factor Authentication)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7spq3s/protect_your_account_with_twofactor_authentication/) with your reddit/Google/Apple account; this will require you to link your account to an email, phone number, or authenticator app, and any logins will require typing in a text/email/authenticator code to login. If someone tries to use this, you will receive the notification and become aware of the attempt immediately.\n3. **Be very careful with messages** received via reddit messages, chats, and especially links sent to you. These can be very dangerous as they can take you to fake sites or track your IP address. We also know that, because bad actors cannot post or comment, they switch to chats/messages, which we cannot track or moderate. You should consider any private message to be potentially suspect moving forward.\n4. Use a [**VPN service**](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vpn-services)  \n (ProtonVPN / NordVPN / others, please do your research on best option); VPN's basically turn your internet connection from YOU---REDDIT into YOU---VPN---REDDIT, so any attempts to track you are filtered through a middleman server. The best VPNs are available for a modest monthly or annual cost; you can also use the browser Tor for a crowd-shared VPN of sorts.\n5. Finally, make sure your password is complicated enough so that hacker programs cannot easily crack them. For example, do not use \"password123\" or even \"ilikethestock\" but rather \"MoNkE2021StOnKsGoUp4p3$t063th3r$tr0n6\" - make them work for it. Every second we waste is a second we gain.\n6. If all else fails, and you find yourself a victim of hacking, you will need to resolve through reddit. You can [recover a username](https://www.reddit.com/username) or [get more information about security](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008917491-Account-Security), but also you can [contact reddit admins for assistance](https://www.reddit.com/contact/).\n\n**Why would they target us?**\n\nDoes this really need an answer? We are exposing their dirty laundry for the world to see. Therefore, it is cost-effective for them to spend money on professionals to try and destabilize the sub. Additionally, many trolls and bad actors exist on reddit who would love to see us break apart and fall. Our Approved Users list can also be discovered and they may be targeting our Satori-sanctioned apes in an attempt to undermine its use.\n\nTherefore, we all need to be extra careful, especially with the MOASS impending. I would not forgive myself if I was lazy in regards to keeping you all informed and protected. As mods, we truly understand the importance of your safety and protection, and this is why we are working diligently to keep your educated on the dangers and to implement new technology in an effort to counter their attacks.\n\nPlease leave comments if I missed anything and I will try to make sure I see it and update this post.\n\nLet's make sure the rocket isn't sabotaged. *Moon soon*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack to u/pinkcatsonacid\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6b9p6oz3ra371.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f03078463ea5bdfa8089ddaf53389e6efb905f77\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**As you may have heard, Benzinga wrote an article about our AMA this week with Lucy Komisar and Wes Christian!!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd as you may have heard, yours truly has been invited onto a Mainstream Stock show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Yes** it was super dope they wrote an article about Superstonk Live!\n\n**Yes** it was super mcnasty dope to see my name in MSM print!\n\n**Yes** it was ultimate supreme dope to know that we are gaining exposure!!\n\n**No**, I will not be doing any mainstream interviews at this time, *unless they are directly and exclusively discussing the issue of Naked Short Selling.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich I have a feeling, this won't be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo while I am truly, seriously honored that I was so well received that an offer for an on air interview was warranted, I will await direct confirmation that this is discussing Naked Short Selling on Benzinga before engaging.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it is, then buckle up, buckos.\n\nBut if not, buzz off, Benzinga. \u270c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/muifsf1exa371.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=890da5bbb8febce32994fa96da60132bf8b08bc2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**My Diamond Whistle Blower OP, for those who haven't seen.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms6yvq/blowing_my_diamond_whistle_as_a_highly_visible/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhatever happens, I'll keep you updated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*A note on MSM: My comment from a post yesterday:*\n\n*I know it's exciting and cool to see our name in lights (my husband is probably going to print the benzinga article from today and put it on the fridge lol) but this post is an important message to remember as MOASS approaches and MSM coverage becomes inevitable and more widespread.
