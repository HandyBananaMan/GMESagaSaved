# Title: Why the new CT plan is GG's 6D chess play to completely eradicate dark pools and why 15% market share is way more than it sounds like.

The new post about the CT plan requiring 15% market share on lit exchanges seems to be confusing a couple of apes on here. I am referring to Charlie's video and relevant post here:

What Charlie is saying and what the filing is saying in the CT plan is **NOT** **that 15% of all volume has to go through lit exchanges to have voting rights on market affairs**.

The filing is saying that if you want to have voting rights (**hint: you absolutely do or else competing exchanges can totally screw you during voting**) you must have on your lit exchanges 15% of total market share (volume).

This is in direct competition with competing exchanges' 15% market share. This means that under these new rules, **there will not be enough market share to go around** to reach the 15% magic number for all exchanges.

Therefore, exchanges are going to have a panicked frenzy to achieve as much market share (volume) as they can at the expense of dark pool volume, which is specifically noted as excluded from this 15%.

This is an absolute masterstroke by the SEC by using the greed of wall street against itself as exchanges **will now compete for as much market share as they can** **get to take away from other exchanges' 15% so they can vote in favor of their own exchanges at the expense of others.**

**TLDR:** The 15% market share rule is not for the total stock market but for each individual exchange. Under these new rules, there will not be enough market share to go around for every exchange to have voting rights. Therefore exchanges will compete for as much market share for less voters at the table, letting wall street greed itself be the death of dark pools.
