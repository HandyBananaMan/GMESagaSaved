Hey everyone! Ready for maybe a case of the Mondays today?

I'm the guy who flipped off the building we like seeing lights! If you're wondering which one I was, I'm the one with the double-jointed fingers that makes everything I do with my hands look incredibly awkward and uncomfortable.

^That is a link to the post I will be talking about here!

Yeah, so the party with the guys from the FBI was actually very interesting, I believe. I will start by saying that I do not intend on revealing any names or personal information about who I met with.

Before I got several beers into the party, I asked him about what he does and if he can even share that info with people. As expected, he told me that he can't say any specifics, but he tells people to ask away and he will share whatever actually can be discussed with civilians. Fair enough!

So, I told him about how I have a tip that Citadel Securities, Point 72, and Susquehanna are involved in illegal naked shorting (counterfeit shares), willingly reporting false information to public filings by using offshore accounts and shell companies, and using domestic ones and each other along with possibly big banks to play a sort of hot potato to avoid closing positions that should have been closed at earlier dates. I told him how this may all tie in with their investigation into Robinhood securities' actions in January during the runup with GameStop and how it may be Citadel, P72, and Sus's bad bet with GameStop that is causing them to get involved with these illegal activities.

I then finished by telling him that rising inflation, collapsing treasury bonds, and rising RRP are signals that a market collapse may be coming soon, and that although I personally believe that it is inevitable to happen, that me and a few friends would like to make sure that public information that may or may not be accessible today or hard to find was in the hands of investigators so that the bad actors can go to jail and be suspended from using the market. This would be unlike in 2008 where only one person went to jail for counting cards at the casino.

He was definitely interested in what I had to say! As I started talking, he turned in his seat and leaned forward a bit, and he always held eye contact with me. When another guy at the party was asking me about GameStop, and I was explaining marrying options and fundamentals, I saw him in the corner of my eye turning to me to listen to what I was saying.

He told me that he could give me his contact information and I could share the information with him. He said that he understood a bit of what I had to say only cause he isn't big on finances or the market, but he knows people who do, and that by sending him the info rather than submitting it via the FBI site, eyes will get to it faster than waiting in line, having HQ route it, etc. *Additionally, he said that since he works in Chicago, the team he works with will be right there to access information on Citadel since that's where they work!*

So I out this as possible DD because this is what I want to do:

- Compile a document of DD, specifically ones that use publicly accessable information to draw its conclusions, and focuses on pointing out *leads into how Citadel, Point 72, Susquehanna, and other companies are being bad actors and violating market rules*
- To accomplish the above, I would like to edit the document to make it more professionally presentable, removing mentioning of tits, apes, get fuk'd, etc. I love this community and all the memes and shit posts and hype talk, but I think the information will be taken more seriously this way.
- In order to compile all this information, I would like to have some wrinkles helping me in deciding what should go in and what can be left out as being too speculative or not focused on pointing out bad actors in our market. I was hoping that peeps like Criand or Atobit could help me here.

u/criand
u/atobitt

The goal of all of this is not to have the FBI shut shit down and start the MOASS. *The goal is to make sure that the FBI has leads and tips and information already on hand so they can investigate before shit goes tits up.* I want them to have leads to get information that could put some of these assholes behind bars. I want them to be able to work with the SEC is possible or necessary.

I had a blast at the party yesterday, I'm excited for market open, and I'm hoping maybe I did my part for the community by getting some info that could help fix this "free and fair" market.
