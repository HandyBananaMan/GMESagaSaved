    "selftext": "Citadel is registering hundreds of shell stock companies and trade them on NYSE and NASDAQ, each has similar $200M market cap, $10 share price, ownership structure, Cayman HQ, daily volume, and name is like tool-generated. This is speeding up in 2021.\n\nOk so I had some fun with this cool full text search tool by SEC\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar](https://www.sec.gov/edgar)\n\n<<EDIT: it appears there is a lot more digging to do before drawing any conclusions, so I encourage every ape to use that SEC tool and dig deeper>>\n\nIt allows to scan all the filings for a certain phrase. I was doing some other searches but typed Citadel out of curiosity. So after a few searches I noticed that there are hundreds of filings of this type:\n\nSC 13G (Beneficial ownership report)\n\nfor companies with similar names like Thimble Point Acquisition Corp, XXX XXX Acquisition Corp. and so on.\n\nHere's a sample filing [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001423053/000110465921066881/tm2116471d2\\_sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001423053/000110465921066881/tm2116471d2_sc13g.htm)\n\nit discloses ownership structure which consists of Citadel Advisors, C Securities, other Citadels, Ken and some weird CALC IV LP. All of those which I opened are very similar, differ in number of shares, but the pattern is obvious. There are roughly 200 such filings between 1st March 2021 and today:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=%2522Citadel%2520Advisors%2520LLC%2522&dateRange=custom&startdt=2021-03-01&enddt=2021-08-09&page=2](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=%2522Citadel%2520Advisors%2520LLC%2522&dateRange=custom&startdt=2021-03-01&enddt=2021-08-09&page=2)\n\nand since Jan 2020 it's around 400.\n\nscreenshot:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ave5gliwn9g71.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=18be6d4b7283624790f309ce69e7a470cdb51733\n\nbut each of these companies has a ticker and is traded on NYSE or NASDAQ. Why? This is so obvious that they don't do anything (EDIT: they do, search for the filings of some of those companies, they own shares in various other companies), why would someone want to trade their stocks? Daily volume is around 10k shares. Let's get tickers from the screenshot above: FWAC, RKTA, LCAA.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkta](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkta)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fwac](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fwac)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lcaa](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/lcaa)\n\nThis is absurd. In 2021 one can bot create 200 companies with 200M market cap and put them onto some biggest most prestigious stock exchanges?\n\nCan some more wrinkled ape help here? Why they are doing this?\n\nI read some DD back in Spring about registering shitload of SPACs to transfer funds on Cayman Islands, but why they are traded on stock market now?\n\nEDIT: i very roughly dug into reports filed to SEC which contain some of those names and they collectively own shares in other stock companies. It looks like an incredible opaque web of ownership structure. Some of other companies could probably have much less owners if we group Citadel-owned entitites into one. Digging deeper..\n\nOk so I refined the list from 2021, it's 78, I removed the duplicates and updated link below. Some can be falsely related to Citadel despite having Citadel Advisors in ownership filing, so always verify and double check.\n\n[https://pastebin.com/EdCNDbmR](https://pastebin.com/EdCNDbmR)\n\nWith this list we can see how many of them intersect in ownership structure of other companies. I will do this, maybe today and post my research.\n\nCredit : U/wladeczeck4\n\nEdit : Grammar",
