<p>Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, Gurbir S. Grewal, hasn't been at the SEC long, and he's already making statements showing his support for retail investors. </p>
<p>This Grewal quote from the recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-148">SEC press release</a> regarding "charging 9 individuals for...fraud schemes that generated hundreds of millions of 💵 from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors" (sound familiar?) as the SEC put it <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1424812880424275970?s=20">on Twitter</a> gave me hope:</p>
<p>“The SEC is committed to rooting out fraudulent attacks on our financial markets by bad actors in the United States and around the world...Those who scheme to defraud retail investors...should know that they cannot hide behind sophisticated structures or international borders.”</p>
<p>WOW. That's big. </p>
<p>And it's directly relevant to our situation. This tells me that the SEC is on our side, and, although the wheels of progress sometimes turn slowly, they are doing REAL WORK ON OUR BEHALF behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I realize I can't prove any of this, which makes it speculative and potentially wrong, but it gives be hope nonetheless.</p>
<p>Love you all, and see you in the ♾️ pool.</p>
