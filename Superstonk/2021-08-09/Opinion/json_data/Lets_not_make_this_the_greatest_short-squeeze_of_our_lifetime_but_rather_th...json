    "selftext": "Short squeezes only exist because of the predatory and **illegal** market manipulation practiced every day on Wall Street.  GME will not only benefit from calling this practice out and standing against it, but also has the potential to demolish it as a practice entirely.\n\nAll we need to do is frame our intent as less about our wallets and more about meaningful, impactful change for our economic ethics, and by way of that, meaningful and impactful change for the world.\n\nEverything is connected.  Let me say that again \u2014 **Everything is connected.** \nThis is so much bigger than me, than you, than GameStop, than the stupid *stock market.*  This is about people becoming enlightened to the fact that we aren\u2019t a society divided into the haves and have nots, the white, the black, the young and old.  We are one collective *global* people, and we have believed the lie that we aren\u2019t for far, far too long.\n\nWe can fix our economic system from a moral and ethical standpoint as long as we march upon this crusade with that set as the intent in our hearts.  And boys, I think we are going to do just that.\n\nLove you all.  Buy and hold.  Do something good with it. \ud83e\udde1",
