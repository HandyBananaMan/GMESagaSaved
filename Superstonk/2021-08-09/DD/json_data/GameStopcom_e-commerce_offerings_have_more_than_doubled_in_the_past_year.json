    "selftext": "This will be a quick one. I have limited access to some [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) historical data regarding the number of products they offer on their website. I was able to piece together some data over time to get an idea of their growth as an e-commerce company over the past year. I'll go ahead and put the important part here at the start:\n\n**From July 2020 to July 2021, GameStop's online catalog increased from around 35,000 products to 75,000 products. The large gains came primarily from the following categories: Pre-owned Games & Accessories, Digital Games & Subscriptions and Gaming Electronics & PC Components.**\n\nHere is a graph. Note the data has some gaps. The data feeds I have access to only updated about once a month, which is why there are large jumps. In reality GameStop was adding products regularly throughout each month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzcyq5qjtcg71.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=7796ab5c74470571a2bc46d5a4a304d1cf60dfe2\n\nHere is a breakdown by category:\n\n**New Consoles, Electronics & PC Accessories**\n\nJuly 22, 2020: 423August 2, 2021: 3445\n\n(Large increase in electronics & PC accessories.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gen 9 Consoles & Accessories**\n\nJuly 7, 2020: 66July 28, 2021: 84\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nintendo Switch & Accessories**\n\nAugust 15, 2020: 9May 26, 2021: 66\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gift Cards & Digital Products**\n\nJanuary 20, 2021: 10June 1, 2021: 125\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Digital Games & Subscriptions**\n\nJuly 22, 2020: 4167June 14, 2021: 7119\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New Games**\n\nJuly 7, 2020: 7089August 8, 2021: 7368\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Preowned Games, Accessories & Collectibles**\n\nJuly 22, 2020: 25206August 02, 2021: 55954\n\n(Main increase being collectibles)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTA;DR:\ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Buy, Hodl & Shop.\n\nEDIT: 6 hours after posting this, GameStop added another 306 products.",
