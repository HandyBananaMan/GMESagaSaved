<p>This will be a quick one. I have limited access to some <a href="https://GameStop.com">GameStop.com</a> historical data regarding the number of products they offer on their website. I was able to piece together some data over time to get an idea of their growth as an e-commerce company over the past year. I'll go ahead and put the important part here at the start:</p>
<p><strong>From July 2020 to July 2021, GameStop's online catalog increased from around 35,000 products to 75,000 products. The large gains came primarily from the following categories: Pre-owned Games &amp; Accessories, Digital Games &amp; Subscriptions and Gaming Electronics &amp; PC Components.</strong></p>
<p>Here is a graph. Note the data has some gaps. The data feeds I have access to only updated about once a month, which is why there are large jumps. In reality GameStop was adding products regularly throughout each month.</p>
