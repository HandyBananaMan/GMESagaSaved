I say if because we haven’t had an “official” announcement of the NFT, just lots of things that point to it. 

But if this works like we are hoping it does, all of the sudden Gamestop becomes almost like an insurance provider against naked short selling on Wall Street. Overnight they would go from selling video games to selling protection for your multi-billion dollar company.

Idk this may have been discussed already and I’ve missed it, but it’s what I keep trying to tell me friends. Gamestop is so much more than video games and entertainment.

So how easily could this actually take place? Could Gamestop start selling its blockchain tech?

Edit: damn autocorrect changed naked to baked in my title 🤦🏻‍♂️
