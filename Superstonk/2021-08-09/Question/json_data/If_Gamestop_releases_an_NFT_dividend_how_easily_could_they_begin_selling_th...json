Overnight they would go from selling video games to selling protection for your multi-billion dollar company.\n\nIdk this may have been discussed already and I\u2019ve missed it, but it\u2019s what I keep trying to tell me friends. Gamestop is so much more than video games and entertainment.\n\nSo how easily could this actually take place? Could Gamestop start selling its blockchain tech?\n\nEdit: damn autocorrect changed naked to baked in my title \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
