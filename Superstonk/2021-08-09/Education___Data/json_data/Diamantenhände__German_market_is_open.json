    "selftext": "Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to thank u/thecactusblender for handling the updates for last Thursday and Friday - they did a great job and I really appreciate them keeping this series running smoothly!\n\nThis is another moment when there is a certain energy in the GME communities that makes me feel like there is something big about to happen, though obviously the short hedge funds have continued to short the stock, manipulate the price through dark pools, and spread FUD to try to prevent it. The DD continues to grow, Apes continue to HODL, and our collective Diamantenh\u00e4nde are up to the challenge. Apes own the float, the short positions must be closed, and the MOASS is inevitable.\n\nToday is Monday, August 9th, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 120 minutes in: **$154.02 / 130,94 \u20ac**  *(volume: 1201)*\r\n- \u2b1c 115 minutes in: $154.11 / 131,01 \u20ac  *(volume: 1176)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 110 minutes in: $154.11 / 131,01 \u20ac  *(volume: 1085)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 105 minutes in: $154.02 / 130,94 \u20ac  *(volume: 1078)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 100 minutes in: $154.05 / 130,96 \u20ac  *(volume: 1031)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 95 minutes in: $154.06 / 130,98 \u20ac  *(volume: 1024)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 90 minutes in: $154.06 / 130,97 \u20ac  *(volume: 1001)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 85 minutes in: $154.03 / 130,95 \u20ac  *(volume: 922)*\r\n- \u2b1c 80 minutes in: $154.05 / 130,96 \u20ac  *(volume: 850)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 75 minutes in: $154.05 / 130,96 \u20ac  *(volume: 786)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 70 minutes in: $154.08 / 130,99 \u20ac  *(volume: 778)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 65 minutes in: $154.21 / 131,10 \u20ac  *(volume: 763)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 60 minutes in: $152.40 / 129,56 \u20ac  *(volume: 549)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 55 minutes in: $152.33 / 129,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 405)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 50 minutes in: $152.30 / 129,48 \u20ac  *(volume: 378)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 45 minutes in: $152.27 / 129,45 \u20ac  *(volume: 321)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 40 minutes in: $152.28 / 129,46 \u20ac  *(volume: 194)*\r\n- \u2b1c 35 minutes in: $152.06 / 129,27 \u20ac  *(volume: 172)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 30 minutes in: $152.06 / 129,27 \u20ac  *(volume: 157)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 25 minutes in: $152.03 / 129,25 \u20ac  *(volume: 156)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 20 minutes in: $152.00 / 129,23 \u20ac  *(volume: 153)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 15 minutes in: $152.02 / 129,24 \u20ac  *(volume: 153)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 10 minutes in: $152.15 / 129,35 \u20ac  *(volume: 138)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 5 minutes in: $152.18 / 129,38 \u20ac  *(volume: 121)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $152.12 / 129,32 \u20ac  *(volume: 0)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 US close price: $151.77 / 129,03 \u20ac   *($152.36 / 129,53 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD.
