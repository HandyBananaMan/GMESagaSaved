Zero speculation on why/what it means, but it's the first movement from these addresses since July 16.\n\n\nEdit before someone asks: 0x381 is \"confirmed\" to be [Matt Finestone](https://twitter.com/finestonematt/) via a link on his twitter from what I believe was an NFT he won that listed his address, as well as the fact that when you [look at his address on opensea or etherscan](https://opensea.io/0x381636D0E4eD0fa6aCF07D8fd821909Fb63c0d10) you can see he owns the finestone.eth ENS registration.",
