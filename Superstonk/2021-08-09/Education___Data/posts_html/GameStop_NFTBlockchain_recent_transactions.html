<p>Just a heads up that there have been some transactions involving the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x10b16eede03cf73cbf44e4bfffa3e6bff36f1fad">Gnosis Safe/Proxy 0x10b</a> that owns the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e">GameStop NFT contract</a> in the last 12 hours. </p>

<p>Last night <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x381636d0e4ed0fa6acf07d8fd821909fb63c0d10">Matt Finestone</a> sent <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3e05fcf31fbe997cdbe154d36029cede7f41bf26f54f0f4006ce7a9d8d88b8cc">0.03 Eth</a> to the "primary/most active" owner address of the Gnosis Safe, <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x61a80d1792340c2a03e739202980e69467459a8b">0x61a.</a></p>
<p>0x61a then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ac58a594a7a9d38acc17b12104d5ce6b11d62247551a69fcc94ed983bd7d7dd#eventlog">updated the Gnosis/Proxy contract 0x10b</a> to remove <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x850aa0b86b8aa76b95cef283bcb2e7c008c7202b">0x850aa0b86b8aa76b95cef283bcb2e7c008c7202b</a> as an owner, and add <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf89f1430faed758435c3ca457a0ff9014ce6015">0xaf89f1430faed758435c3ca457a0ff9014ce6015</a> as an owner.</p>
<p>There is no transaction history for the new owner 0xaf, and the only <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x75d86673e6763e60d6e4c0e4b8577c861fb9b9b0e89563890cd276883f169ca3#eventlog">transaction 0x850</a> ever performed was to transfer ownership of the ENS registration/token for GME.eth to the Gnosis Safe.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x712567c13e74352fbf3f5931245ef6eff049640f391eb55b99a021bd3bd5297f">Event</a> changing the Gnosis Safe contract was on July 16, when the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbd2689745f4f0ed110959f743886fcc1560342e">address that created the Gnosis Safe</a> was removed as an owner.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL/WTF/DR:</strong> Small happenings with the contract that owns the GameStop NFT contract: an owner was removed and a new one added. Zero speculation on why/what it means, but it's the first movement from these addresses since July 16.</p>
<p>Edit before someone asks: 0x381 is "confirmed" to be <a href="https://twitter.com/finestonematt/">Matt Finestone</a> via a link on his twitter from what I believe was an NFT he won that listed his address, as well as the fact that when you <a href="https://opensea.io/0x381636D0E4eD0fa6aCF07D8fd821909Fb63c0d10">look at his address on opensea or etherscan</a> you can see he owns the finestone.eth ENS registration.</p>
