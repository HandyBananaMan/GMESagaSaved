Fellow Apes,

We all know about the statement of Gamestop on their Form 10K ([https://news.gamestop.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001326380-21-000032](https://news.gamestop.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001326380-21-000032)) published at the earnings call. However, there was always a reasonable doubt due to the fact, that the form was referring to the state of Jan 31st.

In the same 10K linked above, they already mentioned the ATM offering. They finalized it and announced it officially today with a Form 424B5 ([https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/424b5/0001193125-21-105564](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/424b5/0001193125-21-105564)).

So, the sell-off due to today's announcement is absolutely staged as we have seen after the earnings call (thanks George for the dip, I bought).

**HOWEVER:** **IN TODAYS FORM 424B5 THEY CONFIRMED THE SQUEEZE IS STILL GOING ON:** 

&#x200B;

>A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our common stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our common stock. Investors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our common stock until additional shares of our common stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.” A large proportion of our common stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our common stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospectus and, once investors purchase the shares of our common stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our common stock may rapidly decline. Investors that purchase shares of our common stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.

&#x200B;

**AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY CONFIRM MEDIA COVERAGE IS BS:**

&#x200B;

>Information available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media may include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate. We have received, and may continue to receive, a high degree of media coverage that is published or otherwise disseminated by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media. This includes coverage that is not attributable to statements made by our directors, officers or employees. You should read carefully, evaluate and rely only on the information contained in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus or any applicable free writing prospectus filed with the SEC in determining whether to purchase our shares of common stock. Information provided by third parties may not be reliable or accurate and could materially impact the trading price of our common stock which could cause losses to your investments.

&#x200B;

**RC WILL INSTRUCT JEFFRIES WHEN TO ISSUE HOW MANY NEW SHARES:**

&#x200B;

>Each time we wish to issue and sell our shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement, we will notify Jefferies the number of shares to be issued, the dates on which such sales are anticipated to be made, any limitation on the number of shares to be sold in any one day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made. Once we have so instructed Jefferies, unless Jefferies declines to accept the terms of such notice, Jefferies has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices to sell such shares up to the amount specified on such terms. The obligations of Jefferies under the Sales Agreement to sell our shares of common stock are subject to a number of conditions that we must meet

&#x200B;

**THEY EXPLICITLY SAY THEY MAY NOT SELL THE TOTAL 3.5mm SHARES ANNOUNCED**

&#x200B;

> The actual number of shares we will issue under the Sales Agreement, at any one time or in total, is uncertain. Subject to certain limitations in the Sales Agreement and compliance with applicable law, we have the discretion to deliver instruction to Jefferies to sell shares of our common stock at any time throughout the term of the Sales Agreement. The number of shares that are sold through Jefferies after our instruction will fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the market price of our common stock during the sales period, the limits we set with Jefferies in any instruction to sell shares, and the demand for our common stock during the sales period. Because the price per share of each share sold will fluctuate during this offering, it is not currently possible to predict the number of shares that will be sold or the gross proceeds to be raised in connection with those sales. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Nothing new here, the sell-off is staged. Gamestop confirms Squeeze is on and media coverage is BS. RC will decide when and how many (if any) shares are given out. VERY BULLISH! 

**EDIT 1:** Added the statement in which they announce they may or may not use the sell offer entirely.
