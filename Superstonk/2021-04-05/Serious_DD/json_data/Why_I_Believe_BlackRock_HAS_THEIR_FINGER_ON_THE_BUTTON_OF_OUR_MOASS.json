    "selftext": "From previous DD, we've discovered\n\n1.) BlackRock has the most shares in both AMC/GME,  ([Marketbeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/institutional-ownership/))\n\n2.) [They have a strong relationship tie to Adam Aron](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/mjm39k/whos_in_bed_with_who_part_1_amc_ceo_adam_aron/), CEO of AMC\n\n3.) They hold their \"[highest level of cash in years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-03-29/blackrock-s-rieder-running-highest-level-of-cash-in-years-video)...\" \\[Please watch that video if you want to understand my BlackRock CIO references\\]\n\n\\*\\*4) [Ryan Cohen & Chewy received $350MIL in six rounds of funding](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale), one of which was BlackRock.\n\nNow I want to dispel a myth, Elon Musk has spoken out AGAINST BlackRock (/Vanguard). **I DO NOT believe they are friendly whales on GME**. Instead, I believe their CIO has a knack for playing both sides of the fence.\n\n[PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/elon-musk-says-on-twitter-blackrock-helps-short-sellers.html)...\n\nAt first, after reading it, I was disillusioned, but then I thought more on it...\n\nIf what the TechnoKing of Tesla alleges is true, odds are BlackRock has repeated this pattern with GME  (possibly AMC) and loaned our their $9+MILLION shares to short-sellers. Likely those short-sellers were hedge funds. And more than likely, when they sold those borrowed shares and **WE BOUGHT THEM**.\n\nNow let's back-up to the previous video of BlackRock's CIO mentioning the fallout of Billy Hwang's topple, how overleveraged (and illiquid) the market may be AND dropping that BlackRock is running their \"HIGHEST CASH POSITION IN YEARS... PERHAPS EVER.\"\n\nWell, if I knew there was a likely crashing of stocks, I'd also keep my cash reserves high for the looming fire-sale. BlackRock CIO also admits expecting more volatility in the market, but what he doesn't say is BlackRock may be in a position to create that volatility by calling back their shares from short-sellers.\n\nRemember GME has a *negative beta of 13 to 33* \\[depending on which metric for beta you use\\].\n\nWhen they recall those shares, given my assumption that they'll continue their *both-sides-of-the-fence* trading strategy, the borrowers HAVE TO REPURCHASE THEM IN THE MARKET...\n\n# And that, dear apes = MOASS\n\nNow, 'tists, please help me with this; if you are a hedge fund that loans out your shares, is there a timetable for when your shares are due back to you?\n\nCan you loan them out and collect interest everyday until they're repaid, i-e you're getting paid no matter?\n\nCan you sell shares you've loaned out as the squeeze is happening even though those shares HAVE YET TO BE RETURNED? I-e do you miss the potential high $$ sale-point per share during the squeeze?\n\nTherefore, I'll inject my fancy-shmancy new term ***Latent Buying Pressure***, which only increases (*latent boner pressure* works too) how BlackRock-to-shortsellers-to-retail-to-BlackRock share recall-to-shortseller repurchase mania = MOASS.\n\nSimply put, if this is true, it's another explosive element to add to this powder-fucking-keg of a stock.\n\n*PLEASE CORRECT ANY ISSUES IN THIS LOGIC. I've been stewing over this for a week or so now and I Just want to understand it correctly.*\n\nADDENDUM\n\nAnother post that thickens the plot of what I allege above (specifically the battle between two hedge funds, **SIG & Citadel** versus **BlackRock &Vanguard**, how Tesla is another battlefield betwixt the two can be found here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md89wg/king\\_kong\\_magnum\\_opus\\_dd\\_posted\\_on\\_behalf\\_of\\_wuz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md89wg/king_kong_magnum_opus_dd_posted_on_behalf_of_wuz/)\n\nADDENDUM II\n\nRead this excellent breakdown of our current market mechanics, the shorts, naked shorts, how the ETF (Eee Tee Eff) market has serious exposure potential, the Bank of Japan as a test case for what we won't be doing.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml1er1/a\\_gme\\_saga\\_the\\_two\\_towers/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml1er1/a_gme_saga_the_two_towers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",
