<p>Hi! I use revolut and was able to set a 1mil sales limit. I contacted support and they said for sell there shouldn't be a limit. It seems the limit is for purchasing
The only drawback seems to be that it expires daily -u/Ampedrosa</p>
<p>Hello fellow ape, I saw your post on the exit strategy and I really fucking love you. I'm a UK based ape on Revolut, I had a whole convo with them yesterday about how they will act during the squeeze. I pressed on more details about "high risk" situations in which they would liquidate us early, but basically they told me even Revolut doesn't know what "high risk" means for the broker Drivewealth... One more important thing they told me, that you might want to add to the post, is about the limit on selling, I asked them if we can go above 10k: "If you sell exactly the amount of shares you own, the trade will go through even if the number of shares/total amount in USD is higher or lower than the limit. You can do that through tapping on the "Max" button (which is above the keyboard) when submitting the order. Your Order might not be accepted if it gives rise to too much risk for the Third Party Broker or if trading is no longer available or is suspended in the Instrument your Order relates to." Can't send screenshots in here but as soon as I figure it out, I can send you the conversation. Thank you for your awesome work !! [user name censored on /rGME]</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m8nk84/important_all_apes_need_to_read_this_to_prepare/ Hello! Im a Revolut user and i contacted them, as we know we can't sell above 10.000 $ per share BUT they told me this: NOTE: Only if you sell as "market order". "As we have checked here, if you sell exactly the amount of shares you own, the trade will go through even if the number if shares/total amount in USD is higher or lower than the limit. You can do this through tapping in the 'Max' button (which is above the keyboard) when submiting the order" -u/xZetroX</p>
<p>Hey ! I saw your great post about limit sell for each broker. Really good job ! I did some research on Revolut and some fellow apes gave a solution to do limit sell at any price point. (1M+ validated, i can do screenshot) You just have to have a round number of share and put a limit sell for all your share at once. On the other hand, we weren't able to verify if we can do this with more than 500 shares (we don't have that much unfortunately) -u/caribouteille</p>
<p><strong>2. Wealthsimple</strong></p>
<p>Wealthsimple currently restricts max transaction to 1 Million - u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kennywise91">Kennywise91</a>you can login to wealthsimple.com and set orders over 1 mill CAD. the limit sell option still wont let u set a price of 1 mill if the current price is too low but you can set a price over 1 mill CAD, unlike on the app. so when it moons, have a get the fuck home strategy if u work. -u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xthemoonx">xthemoonx</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôm with wealthsimple and currently the limit sell doesn‚Äôt surpass $999,999 USD but only up to $800,000 is supported since apparently orders cannot be above 1 million CAD. Others told me that market sells should be fine but now I‚Äôm a little worried about that. I do no intend on selling on the way up at all however I‚Äôm worried about missing out on some sweet tendies. What about market sells are so bad? What could potential happen to them? Also it appears that transferring over to quest trade now would be dangerous as I might miss the squeeze. If anyone can give me some input on this I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I‚Äôm sure a lot of Canadian apes are on wealthsimple so I hope we don‚Äôt all get fucked -u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KieranSullivan5">KieranSullivan5</a></p>

<p>Ally has a limit of $1M. I guess that means one sell order per share then.  -  u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blueskin">blueskin</a></p>
<p><strong>4. Fidelity</strong></p>
<p>fidelity will not restrict selling prices as long as the exchange doesnt i called and they only follow in the exchanges path - u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Top10Tops">Top10Tops</a></p>
<p>To Fidelity folks, Just spoke to customer service and they said there's no sell limit as to how high a stock goes.</p>
<p>Here's the convo, note* I haven't mentioned amc or gme and this was his response.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: How can I help you today?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Hi John, I was wondering if there's a sell limit for Fidelity?</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: For example, if a stock climbs to astronomical numbers is there a limit to how much I'd be able to sell it for?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Great question!</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: No, there is no upper limit to what you can sell a stock for<strong>John</strong>: If you bought a stock for $1 and the value went to $1 million, you could sell for the profit</p>
<p>-u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snowbell-">Snowbell-</a></p>
<p>AFAIK Fidelity won‚Äôt let you set a limit sell order for 50% or more above the current price. Assuming that‚Äôs the only rule then it just means you‚Äôll need to watch the price for when it‚Äôs approaching 700k to put a limit sell order at 1 milly -u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/meekdor/">meekdor</a></p>
<p><strong>5. E*Trade</strong></p>
<p>I called E*Trade to ask if there‚Äôs a limit on my account. THEY SAID NO! 3,000,000 is the floor apes!! - u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AWet1017">AWet1017</a></p>
<p>I'll ask this here since my topic didn't get much traction:</p>
<p>Anyone using E-Trade? I have a question. I sent them a message asking to ensure they wouldn't freeze up my account should a short squeeze occur that would keep me from buying or selling, similar to Robin Hood (I heard E-Trade was involved in some of those shenanigans too). Anyway, they just gave me a generic bot response and didn't answer my question, surprise, surprise.</p>
<p>I'm on a cash-only account, but what would keep them from not allowing me to sell my shares during the MOASS? Thanks for any help you apes can give. -u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mega_Buster_">Mega_Buster_</a></p>
<p>I called e-trade this morning and they confirmed that there aren't limits to transactions. They said if I make a sell limit order of 30 shares and I have a buyer of &amp; 1mil/share and it's during market hours that they won't limit that transaction -u/Dr_Scuba_Steve</p>
<p><strong>6. Freetrade</strong></p>
<p>Okay, I am extremely smooth brained and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm understanding this right. Can someone eli5:I use Freetrade (UK ape) and asked if I can sell single shares worth $1M+.Their response: you need to ensure US trades are within ¬£25k limit. You need to break down your order into multiple orders within the limit.Are they saying I have to break down 1 milly into 30 separate orders? Or have I just eaten too many crayons to function üòÇüñçüñçüñç - u/ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/0To100RealFckngQuick">0To100RealFckngQuick</a></p>
<p>FYI UK apes, freetrade has a limit of ¬£25k per sale, i have contacted their support and their response was that since none of the stocks they list are anywhere near that limit they see no reason to increase it. that means we are gonna be doing a shed load of transactions come the squeeze - u/ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-remlap">-remlap</a></p>
<p><strong>7. SoFi</strong></p>
<p>For those using SoFi, I just called them and asked about transaction limits, there is no limit as to how high a share can go when trying to sell it. It can go to over a million a share and you should have no problem selling it.  -u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nk_Raven">Nk_Raven</a></p>
<p><strong>8. Hargreaves Lansdown</strong></p>
<p>UK Ape. Hargreaves Lansdown doesn't allow Limit Sells on $GME.  -u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/misterpeers">misterpeers</a></p>
<p>Great post OP, thank you. UK Ape here. Anybody else use Hargreaves Lansdown? They only allow Market Orders for US stocks. Believe that's the only way I can sell. If another user can respond, I'd appreciate that very much please! Thanks! -u/ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VelvetThunderFinance">VelvetThunderFinance</a></p>
<p>Hargreaves Lansdown do not allow for limit orders on US stocks. Could you please request on your post that anyone who owns GME with HL, should contact them either by email or phone to request that they introduce limit orders on US stocks. I have spoken with them twice and both times they have said that limit orders could potentially be made available if there is enough demand. A large influx of calls making this request might make them speed up their intentions of making limit orders possible. Hopefully with enough demand they will allow them in time for the squeeze to bring some security to all the UK apes who are holding GME with HL. Their contact information is on their website. They usually pick up the phone quite quickly. A comment about this situation on your post would be most appreciated, strength in numbers after all. -u/Antbog1</p>
<p><strong>9. eToro</strong></p>
<p>You can‚Äôt place a Stop Limit Order on eToro üòî  - u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ReXJK">ReXJK</a>Hi, one smooth brainer here with a question. On Etoro it‚Äôs impossible to set a stop limit order, as there is no option like that. (Using Etoro EU) Also, I want to know if I can sell a milly/share, me no talk etoro people holidays free no answer faster answer here. ü¶ç Alsoüíéüëêand put some respect on our mutual success! -u/ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TreasureCase2020">TreasureCase2020</a></p>
<p>When you go to edit ‚ÄúEdit Trade‚Äù click on ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù then ‚ÄúSet SL‚Äù that is where Etoro lets you enter your price (you can chose between amount and rate). I tried entering the amount 1 000 000 and of course it didn‚Äôt work, the maximum it would let me enter was barely above the current. But right below the box when you enter the rate/amount, there is an option called ‚ÄúTrailing Stop Loss‚Äù. Read this article to understand its use: https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/etoro-updates/introducing-trailing-stop-loss/ Between ‚ÄúTrailing Stop Loss‚Äù and the box where you enter the amount/rate you will find the percentage according to the position amount/rate at that particular moment. If it doesn‚Äôt show, just click on ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚Äú-‚Äú . If you put a number that represents 90%, if at any moment during the squeeze the price drops 10% from the highest price it has been on all day, the position will get closed. For example, a certain trading day, the price reaches 1 000 000 (which here represents 100%) and I have ‚ÄúStop Loss" activated along with a ‚ÄúTrailing Lost‚Äù of 90%. If the price goes down to 900 000 (which is 90% of 1 000 000) the trade will be closed. So, even if eToro goes offline, that should ensure that the trade will close at the best price possible after the peak. I hope.</p>
<p>It might be a safe option to activate after the price gets to an amount one is comfortable with (for example 1 000 000) or when one feels that the peak has been reached. -u/Personal-Tourist-03</p>
<p>Hey man, I'd like to help you clarify about eToro and the sell limitations. The way to set a price to sell at is to click on the position, click on take profit, and then enter the value you want. It is the same as fidelity where it lets you go higher as the price goes up. You can set it to 1000% of the current price. e.g Price is now 300, I can set a take profit of 3000. Hope this helps -u/Dragonizer23</p>
<p><strong>10. Degiro</strong></p>
<p>I do have concerns about DeGiro. I tried to set a sell limit at a high price just to see how it would look, lol. But it told me it exceeded their maximum order size of ‚Ç¨250.000. Does anyone know more about this limitation? When GME squeezes I don‚Äôt want to be held back by this. What could we, holders at DeGiro, do about this? They do sell Berkshire Hathaway shares, so technically it should be possible to sell in the hundreds of thousands right?</p>
<p>Update: I asked the same question on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degiro">r/degiro</a> and there they said that if the share closes at above ‚Ç¨250k there should be no problems selling the shares at their actual price.üôåüíé-u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Always_Highdrated">Always_Highdrated</a></p>
<p>Degiro doesn't allow you to place a limit order sell 20% higher than the current price. Aside of that I am not aware if there is any other kind of limitation. Currently there is no stock or security in existence that is near the 250.000 that you suggest in your post, so it is normal that it didn't let you place the order. -u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Maximito">Maximito</a></p>
<p>just got off the phone with Degiro customer support, they said they would never restrict you from closing your position, not even at a million</p>
<p>This was however only one guy from customer support. Think we can trust that but you never know. wouldn't be the first time a customer support staff member made a mistake -u/Jobdriaan</p>
<p><strong>11. Robbinghood</strong></p>
<p>For anyone wondering Robinhood does not have have a cap on placing a limit sell. So for all you smooth brained apes out there, this means when Gmmee hits 2,000,000 a share, a limit sell order will be able to be placed for 2,000,000  - u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChimpGimpy">ChimpGimpy</a></p>
<p><strong>12. Questrade</strong></p>
<p>No limit on selling, but limit on setting sell limits (right now I can set $9999 but not higher).</p>
<p>EDIT: According to u/equinsuosha , if you change your route, you can set the limit price to whatever you want. I tested this with changing the route to MNGD it let me set a limit sell price of 42069.69, but I still have to get back with Questrade on how changing the routing affects the sale, if any. </p>

<p>Hello hello. Charles Schwab user here. There is an initial trade limit of 1000 shares or 20k (if any apes are considering transferring). There is no maximum amount for selling, but there's a cap on limit orders based on current prices. I can place one just under 4k.  u/itsdaynotdave</p>

<p><strong>16. Webull</strong></p>
<p>Rumor has it Webull currently allows a maximum limit sell order at 2000% (20x) current market value. So with GME's current $200 price you could set a limit sell order up to $4000. (I saw this info posted by a user in the GME comments section on Webull, who asked the company to clarify the policy after having very high limit sell orders unilaterally canceled by Webull.)  - u/Green8Dreamer</p>

<p>Hi nhne, I asked trading 212. So first Theres no Limit concerning how hight the price of a security sold can be. When I asked about sell limits they said it's dependent on the security and the market and stuff They said I should provide them with an order id
But I can't because I cant fill an order with that high of a sell limit
You might want to add that to your post. Selling possible at any price. Limit selling I don't know I tried a few prices but wasn't even allowed to do 5000 -/utilidus</p>

<p>Me: Okay, so I‚Äôll try to rephrase If a stock is currently selling at $1million/per share, TDA would not limit or restrict a shareholder from selling at that price?

<p>TDAmeritrade is lying. Their max sell price varies according to the current ask price, something like 225% X CURRENT ASK.</p>
<p>If you set the max, say $459 like I did on testing the upper limit on Friday AND you set this ax GTC... If ASK drops and your MAX SELL price drops below the then recalculated max price, TDA will cancel your order!</p>

<p>Hi, regarding your post in r/GME with the list of brokers, I have contacted Stake, one thats in a few countries outside the US, like the UK, Australia, and NZ among others. This was their response today:
As per how markets operate, share price itself does not affect a security‚Äôs ability to be bought or sold. For example, Berkshire Hathaway Class A ($BRK.A) trades at ~US$380,000 per share and people trade this freely and readily. However, there are some things to be aware of when placing certain order types at prices that are significantly different from where that security is currently trading. This FAQ provides more information. https://au.support.hellostake.com/en/support/solutions/articles/35000152385-order-types Finally, given your enquiry is about $GME, we urge you to please familiarise yourself with the risks associated with trading high volatility stocks. This blog may be helpful. https://hellostake.com/au/stake-updates/volatility-and-risk/</p>
<p>They have a Limit Sell Cap of 200% above the market value, but they only last for the day. If I put one in at $600 when the price is $200, it would stay even if the price dropped to $100, but would be cancelled at the end of the day regardless of price. -u/taraborn</p>
<p><strong>25. Traderepublic</strong></p>

<p><strong>27. Wells Fargo Advisors</strong></p>
<p>I just got off of the phone with Wells Fargo Advisors. They do not have a limit to how high you can sell a stock.</p>
<p>They did, however, stipulate that the current market price needs to be within +50% of any limit you put in place. So if the market price is 1 million, you'll need to wait a bit before you put a 2 mil or 3 mil sell limit per share. -u/Boleslaw-BoldHeart</p>

I also asked if there would be any restrictions if the stock price increased drastically and I would like to sell and in this case there are no restrictions either. As long as there is a buyer, the order will be executed. I do have to mention that XTB includes a 0,2% commission for orders over 100.000" -u/PowersBass</p>

<p>I asked if there was a maximum sell price (and put $1m as an example). The reply: Pavel P. (Trading 212) 29 Mar 2021, 15:29 EEST Greetings, u/YMabDaroganCont I hope you are well. I am happy to inform you that the client will be able to sell/buy any stock regardless of the current price unless a regulatory restriction is applied. // My response: Thanks for your prompt reply. I understand that trading halts can be put in place and I understand that this is out of your control, but could you give me an example of, or elaborate on, the kind of regulatory restrictions that could be put in place? I was very dissappointed late January during the $GME run up to ~$400 that I could not buy any shares, and since then I am very worried that during periods of high volatility that Trading212 will ‚Äúpull the rug‚Äù under my feet (again!). I also want to make it absolutely clear that even during times of high volatility that I will be able to sell my shares at the said price without them being stuck as ‚Äúpending‚Äù (again, as was seen during late January). // Response: Please bear in mind that whilst most of the orders are filled within a few seconds, please note that when it comes to Equities and ETFs (on Trading 212 Invest and ISA accounts), the execution time completely depends on every market and it may even take a few days for some orders to be executed (e.g. AIM listed stocks‚Äã)‚Äã. In other words, certain market conditions (i.e. liquidity) have to be met to have the orders executed. -u/YMabDaroganCont</p>
<p><strong>31. Nordnet</strong> (Finnish)</p>
<p>Hi! Addition to your broker sell limit compilation: Nordnet users can set sell-orders only within +/- 3% margin of current stock price (stock price &gt;50 USD). With stop-loss command, you can set any sell price (no matter if stock is going up or down). Im not sure is it possible to add stop-loss order to you existing positions or do you need to decide stop-loss price upon purchase. Also, using mobile app you can only sell/buu stock only for 999,999.00 USD. In desktop, there is no limitation. Thank you! :) =u/TaP3D</p>
