Guys, this is pure dynamite üß® A post on LinkedIn by Peter Hann, the investment manager of the city of Calgary officially sharing in detail all the fckery by Shitadel and friends he is seeing. 

It‚Äôs obviously very helpful if not only simple minded apes and belittled retail investors share their frustration but if also professional traders like him tell the public what is going on here (although he is unfortunately a paper hand and not a üíé handed ape it is a brave move to call them out in his position)

While the post is about the movie stock the manipulation methods obviously apply 1:1 to GME and are fully in line with our DD but if a guy like him makes it public at LinkedIn it will certainly draw some attention . Let‚Äôs see how long it will be allowed to be online...üí•üí™

‚ÄúShort's managed to get #Moviestock off the NYSE Threshold list last Friday, not clear exactly how this was done but looks like exposure converted from Fails to Deliver (#FTD) to outright naked shorts and then packaged into the #IWM ETF. 

I'm really not going to waste more brain power on this. Citadel is a market marker and between them and their "friend" #Virtu control 80% of retail orders. They can more or less dictate price on slow volume days. 

Allegations of buy orders being delayed as much as 35 days through Citadels data flow. How likely is that? Hard to verify baring an audit, but it is true that dark pool trading accounted for over 65% of volume for the last 5 trading days and over 50% over the last month.

Meanwhile, retail orders continue to be overwhelmingly buy oriented. The only selling is coming from shorts using the dark pools to mute buying pressure. The short-ladder attacks from last week seem to shifted to a numb inducing slow drip lower. 

The degree of overt manipulation is mind blowing. 

I am told #Citadel employs a team of psych Phd's to design price moves designed to drive retail interest away. The media attacks are clearly not working so the recent price campaign has escalated, driving it from $59 to $39 last week, a brief surge back to $49 and today's slow drip from $46.50 to $42.50 at the close. 

I really think Citadel needs to fire their pysch experts. Most retail is holding and bought large amounts in March. Many likely did sell a small amount in June like I did, to cover their initial investment. For example, I was long at $9.60 and sold at $53.40, enough to cover my buy in and show a decent realized gain. 

My remaining position is a free rider. The price could go down to $12 and many holders would still be in the money. There were 3.2 million retail holders in March, there are likely 5 million now, there has been no dilution so how are new buyers finding shares without the price rising considerably?

The longer Citadel delays this, the more the final bill will grow. The #DTCC has put most of their amendments into effect, so one wonders just how much free reign the #SEC will give Citadel and the 22 other shorts before strongly worded suggestions become more forcibly made directions. I thought in March the situation was a danger to financial stability. 

At this point I give up worrying about it as it appears officials in Washington have no clue the damage being done. If nothing else, the failure of officials to reign in Citadel all the while the stock is under a huge media spotlight will undermine confidence in the fairness of the market for retail participants. Which in turn will reduce retail activity and hurt longer term profitability for Citadel. 

So stop with the games and get on with popping the cyst.‚Äù
        
Unfortunately I can‚Äôt even post the official link here as it contains the name of the movie stock company but I posted it also on Etoro and include the ETORO link here which will take you to the original LinkedIn post....üôà: https://etoro.tw/3hz0MDe
