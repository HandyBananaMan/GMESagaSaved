See specifically this paragraph:\n\n[Paragraph from SR-DTC-2021-013](https://preview.redd.it/v8qhc4am41b71.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ccc33178058bb71e93945355bdee2db9c79d33)\n\nEdit 2: It looks like the NSCC has now proposed the same rule as SR-NSCC-2021-008. You can check it out here: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm)\n\nEdit 3: The FICC has also proposed the same rule located here: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/ficc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/ficc.htm)\n\nFunny Edit: The bot I have running that watches for changes to the SEC rules webpages caught them forgetting which quarter we are in (They were probably more focused on PornHub than their own website). This change to the NSCC rules page happened after the new rule was posted today. Note that NSCC-2021-007 had been posted since July 7th, yet was labeled as Q2 until today after the rule today was also posted under Q2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Red highlights are what showed before the update and green shows the update](https://preview.redd.it/bdvu8hwq02b71.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce1d17e5fb97020be157a30eaf0b85ed17d214ea)",
