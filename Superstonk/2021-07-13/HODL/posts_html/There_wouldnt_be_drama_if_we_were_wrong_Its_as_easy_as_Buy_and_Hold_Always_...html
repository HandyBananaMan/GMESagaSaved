<p>Never have I ever seen drama follow through 3 subs like this. That speaks volumes on the magnitude of fucked that these hedgies are. </p>
<p>Even for the people that don’t understand the DD, witnessing this persistent drama is enough to reveal there’s a lot of fuckery going on and that a lot of people are pissed that retail is about to get rich off GME exploding. </p>
<p>Buy and hold. Nothing has changed. </p>
<p>And remember, trust nobody except Ryan Cohen and DFV. Not even the mods. Their job is to be transparent with the community yet none of them want to share screenshots and would rather have this shadow government where they discuss things behind the scenes instead of providing that transparency. </p>
<p>Buy and hold. They’re trying to wear people out with the constant soap opera drama and they’re dumb as hell if they think it will work. </p>
<p>Been in GME since December and I’ve seen it all. They’re so fucked. Real ones know. </p>
<p>See you all in Valhalla. It’s going to be fucking glorious.</p>
