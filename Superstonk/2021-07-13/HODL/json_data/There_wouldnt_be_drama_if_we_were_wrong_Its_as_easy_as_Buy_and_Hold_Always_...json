    "selftext": "Never have I ever seen drama follow through 3 subs like this. That speaks volumes on the magnitude of fucked that these hedgies are. \n\n\nEven for the people that don\u2019t understand the DD, witnessing this persistent drama is enough to reveal there\u2019s a lot of fuckery going on and that a lot of people are pissed that retail is about to get rich off GME exploding. \n\nBuy and hold. Nothing has changed. \n\nAnd remember, trust nobody except Ryan Cohen and DFV. Not even the mods. Their job is to be transparent with the community yet none of them want to share screenshots and would rather have this shadow government where they discuss things behind the scenes instead of providing that transparency. \n\nBuy and hold. They\u2019re trying to wear people out with the constant soap opera drama and they\u2019re dumb as hell if they think it will work. \n\nBeen in GME since December and I\u2019ve seen it all. They\u2019re so fucked. Real ones know. \n\nSee you all in Valhalla. It\u2019s going to be fucking glorious.",
