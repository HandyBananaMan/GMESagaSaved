The system has been tainted.\n\n\u201dThe Centre Does Not Hold\u201d\n\nNone of that matters. The math and science of the situation lead to only one possible action: BUY and HODL.\n\nTo paraphrase some lines from Firefly:\n\n\u201cWe buy. We hold. That makes us righteous, and we are so very pretty.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffd",
