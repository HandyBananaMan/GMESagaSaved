<p>Alright. So my last post kind of blew up, and I'm glad it got the conversation started about the earnings reports coming out this week from the banks. Got some requests to follow it up with a run-down of other earnings. Might not be able to do them all in timely fashion, but I'll do my best.</p>
<p>This is my run-down on the portion of Investment Banking and Global Markets portion of Goldman Sachs earnings report. I've seen some people get this confused with their overall performance. This is not indicative of other earnings in the earnings report and just an overview of the net revenue for the investment banking portion of the banks earnings. I hope this clears the air for some that may have been confused by my last post.</p>
<p>EDIT: Link to my post on JP Morgan Chase Investment Bank:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojrn47/jp_morgan_why_todays_earnings_release_was_good/">(52) JP Morgan &amp;amp;amp; Why todays earnings release was good for GME : Superstonk (reddit.com)</a> </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Goldman Sachs net revenue fell double digit percentages compared to Q1 2021. However, a common theme among these banks is that they required deposits for their investors to meet margin, lower margins/profit from the Bond market, and more investor leverage in derivative markets (aka options). In other words, the house of cards is crumbling and we've been watching it this entire time and we called it. Enter cheat-code: SHOW ME THE MONEY</strong></p>
<p>Goldman Sachs overall performed like a rock star compared to JP Morgan. Just kidding. They produced over $15 Billion in revenue for Q2 2021 and posted a <strong>WHOPPING 13% NET REVENUE DECREASE compared to Q1 2021.</strong> Overall Goldman Sachs attributes their <em>revenue gains</em> to <em>Asset Management, Investment banking, Consumer &amp; Wealth management</em> and <em>revenue decrease</em> to lower net revenue in <em>Global Markets</em>. I'll step into each of these 1-by-1 starting with...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Investment Banking:</em> Net revenue was $3.61 Billion (-4%). Still a whopping 36% higher than Q2 last year, but seems like the spike from COVID is starting to slow down for them. This was specifically impacted by their higher net revenue from Financial Advisory, Corporate Lending and Underwriting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial Advisory net revenue reflected an increase in completed mergers and acquisition (M&amp;amp;amp;A) transactions. Basically other companies borrowing money to buy up smaller, possibly failing, businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>Corporate Lending revenues reflected higher net interest income. Basically more money from corporate loans. You can probably point to #1 to justify this real easily.</li>
<li>Underwriting net revenue really came from Equity underwriting and primarily driven by huge attention to initial public offerings (IPOs), and partially offset by significant declines in industry-wide secondary offerings. I think we saw this with all the hype around stocks like AirBnB and others.</li>
<li>
<p>Debt underwriting net revenues were lower because of significantly lower industry-wide investment-grade volumes, and offset by elevated industry-wide leveraged finance volumes. Basically they made much less money from bond transactions because of the low volume. Could be municipal or corporate because it doesn't specify. <strong>But they made more money to offset those losses from loans or bonds issued to MORE RISKY OR HIGHLY LEVERAGED COMPANIES.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Global Markets:</em> Net revenue was $4.9 Billion and is a <strong>HUGE NET REVENUE DECREASE OF 35% compared to Q1 2021.</strong> Net revenue in Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), was GET THIS... <strong>45% LOWER THAN Q2 2020!</strong> It doesn't compare it to Q1 for us in this report but we can assume it was still very high. <em>Not as high as JP though (-44%).</em> GS really attributes this to a few things:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower net revenue from FICC intermediation. Being the middleman and market maker for bonds.</p>
</li>
<li>Significantly lower net revenue in interest rate products. Loans can be an example but not the only one.</li>
<li>Credit products and commodities.</li>
<li>Lower net revenue in Mortgages and currencies.</li>
<li>Net Revenue in FICC financing was lower reflecting lower net revenues from repurchase agreements but was partially offset by higher revenue from mortgage lending. Here it sounds like a lot of people are getting out of bonds and RPs but the housing boom saved them. Well for now... I think we all know how the housing market is going..</li>
<li>
<p>Net revenue in Equities was $2.6 Billion and 12% lower than Q2 of 2020. <em>Again, doesnt compare to Q1 2021 and I havent gone to it to compare.</em> Really they attribute this to lower revenue in equities intermediation. Meaning less net revenue from cash products and derivatives. <strong>HOWEVER, net revenue from Equities financing were higher reflecting a HIGHER AVERAGE OF CLIENT BALANCES!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Asset Management:</em> Net revenue was $5.13 Billion up 11% compared to Q1 2021. Primarily driven by significantly higher net revenues in Equity Investments. Lending and debt investments net revenues, Incentive fees and Management and other fees were all higher. Not much to cover that's significant here, but to their credit, they did a great job managing their own assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Consumer &amp;amp;amp; Wealth Management:</em> Net revenue was $1.75 Billion and unchanged from Q1 2021 and 28% higher than Q2 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wealth Management net revenues were $1.4 Billion and 25% higher than Q2 2020. Management and other fees were higher. Basically stating they're managing more money, specifically in private banking (you, the consumer and your stimmy cash) and lending (probably home loans). All this reflecting higher loan balances.</p>
</li>
<li>Consumer Banking net revenues were $363 Million and <strong>41% HIGHER</strong> than Q2 2020 reflecting higher deposit and credit card balances. This could be do to government stimulus and increased debt incurred during a COVID stricken year. Overall this is probably good for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thing I'd like to point out is their Provisions for Credit losses. This is the amount of money they have in reserves to cover losses from credit risk. There's $4.09 Billion in reserves and its only grown this Quarter to a tune of $92 Million. There were overall reserve reductions for wholesale and consumer loans, BUT was partially offset by provisions related to portfolio growth (specifically with credit card loans). So it looks like they've issued more credit card loans. Not really significant but I found it interesting.</p>
<p>Obligatory F in the comments for Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p><em>This is not financial advice and is just my opinion on what the earnings report means for Goldman Sachs. I'm just a retard who likes to gamble and loves GameStop stock.</em></p>
