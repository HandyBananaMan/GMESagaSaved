Ok so, been sick in bed a couple of days and some random shit popped in my head

The NFT part is the same style as nintendo's logo

The part that looks like a cartridge has the etherium stamped on it, and of course the gameboy looks like a gameboy.

But then I started reading  Jordan Holberg's post on Magic the gathering.

(which can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg))

It goes into detail on how Hasbro and Wizards of the coast could use NFT's in multiple actual use scenarios.

One that struck something with me however is that they could basically make sure the secondary market can get rid of the "fake" cards, as any mtg/pokemon/yugioh player can attest the market is rife with knock off products and often it's hard to tell the difference.

But with the Nft being used as a "seal" so that you always know that your card is genuine it could knock out the knockoffs.

You could also use it to build a deck for tournaments, and in theory if someone uses your deck to win you could receive a "kickback", as could the original creators of the art etc etc.

But here is the thing, what about Nintendo?Pokemon is one of the biggest franchises in the world right now, it has videogames, cardgames and so much merchandise, and here is the kicker, remember Amibo's ?

Imagine you have an actual physical model like an Amibo, you train your pokemon and you can then use that same pokemon in several different games, creating a team you can track and use in every future game.

But I digress, here is the thing that got me spinning in circles for most of the day, how could GME use a dividend or NFT by use of pokemon?

Remember those promotions they used to do back in the day?

special cards, special dlc, special stuff.

Enter Crypto kitties, enter Nintendo, enter anything.

I have nothing to back this up as fact, everything in here is speculation but seeing the already pre-established relationship GameStop already has with so many game companies we could see anything be given as a dividend, Be an investor at GME, get a special Halo Hyabusa skin, get a rare pokemon, rare mtg card which you can use in your actual games.

So what do you guys think? could this be something or is this just a bad idea?Also I've flaired this as discussion, because I'd love to see some discussion surrounding this but mostly

\- What actual use could you see happen with NFT's?

It seems u/StrifeLover was posting a theory similar to mine for a while, be sure to check out his posts as he goes more in depth then I do, and he is actually into pokemon and stuff like that and knows more, would love to get people more involved into this!
