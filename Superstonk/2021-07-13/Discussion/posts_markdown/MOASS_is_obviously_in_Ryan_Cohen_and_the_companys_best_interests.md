I'm seeing debates around whether Ryan Cohen or the company would be the catalyst and why that would or wouldn't be the case. 

This is just my opinion, but I feel like the most important factors are being sidelined. 

Ryan Cohen has duties to both his company and its shareholders, the people who invest and have a stake in it. One of the arguments people make is that his job is only to turn the company around and so he can't be relied on to allow MOASS to happen. 

My response to that is in two: how can the company fulfill its ambitions without shaking these detrimental short positions, triggering MOASS, and how effective would the company's comparative transition be without MOASS? 

Overstock struggled for years waiting for aggressive short sellers to close their positions. The SEC was complicit. Eventually, they take matters into their own hands, issue dividends, shorts get squeezed and the stock is thriving to date. They couldn't grow without this happening. 

I'm sure Cohen and his new board are thinking this same way. Shorts must close their positions for GameStop to succeed its potential, and until then it's a heavy burden on the company's growth. In this same vein of thought, Cohen's duty also involves protecting the company's shareholders from predatory, illegal practice, where possible. GameStop is already cooperating with the SEC, awaiting updates, so hopefully this is in motion. 

My second point is triggering the MOASS would be the single greatest tactical decision a company could make. Not only is the stock going to drive insanely high which is good for its inside shareholders (don't forget many of whom have left top executive positions at Amazon and are getting paid *exclusively* in equities), but it would create millions of loyal, newly minted global customers who are going to have your company exceeding earnings expectations every single quarter. Apes are already doing this *without* millions of disposable income.

A forecast of constant quarterly business growth and high employee and customer satisfaction for the foreseeable future is what any chairman and board - especially one in their first few months - could ask for. 

Of course GameStop can turn around into the e-commerce behemoth it is in front of our eyes without MOASS, but just try to imagine the astronomical reach **with it**. I'm positive the board are as aware of this as they were when they signed the contracts to agree they'll be paid solely in equities. 

You add these to the teases we've had from Ryan Cohen and GameStop's social media, and I don't see how it could be construed the company could prevent or have no reason to trigger the MOASS through some kind of corporate action. They know what's happening as much as apes which is evident from the cryptic nods.

Of course, this says nothing about the potential dates; it isn't until it is.

Power to the hodlers.
