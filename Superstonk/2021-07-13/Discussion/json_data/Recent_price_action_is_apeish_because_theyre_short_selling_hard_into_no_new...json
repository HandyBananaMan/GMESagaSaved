    "selftext": "We know retail isn\u2019t selling. Why would retail sell now after holding through all these months when the fundamental picture of the company keeps getting better and better?\n\nAlso the battles around 200, 190, and now 180 are clearly indicative of short sellers pushing it down on one side and retail defending price points on the other.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got a situation where shorts, supposedly some of the most sophisticated financial minds around, are fabricating a selloff and doing it without tying it to any news that could be spun as negative? That\u2019s apeish af. Because they\u2019re offering apes better and better deals on shares, they know for a fact that apes are buying this dip en masse and that barely anybody on the retail side is being fooled into selling, yet they\u2019re pushing it down all the same.",
    "title": "Recent price action is apeish because they\u2019re short selling hard into no news whatsoever. To create a real selloff shorts like to short sell in tandem with bad news. This tells me they HAVE to force the price down now.",
