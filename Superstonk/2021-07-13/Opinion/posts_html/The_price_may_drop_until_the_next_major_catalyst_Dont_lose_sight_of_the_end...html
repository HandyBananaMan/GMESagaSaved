<p>Here's what I think is happening. </p>
<p>DTCC has everything set (via new rules) to vaporize Citadel et al. but they haven't. </p>
<p>Because they are waiting to see if apes crack first.</p>
<p>The price has been steadily dropping. As other apes have pointed out, when volume is low, Citadel has strong influence over the price of the stock. </p>
<p>They know about the hype for this week. They know what the TA indicators are saying. </p>
<p>They also know that if they can drop the price despite all this, some will paper hand. They hope it will be enough to trigger a sell-off.  They hope to survive another day. </p>
<p>But deep down, they also know it won't be enough.  The price could drop to $40 again and enough diamond handed apes will hold. </p>
<p>Eventually there will be a catalyst. Likely very soon. The next T+X cycle or an announcement from GameStop. The price will start to rise. FOMO crowd will jump in. DTCC will say enough is enough. Prepare for lift-off.</p>
<p>If you're tired of holding. I get you. </p>
<p>If you're pissed at the recent price action, I get you. </p>
<p>If tomorrow you are disappointed that the 14th might be a dud, I get you too. </p>
<p>But look. What apes are doing? This has never been done before. And will likely never happen again. The opponent is formidable, but not all powerful. They have a breaking point and it will be found. The only question is will you be there when it happens. </p>
<p>Remember. Through all the fuckery so far apes never left. </p>
<p>And for whatever fuckery happens ahead, apes aren't leaving.</p>
<p>Apes aren't leaving until fuckery is punished and apes get paid.</p>
<p>Ape price or no price.</p>
