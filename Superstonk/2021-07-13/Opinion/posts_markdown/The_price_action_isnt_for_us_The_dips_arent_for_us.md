Just a simple thought. People keep saying "do they really think we're selling?" and the answer is no. They know you won't sell. They are screwed, yeah.

The dips. The volume. The price slowly lowering. It's not for us.

Like a creature playing dead, SHFs are manipulating the price so that other institutional players don't buy in. They won't convince us, but they can throw off technical indicators that might make other large investors stay clear. Or make it too risky.

So yes, we buy these dips, and they are aware and there's nothing they can do about it. They just HAVE to make it look like it's a slow sell off or else the whole financial world will FOMO in and then it's game over anon, even if it means selling more shares into the hands of us ape's who got nothing better to do on a Tuesday except HODL.
