It's simple- the DD have named names, they have made what would be *fantastical* claims of fraud, malfeasance, and theft, and they have done so publicly over and over again, **and there has been no legal action taken to stop them or claim they are wrong.**

If the SHFs were truly innocent of any or all of the claims, surely one of them would have filed a libel or slander charge against the creators of the written or video DD, and as far as I have seen, there has been none.

Now, some of you might be thinking, "But u/iamthinksnow, maybe we haven't heard about anything because they aren't allowed to talk about ongoing legal actions!" Sure, good point, but let me reply by pointing out that they also *wouldn't be continuing to post new findings.* Q.E.D.
