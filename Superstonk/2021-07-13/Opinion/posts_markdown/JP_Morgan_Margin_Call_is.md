... is a new way, for the future articles, of telling people, that shorts have covered. Price might jump this week (as a lot of people suggest, even tho NO DATES) and then will tank (as always) and a new ground for media to spam, that shorts have covered is born. How retail "won" and blah blah blah... I have never seen articles of banks warning their HFS about these things... But I have never looked in to it either, but feels kinda sus... Stay Frosty, don't believe everything you read, even me. I can be Kenny himself for all you know.
