I won't have time until next few days to post into my DD about wash trading, which I think it's incredibly relevent for the price we're seeing right now, so I will lay out the skeleton here:

I propose the missing link to understanding how Citadel is manipulating the price of GME lately, is that they are manipulating the NBBO of GME directly. Quick reminder - the NBBO is the 'waveguide' / 'channel' that all GME trades are required to trade within (due to the Order Protection Rule), except for Odd lots (which can be better than the price). **The NBBO is formed from the best ROUND LOT bids and offers on given exchanges. Odd lots do not affect the NBBO - they are excluded from the calculation.**

All you need to do to lower the Offer side of the NBBO, is to sell a Round lot, for less than anyone currently is - that's it. Once you keep dragging the Offer side of the NBBO down, this will lower the price too.

**So what Citadel et al are doing with the left hand, is offering to sell round lots on the public exchange, for less than the current price. This lowers the 'Offer' side of the NBBO. With their right hand, Citadel place Odd lot buy orders in the dark pools / OTC, for slightly higher than what they are selling on the lit exchange - creating an arbitrage opportunity for other parties.**

**What other parties see from this, is a 'round lot' for sale on the lit exchange for say $179.50, and they see plenty of Odd lot purchases in the dark pools for $180. If they buy the round lot, and then sell it piecewise on the dark pool into Odd lots - they make $50** (if it was 100 shares)

**Then they do this again, except they go slightly lower price, and again, and again.**

Crucially, by performing this action repeatedly BOTH sides are committing wash trading (which I should remind - the penalties are hardly severe, and my previous DD possibly implicated Citadel committing wash trading in China). The price difference, is the incentive for a 2nd party to commit wash trading and become complicit in the fraud.

\[Edit: Note that the Odd lots aspect doesn't require dark pools / OTC. **Odd lots hide the buying pressure, dark pools hide the buyer & seller's identity**\]

# What evidence would we expect to see?

**We would see plenty of Odd lot trades in the dark pools / OTC, and they would be slightly higher priced:**

Here's the 10th June: FINRA ADF data (a place you can report your dark pool trades to) - 1.7m volume, average trade size 19 shares ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9m342/finra\_adf\_today\_with\_the\_highest\_total\_volume\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9m342/finra_adf_today_with_the_highest_total_volume_of/) ), and their known participants (Jane street, JP Morgan securities: [https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/adf/participants](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/adf/participants) ), we can deduce they are likely involved.

This ape found Odd lot trades outside the NBBO in dark pools: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7ahcl/found\_something\_funky\_on\_the\_dark\_pools/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7ahcl/found_something_funky_on_the_dark_pools/)  \[Edit: Dave has commented to the OP of this linked post saying that the NBBO data the OP sourced was perhaps delayed and thus he doubted the conclusion. **However**, even with a delayed NBBO, a measured correlation between Odd lots and the NBBO would not be expected, assuming the price behaves approximately randomly. I.e. **The Autocorrelation of a uniform random process (this approximates short-term stock prices), very quickly drops off to zero**.\]

Blackrock comments on the Odd lots proposal: [https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/BlackRock\_Odd\_Lot\_Proposal\_December\_3\_2019.pdf](https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/BlackRock_Odd_Lot_Proposal_December_3_2019.pdf)

We thought months ago it was dark pools hiding the buys, but people such as Dave Lauer showed that this is not true, as all trades need to be reported to the tape. It is the Odd lots that provide the hiding of the buying pressure - they are the secret sauce. Many other apes have indeed found that the dark pools are FULL of GME Odd lots, and one ape even found that they were above the NBBO (although based on imperfect data).

In summary, I will write this up properly, but it's super relevent today - so I let the skeleton outside :)
