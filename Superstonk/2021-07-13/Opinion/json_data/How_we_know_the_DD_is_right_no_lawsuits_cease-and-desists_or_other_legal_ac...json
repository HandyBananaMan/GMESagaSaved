    "selftext": "It's simple- the DD have named names, they have made what would be *fantastical* claims of fraud, malfeasance, and theft, and they have done so publicly over and over again, **and there has been no legal action taken to stop them or claim they are wrong.**\n\nIf the SHFs were truly innocent of any or all of the claims, surely one of them would have filed a libel or slander charge against the creators of the written or video DD, and as far as I have seen, there has been none.\n\nNow, some of you might be thinking, \"But u/iamthinksnow, maybe we haven't heard about anything because they aren't allowed to talk about ongoing legal actions!\" Sure, good point, but let me reply by pointing out that they also *wouldn't be continuing to post new findings.* Q.E.D.\n\n\n**Edit to add:** [even award winning journalists agree](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojhgph/a_journalists_view_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",
