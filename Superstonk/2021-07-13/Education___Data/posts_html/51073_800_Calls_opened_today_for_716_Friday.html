<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-trading-volume-and-open-interest/">Volume and open interest</a> are two key technical metrics that describe the liquidity and activity of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-options-and-futures/">options and futures</a> contracts. "Volume" refers to the number ofÂ contracts traded in a given period, and "open interest" denotesÂ the number of contracts that are active, or not settled. Here, we examine these two metrics and offer tips for how you can use them to understand trading activity in the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp">derivatives</a> markets.  </p>
