Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes across the world! üëãü¶ç

Yesterday was clearly a wonderful day to HODL GME, since *nobody* was selling! Volume was ridiculously low for a Monday, yet the stock we like still had a fantastic sideways run. Somehow the Lego memes had even drier volume. Many signs are pointing toward a breakout for volume in the near future, so each sidways day until then is just another day for more apes to read the DD, buy their shares, and support GameStop with their business. Today is Tuesday, July 13th and you know what that means! GMErican Apes are (or should be!) asleep, so join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange!

###üöÄ Buckle Up! üöÄ

FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from a single German exchange and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18713948. There are occasionally small differences in price that are below the rounding error to two decimal places, which can lead to colorful boxes without obvious price change. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)

Many among the Diamantenh√§nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Two weeks ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.

Diamantenh√§nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!
