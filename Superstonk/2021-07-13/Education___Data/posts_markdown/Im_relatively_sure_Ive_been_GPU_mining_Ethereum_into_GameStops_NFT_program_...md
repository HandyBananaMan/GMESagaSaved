# Title: I'm relatively sure I've been GPU mining Ethereum into GameStop's NFT program. I use the transaction address from GameStop's NFT page. This miner wouldn't run/hash without a working address, and I removed my crypto wallet from the equation entirely. Anything to help along my favorite stock! 💎👐
