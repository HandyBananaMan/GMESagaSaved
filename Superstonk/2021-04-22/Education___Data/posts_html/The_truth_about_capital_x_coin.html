<p>There are 3-4 posts trying to connect the perceived increase of this to some kind of hedge fund activity. </p>
<p>Look it up on https://coinmarketcap.com . It tells you which exchanges offer the coin, where the volume distribution is, and the price at each. </p>
<p>The three exchanges are 1. BKEX 2. AOFEX and 3. DragonEX. </p>
<p>Right now, 100% of the volume is listed on BKEX (earlier, when the posts first came in, it was 99.91%) The price on that exchange is currently $4.71 </p>
<p>There was a trade on DragonEx to artificially reflect the price as $3,231.67. The real price is $4.71. You can look this up yourself at the link I posted above. </p>
<p>This will be my last post/comment here. The stuff like this being accepted and promoted without being fact checked is a problem, (especially if you understand misinformation campaigns)  but really, it’s because when I reveal a truth like this, I’m called a shill, told to suck hedgie dicks, and downvoted by everyone who sees it.</p>
<p>I except the same treatment here. Posting the truth when it’s contrary to the bias has become a threat to the people here. And for that reason, I’m out</p>
