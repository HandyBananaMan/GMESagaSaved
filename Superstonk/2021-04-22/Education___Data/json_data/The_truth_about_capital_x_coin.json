    "selftext": "There are 3-4 posts trying to connect the perceived increase of this to some kind of hedge fund activity. \n\n\nLook it up on https://coinmarketcap.com . It tells you which exchanges offer the coin, where the volume distribution is, and the price at each. \n\nThe three exchanges are 1. BKEX 2. AOFEX and 3. DragonEX. \n\nRight now, 100% of the volume is listed on BKEX (earlier, when the posts first came in, it was 99.91%) The price on that exchange is currently $4.71 \n\nThere was a trade on DragonEx to artificially reflect the price as $3,231.67. The real price is $4.71. You can look this up yourself at the link I posted above. \n\nThis will be my last post/comment here. The stuff like this being accepted and promoted without being fact checked is a problem, (especially if you understand misinformation campaigns)  but really, it\u2019s because when I reveal a truth like this, I\u2019m called a shill, told to suck hedgie dicks, and downvoted by everyone who sees it.\n\nI except the same treatment here. Posting the truth when it\u2019s contrary to the bias has become a threat to the people here. And for that reason, I\u2019m out",
