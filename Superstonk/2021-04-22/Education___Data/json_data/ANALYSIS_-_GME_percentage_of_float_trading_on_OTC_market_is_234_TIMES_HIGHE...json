I found out that the average trading volume divided by the float for Dow 30 stocks is 2.80%. One outlier was Boeing Company with 16.80% of float. Most of them were between 1.2% and 4.4%. For GME this is **655.80%** of float! This is 234 times higher than \u2018normal stocks\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional analysis by** u/Important-Ad6786:\n\n*\"Downloaded the outstanding share numbers and this FINRA data for 9,000 companies.*\n\n*Filtered out companies with a market cap smaller than $5 billion, and then sorted them by ratio of OTC reported shares traded to the number of oustanding shares.*\n\n*Outstanding shares isn't the same as float, but still provides a good picture of how anomalous this is.*\n\n*This provides some insight as even among lower market cap companies, GME is still anomalous with 400%+ shares trades compared to the number of outstanding shares.\"*\n\n[Comparison of shares traded as % of outstanding shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mw2p3j/analysis_gme_percentage_of_float_trading_on_otc/gvfvesq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nFiles used: [https://github.com/NibbieHub/FinraOTCdata](https://github.com/NibbieHub/FinraOTCdata)\n\nStock float data: [https://finance.yahoo.com/](https://finance.yahoo.com/)\n\nOTC trading data: [https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcIssueData](https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcIssueData)\n\nDow 30 stocks: [https://www.cnbc.com/dow-30/](https://www.cnbc.com/dow-30/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
