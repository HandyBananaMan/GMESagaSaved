Hey Apes!

I did a comparison between the trading data (February 2021) on the OTC from the Dow 30 stocks and GME. I found out that the average trading volume divided by the float for Dow 30 stocks is 2.80%. One outlier was Boeing Company with 16.80% of float. Most of them were between 1.2% and 4.4%. For GME this is **655.80%** of float! This is 234 times higher than ‘normal stocks’.

**Additional analysis by** u/Important-Ad6786:

*"Downloaded the outstanding share numbers and this FINRA data for 9,000 companies.*

*Filtered out companies with a market cap smaller than $5 billion, and then sorted them by ratio of OTC reported shares traded to the number of oustanding shares.*

*Outstanding shares isn't the same as float, but still provides a good picture of how anomalous this is.*

*This provides some insight as even among lower market cap companies, GME is still anomalous with 400%+ shares trades compared to the number of outstanding shares."*
