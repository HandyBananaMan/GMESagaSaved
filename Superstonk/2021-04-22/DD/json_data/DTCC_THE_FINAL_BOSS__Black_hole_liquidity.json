So he has a Failure to Deliver (FTD) sitting there at the NSCC \u2013 an IOU to the NSCC for shares. The NSCC is in charge of guaranteeing delivery to the buyer, so the NSCC either dips into the SBP (SHARE BORROW PROGRAM) and borrows some shares to give to the buyer, or if there aren't enough shares at the SBP the trade moves \u201cEx-Clearing\u201d \u2013 outside of the DTCC system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cEx-Clearing\u201d is where the buying broker and the selling broker make a contractual agreement to handle delivery of the shares off-line, outside the system. Nobody polices these arrangements, so there is no way of knowing when, if ever, the shares are delivered \u2013 that is between the two brokers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis results in share counterfeiting, as the buyer is represented to have received valid \u201cShare Entitlements\u201d when in fact they are nothing of the sort, until the book-entry shares are delivered \u2013 which may never happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo share counterfeiting can occur in a number of ways, but always because of the same factors \u2013 the buyer\u2019s broker misrepresents invalid \u201cShare Entitlements\u201d as real to his client.\n\nPretty simple. It is all driven by Wall Street not wanting to have to give back commissions when shares are un-delivered. So a flood of fake \u201cShare Entitlements\u201d \u2013 counterfeit shares \u2013 are traded in the system as real, and as long as all the brokers treat the fakes as though they are real, everyone on the industry side of the fence wins big \u2013 more trades, more commissions, more shares with which to drive down prices for the large, super-important customers of Wall Street \u2013 the hedge funds. That is what is known as creating \u201cliquidity\u201d by creating fake shares. It is pervasive, and the SEC and DTCC refuse to tell anyone exactly how big the problem is, or to divulge the size of the problem by company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Everyone on Wall Street \u2013 the financial press, the brokers, the DTCC/NSCC/DTC, the research firms, the banks \u2013 all have a ton to lose by this being understood by Main Street America.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Continuous Net Settlement System (CNS). A system implemented by Wall Street to speed transaction processing, which nets sales against purchases, and against the accounts of DTCC participants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does it have to do with the magnitude of the Fail To Deliver (FTD) problem?\n\nTurns out, a lot.\n\nBecause of the netting, many delivery failures never show up as such at the DTCC, and consequently are never reported. The DTCC literally doesn't know they exist. How can that be?\n\nHere's an example created  by Dr. Susanne Trimbath , PhD, an authority on the clearing and settlement system:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s what happens if you settle trade for trade\n\nSell \u201cDeliver\u201d at customer account level (some level below your DTCC account)\n\n\\-100    \n\\+0  \n\n\\-200    \n\\+200  \n\n\\-500    \n\\+500  \n\n\\-800    \n\\+700  \n\ni.e., you are short 100 shares at this level, with 200 shares failed to be delivered and received\n\nNow look what happens at the end of the same day after NSCC Account nets to the -800shares position:\n\nSeller\u2019s DTCC Free Account\n\n9,000\n\nNSCC settlement: -800\n\nBalance after settlement: 8,200\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are no failures to deliver at NSCC that day because there were sufficient shares in the sellers free account to cover their bill\n\nTa-dah! Netting hides the failure to deliver\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn other words, Prime Broker A could have, say, 1 million long shares of NFI in their account, and during the course of the day, several of their big hedge fund customers could fail 400,000 shares, and those would never show up as FTDs because the CNS system would net the fails against their securities in their account, essentially netting the fails against shares in their DTC account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's how it was further clarified by Dr. Trimbath:\n\n\"For your question, you need to follow through to the DTC account, where shares are taken automatically for CNS settlement by NSCC. Here, we\u2019re talking about a hedge fund that failed to deliver to Prime Broker A, a specific trade that failed delivery. However, because the \u201cfree\u201d shares are taken from Prime Broker A\u2019s account there is no reported failure to deliver at NSCC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf, for example, the failure is in IBM, and Prime Broker A has a ton of shares hanging around the house account, then those get swept up for delivery and there is no failure in CNS. There is a failure in the system somewhere, but the DTCC never sees it. Prime Broker A should be tracking it, we hope, to be sure they get the shares... But there are no SEC rules about Prime Broker A reporting that. (From what I\u2019ve seen in NYSE audits, the Prime Broker A's of the world aren\u2019t keeping very good records on this sort of thing, frankly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow what if those are NFI, and Prime Broker A doesn\u2019t have a ton of shares hanging around the house account? Now, there\u2019s nothing to get swept out for settlement and you get a reported FTD from NSCC. This helps explain why smaller companies show up on threshold lists more often\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, so I get it. CNS nets against the NSCC accounts of the participants, and the only FTDs that are reported are trades over and above whatever each participant has on account, after all trades for the day are netted against each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo realistically, delivery failures hidden by the CNS system could be much larger than what shows up as FTDs at the DTCC, given that 90+% of all trades are netted. Literally, most of the issued shares of a company on account at the DTCC via brokers could be used up in netting BEFORE the first FTD showed up as we think of them, or as they would show up on a FOIA request.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow think about that for a second.\n\nhow much is due to the slop in the system - the CNS hidden delivery failures? Nobody knows.\n\nSo what does that say about market integrity?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTry this one out. In addition to CNS netting hiding the true level of delivery failures, we also have ex-clearing, wherein failures are moved out of the system and treated as a contractual agreement between two brokers - thus out of, or \"ex\", clearing system. Nobody really knows how large that is, either. And foreign clearing firms also net behind their own curtain, further minimizing the problem's size.\n\n**Are you starting to get it now?**\n\nand further consider how much is hidden behind the curtain of CNS.\n\nHow's that for scary?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR : The short way of saying it is that CNS netting could easily be minimizing the apparent FTDs problem by 90+%. .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DTCC & COUNTERFEIT SHARES\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe key to naked short selling fraudsters is to get these trades involving the sale of nonexistent shares to \u201cClear\u201d even though \u201cSettlement\u201d Which involves the \u201cdelivery\u201d of that which was thought to be being bought i.e. genuine \u201cshares\u201d or \u201cpackages of rights\u201d attached to a specific U.S. Corporation may never occur. The \u201cAutomated Stock Borrow Program\u201d at the DTCC allows shares held in \u201cStreet name\u201d at the DTCC to be borrowed from an anonymous \u201cLending Pool\u201d of shares. This allows the firm of the buyer of these nonexistent shares to receive delivery of \u201csomething\u201d that at least resembles a legitimate share at first glance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that the buying firm is allowed to immediately place these \u201cShares or share facsimiles\u201d right back into this same anonymous \u201cLending pool\u201d of shares **AS IF THEY NEVER LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE BUYING FIRM IS THEN HANDSOMELY REWARDED BY THE DTCC WITH THE CASH EQUIVALENT OF THE SHARES DEPOSITED INTO THE POOL AND CHOSEN TO CLEAR THE NEXT FAILED DELIVERY. THIS WONDERFUL ABILITY TO CONVERT A CLIENT\u2019S PURCHASES OF REAL SHARES OR \u201cPSEUDOSHARES\u201d INTO CASH FOR THE USE OF THE BROKERDEALER PROVIDES PLENTY OF INCENTIVE TO KEEP THE \u201cLENDING POOL\u201d FULL TO CAPACITY.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE SELF-REPLENISHING ASPECT ALSO HELPS KEEP IT FULL TO ADDRESS AS MANY \u201cFAILED DELIVERIES\u201d AS THE SYSTEM WILL GENERATE WHICH IS AN INFINITE AMOUNT IF NO REGULATOR MONITORS FOR THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE USE OF THE \u201cBONA FIDE\u201d MM EXEMPTION FROM BORROWING BEFORE SHORT SELLING\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The \u201cCounterfeit Electronic Book Entries\u201d \u201cCEBEs\u201d-electronic book entries at the DTCC without a certificated share in a DTCC vault to justify its existence that result from the lack of buying-in these failed deliveries then appear on investors\u2019 monthly statements as readily-sellable \u201cPseudo-shares\u201d despite the fact that there is no paper certificate in a DTCC vault to justify its existence. Keep in mind that the DTCC at all times has full visibility of the number of \u201cCEBEs\u201d as well as genuine shares held in their vaults. The \u201cSupply\u201d variable that interacts with the \u201cDemand\u201d variable to determine share price then becomes the arithmetic sum of all genuine paper-backed electronic book entries at the DTCC plus the number of \u201cCounterfeit Electronic Book Entries\u201d. This greatly enhanced \u201cSupply of readily-sellable shares\u201d then interacts with a greatly diminished \u201cEffective Demand\u201d for shares due to buy orders for shares being effectively neutralized by the sale of nonexistent shares into these buy orders resulting in the typical precipitous drop in the share price of the preyed upon U.S. Corporation. This allows the unknowing investors\u2019 funds to flow into the lap of those that sold nonexistent \u201cEntities\u201d but still refuse to cover*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Dr Jim Decosta Against abusive shorts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDr Jim Decosta sent many letters to sec trying to change the abuse but we all know sec does nothing.\n\nbut he fought for many years along time ago  and he is extremely knowledgeable about all of this thats going on .\n\nhowever I can not find much information on him other than his letters\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"As the \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d of all shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d Cede and Co. as the nominee of the DTC subdivision would clearly be empowered to execute buyins when the shares that they are acting as the \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d of on behalf of the purchaser never showed up. Acting as the \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d has fiduciary duties attached. Any market intermediary acting as the \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d on behalf of the purchaser of securities would according to UCC Article 8 \u201cexercise due care in accordance with reasonable commercial standards to obtain and maintain the financial asset\u201d. This \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d would owe a fiduciary duty of care to the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of these securities i.e. the investor that paid for them. Cede and Co. was to take on the role of the \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d of all shares held in \u201cstreet name\u201d ONLY in an effort to enhance efficiencies otherwise each stock transaction would necessitate the cumbersome transfer of deed-like instruments. It was strictly forbidden to utilize this \u201csurrogate legal ownership\u201d title and role as LEVERAGE over the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d that purchased the shares whom this \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d theoretically represents. Note that if the investor purchasing securities were to remain the \u201clegal owner\u201d it would obviously be given access to the information revealing that what he \u201cowns\u201d never got delivered. This generous volunteering of the DTC to act as the \u201csurrogate legal owner\u201d cleverly results in the purchaser of shares not realizing that the securities he purchased never did get delivered. Why? In the case of abusive naked short selling it\u2019s because they never existed in the first place.'*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" A bona fide MM would rather sell nonexistent shares at a higher level than at a lower level UNLESS HIS CURRENT NAKED SHORT POSITION HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND TO THE POINT THAT COLLATERALIZING AN ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH NAKED SHORT POSITION AT HIGHER LEVELS MIGHT BE COST PROHIBITIVE.

It is said to be self-replenishing because once a share is borrowed by the NSCC, and delivered to the buyer, the buyer\u2019s broker is free to put that same share back into the pool, to be relent out again to someone else.
