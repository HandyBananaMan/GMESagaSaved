**TL;DR: Margin is calling. Below is a list of a bunch of other stocks that SPECIFICALLY CITADEL is shorting into oblivion to make money to pay for their debt. Oh, by the way, it's not working out for them.**

**Not financial advice. I just like the stock. All of them.**

I'll keep this short and sweet, it's just a bunch of Ortex/FINRA data on **stocks that** **Citadel is MASS PRINTING** to make their money back. You will see some crazy shit here.

The goal of this DD is to **show the correlation between some MASSIVELY shorted stocks that have yet to cover as of 4/22** and **Citadel's involvement within the OTC/Dark Pools.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start with the tendie man, $GME as our reference. Remember that **the short data for $GME is MASSIVELY INACCURATE because they have only pretended to cover by buying ITM calls.**

&#x200B;

![GME Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/fm867xvi5vu61.jpg?width=1719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48701a9a1a47417437217a6310105ccbbdb62103)

We know already what's going on with $GME, don't need to get into it. Same for $AMC. I would post photos of the Ortex and FINRA data but Reddit has a 20 image post limit. Dumb, but I'm sure you get the point.

Okay, here's where things get **CRAZY.** Have you heard of **Ocugen? ($OCGN)**

Neither had I. Until I noticed that **THE ENTIRE THING IS SHORTED TO 100% UTILIZATION AND MORE THAN THE FLOAT (189M) TRADED TODAY, 4/22.**

&#x200B;

![$OCGN Ortex. THEY ARE MAXED OUT.](https://preview.redd.it/v36lkbuk5vu61.jpg?width=1711&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f3b4301bf00da705aa9db70ce2a9d656be8eda0)

Here's the weird thing: **THE PRICE IS GOING** ***UP.*** Shorted stocks **DON'T GO UP. Unless... YOU'RE PRINTING SHARES JUST TO PRINT THEM TO MAKE MONEY WITH NO REPERCUSSIONS.**

Don't believe me? Well...

&#x200B;

![$OCGN FINRA. MORE THAN THE FLOAT was traded 4\/22.](https://preview.redd.it/us7ezvto5vu61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=731f526548937e2abc195cb52b210e43f2b94974)

Did I mention that **THE PUBLIC FLOAT OF $OCGN IS ONLY 189M? SEEMS SUS...**

It goes deeper. Ever heard of $VXRT? You know, **THE ONE WITH THE NEGATIVE BETA?**

&#x200B;

![$VXRT Marketwatch \(I know they're \\"The enemy,\\" shut up lol\)](https://preview.redd.it/ure7yeir5vu61.jpg?width=978&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9915c45bbb88631f3a16f8c6886d752813227d28)

**Hmm I wonder if it's been shorted...**

&#x200B;

![$VXRT Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/janmdn1u5vu61.jpg?width=1714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b552d07b4f5b4d11f79c96b5fd2510e9e0885e4)

**HMM, THAT'S STRANGE... BY CITADEL? YOU PRINTING SHARES OVER THERE?**

&#x200B;

![$VXRT FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/lowjb5hv5vu61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee8fec92aeaffbbd7c92643131517dfeb87e847c)

Well, isn't that interesting. Keep in mind too that the stock is **GOING UP** as well, meaning since they can't pull out, **THEY MUST GO DEEPER.** Just kidding, although remember that they **MAKE MONEY** printing shares, and demand has shot up for $VXRT.

Okay so what else? How about:

1. $FSR: **134M Float**
2. $NKLA: **169M Float**
3. $SKLZ: **227M Float**
4. $MVIS: **155M Float**
5. $RIOT: **82M Float**
6. $ALDX: **38M Float**
7. $BNGO: **276M Float**

Yup. And those are just the ones I found in a couple of hours. The list is **most likely enormous.**

You want the data? **Here's the data with comments on each image:**

Here's **$FSR:**

&#x200B;

![$FSR got DEMOLISHED. The best part? Price is going back up, and it doesn't look like it's Citadel covering...](https://preview.redd.it/qntpq2ox5vu61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8f9dc14da3bb320ff11a136353563c0a30f6f8c)

Here's **$NKLA:** Look at that **HUGE spike in volume, and there AIN'T NO SHORTS BEING COVERED.**

&#x200B;

![$NKLA Ortex. \\"I'm JACKED! I'M JACKED TO THE TITS!\\"](https://preview.redd.it/de6tef166vu61.jpg?width=1719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfed87f6aa0c4d770ddd11321a8034e2003aeff7)

&#x200B;

![$NKLA FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/a9dlrnx76vu61.jpg?width=1135&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd0ba2a4b0e2f1580cc1a9431514eb4c280ed55e)

Here's $SKLZ. **Look at the price action at the end. It's GOING UP despite the short interest. Someone AIN'T COVERING.**

&#x200B;

![$SKLZ Ortex. Something's brewing here...](https://preview.redd.it/z78x3cw96vu61.jpg?width=1719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e436cdfcbaed19a79fcf65a269e5c894bc970f)

Here's **$MVIS, a WallStreetBets favorite.**

&#x200B;

![$MVIS Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/siwo0dud6vu61.jpg?width=1720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33706ffd91d59270f261e69a3a3d63db92bb7f49)

Here's **$RIOT.** Did you know that **THEY SHORTED IT BY TWICE ITS FLOAT OTC? (82M)?**

&#x200B;

![$RIOT Ortex. How dumb do you have to be to SHORT THE RIOT BLOCKCHAIN. LIKE THAT ISN'T GONNA BE A BAD DECISION.](https://preview.redd.it/1qys7unh6vu61.jpg?width=1716&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ba26118eb5f8204d0de2280e181727ce7802a0a)

&#x200B;

Here's **$ALDX.**

&#x200B;

![A tiny one, but remember that selling shorts \(that are presumably naked\) MAKE CITADEL MONEY. It's implied that they will cover, but naked shorting typically doesn't have the intention of needing to cover.](https://preview.redd.it/amijboyl6vu61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=187fcbf1c51f4ff799d7c48b5814fcdf4fd27a78)

&#x200B;

Here's **$BNGO. Again, look at the price action. It's going UP. And if shorts AREN'T RESPONSIBLE for it, then MARGIN CALLS will be coming for similar situations.**

&#x200B;

![$BNGO Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/qy42t2tr6vu61.jpg?width=1705&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0515dbe5a840b7aa7dbd83ecfc54bee3d020548d)

**So what have we learned?**

**Buy more $GME. Buy more $AMC.** You can risk the other ones in this list, **but personally I like the stonk.** The way we win this thing **is if we HODL ON WHILE THE PRICE CLIMBS,** and while these stonks certainly can and most likely will go up, **they are more of a demonstration that Citadel and friends are most certainly fuk.** These stonks are shorted into oblivion to stave Citadel its execution, **which is coming for them very soon.**

Edit 1: Added some clarification, added "not financial advice," clarified that we actually just really like the stonk.
