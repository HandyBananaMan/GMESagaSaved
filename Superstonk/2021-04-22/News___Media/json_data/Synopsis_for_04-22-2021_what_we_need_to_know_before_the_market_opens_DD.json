    "selftext": "Good morning San Diago,\n\nI am Rensole,\n\nDo you smell that?\n\n\\*insert flashy intro card\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64mg5duhsou61.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bb5ad1ada26c307f30c9f50a40cc2f4a0fb7bac\n\n# They are using trucks now!\n\nSo yesterday I saw this was getting a lot of traction:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mvmtpy/looks\\_like\\_shitadel\\_is\\_hard\\_at\\_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mvmtpy/looks_like_shitadel_is_hard_at_work/)\n\nOMG NOES.\n\nSeriously guys relax, this is normal.\n\nIn Europe you have to dispose of materials which have confidential information (client's names, addresses and or other stuff), then you need to shred it and dispose of it with a correct method and show this to the oversight committee that you disposed of it properly, you can't just throw it in a dumpster and be done with it.\n\nAs an example, in the EU you need to keep your (accounting) books for 5 years minimum, then after that you need to dispose of it, so you call a professional company to dispose of it.\n\nEven though we would all love this to be proof of illegal activity, it's not it's more \"business as usual then anything else.\n\ngdpr\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w16tgyaktou61.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2659c1c370c751f8b1cc9c74b66ac8143c1076f\n\n# Some things about the sub\n\nI've seen a continuing trend emerge, people wanting to get the drones up and check what they're doing 24/7, cherry-picking data etc.\n\nDrones;\n\nAs for the drones I'll be easy, you want to take pictures from street level because you notice something fine be my guest, but flying a drone and shoot video inside offices its where we have to draw a line. Because you may believe this is innocent but I think it's (at minimum) ethically questioning.\n\nSo from now on, you post a drone video you will receive a temp ban, continued breaking will result in perma ban.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso something else that's REALLY bad imo is this:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi8yi7/everything\\_short\\_author\\_uatobitt\\_explains\\_how\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi8yi7/everything_short_author_uatobitt_explains_how_the/)\n\nShit like this wont be allowed here anymore either, like holy shit do you guys really not see how this comes across ? the weapons aimed at his head is a step to far, honestly it's 10 steps to far, imagine people from the outside seeing this and it's easy to write this entire sub off.\n\nBecause putting guns to peoples heads (even in drawings) can be seen as death threats, and that is NOT what this is about WE are all here because WE LIKE THE STOCK.\n\nMeming is one thing but this goes to far imo, if we want to be taken seriously we should act as a serious sub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCherry picking;\n\nsomething I have a huge personal problem with is looking at an entire datasheet and people take only parts of it to build their thesis. You either use it in full or you don't use it, it's like saying all cars have 700 HP because I only used supercars in my control group, it just does not work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have fought against other people thinking we are idiots, or a cult or whatever, the only way we can break those ideas and get taken seriously, is that we act as serious as normal investors. sure you can have memes you can have a laugh but realise that we want to be taken seriously we need to act accordingly.\n\nSo let's go and keep the tinfoil hatting at a minimum from now on, and start doing serious thought out DD. there is a reason WSB lived as long as it does so let's drop the tinfoil and research more. I hope you guys can agree with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther subs;\n\nA lot of (new) posters are trying to stir shit up, saying other people are shills at the drop of a hat, same goes for other subs so let me be extremely clear about this.\n\nWe like the other subs, I like WSB/GME/DDintoGME etc, you may not agree with how they run their subs and that's a personal thing, but do note that if we see hurtful comments made against other subs/mods of those subs we will take action, as we are one community and we should not allow shit flinging.\n\nAgain if you have an issue, lets deal with it as adults, no emotion but facts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ua5rv2dwou61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=8276fd25382d034696db4aa59f58eb5ca025d967\n\n# The man with the plan\n\nThe US Senate Confirms Gensler as the SEC Chief to a full five year term\n\n[https://thehill.com/policy/finance/549312-senate-confirms-sec-chief-gensler-to-full-five-year-term](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/549312-senate-confirms-sec-chief-gensler-to-full-five-year-term)\n\nGlad to hear he's got the full 5 year appointment as imo wall street is a big machine with big parts who don't want to move or change, but giving him another 5 years means he can at least get some things moving and hopefully change it for the better.\n\nAnd by the looks of it it seems he hit the ground running\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vuqznhpwou61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8567d3bd69546cd64b3c48ebc038f644313dae0\n\nThe Sec said to examine fund disclosure rules after archegos, taken from bloomberg tv breaking news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ufz7mbhwou61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ea8d8ad7060a2deea1466b1a50ca11b93681cf3\n\nGamestop has announced another Amazon veteran to head the fulfillment stuff, glad to have you onboard Josh!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DTC-2021-007\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvh4yy/dtc2021007\\_signed\\_april\\_20\\_2021\\_is\\_forcing\\_all/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvh4yy/dtc2021007_signed_april_20_2021_is_forcing_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nGreat write up on what the DTC 007 rule could mean. it would be effective on July 9th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DTCC-2021-005\n\nNow this is a little bit of a hot topic, the rule was suddenly removed on the 12th this month, I remember someone contacting someone up high about this, the rule was removed due to a \"filing\" error, there was something wrong with how the document was set up, but it should get back on the website soon, that has now been close to two weeks.\n\nNow I'm addressing it because I've seen a lot of people post about it (or it just caught my eye more), it could very well be that it was a clerical error and it needs to be readded so we just have to wait and see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/edh721j5you61.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f774cc7916dfb1e1fabf0fd247b97c322f1809\n\n# EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\nRemember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixd03zqazou61.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=43ad3e551f20976aa3a1ca1c255206b3e8c68e82\n\nRemember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.\n\nbackups:\n\n[https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/](https://gmebackup.tumblr.com/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/HeyItsPixel1](https://twitter.com/HeyItsPixel1)\n\n[https://twitter.com/warden\\_elite](https://twitter.com/warden_elite)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\n[https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid)\n\nAnd

Rule 15C3-3 established the requirement to keep enough cash and securities in a segregated account that will cover a portion of the costs of a major market move.
