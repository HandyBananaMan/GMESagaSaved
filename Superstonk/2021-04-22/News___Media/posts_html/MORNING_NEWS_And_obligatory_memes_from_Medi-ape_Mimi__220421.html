<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fed_smoker69420/">fed_smoker6942</a> says in the comments:</p>
<p><em>"Another interesting point is that they banned advisers from promoting GME and AMC back in January:</em></p>

<p><em>I noticed a lot of their branches closed in my area as well when I was looking at BofA closures."</em></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Apes have also been having trouble with J.P. Morgan-Chase:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/33a/">u/33a</a> reports that his GME transfer requests have been cancelled 3 times!</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>This is all explained here by</strong>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/grogosaur83/"><strong>u/grogosaur83</strong></a> <strong>In his post. He states:</strong></p>
<p><em>"Hedges are now faced with infinite losses. Banks are now faced with a lot of defunct unpaid loans. A lot of investment products are worthless like the mortgage backed securities of 2008. The toxic assets are probably everywhere in the financial world.</em></p>
<p><em>Bank of America, JP Morgan and another bank (Goldman I think) one recently offered bonds that when combined, totalled over $34b. They're selling bonds which are debts for their own business. Their business is about to become worthless. Just like in the movie margin call, they need to make as much money as they can before the truth gets out."</em></p>

<p><strong>This ties in Nicely with the following section, DD</strong></p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Section 2 - DD</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fortifier22/"><strong>u/fortifier22</strong></a> <strong>Explains in his DD that:</strong></p>
<p><em>"Too much is going on right now in the financial world for it all NOT to be connected. And if Michael Bury and other financial experts are right, then the United States and other countries across the globe will soon be in a dire economic situation akin to the Great Depression.</em></p>
<p><em>The United States Economy is about to fail.</em></p>
<p><em>Trillions of dollars in the market are currently unaccounted for; especially the 40% of total US Liquidity that has been pumped into the economy as of May 2020. "</em></p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>This is not only backed up, but also exacerbated in</strong> u/atobitts <strong>DD</strong></p>
<p><em>"The DTC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned from a manual to a computerized ledger system in the 80s, and it played a significant role in the 1987 market crash. In 2003, several issuers with the DTC wanted to remove their securities from the DTC's deposit account because the DTC's participants were naked short selling their securities. Turns out, they were right. The DTC and it's participants have created a market-sized naked short selling scheme. All of this is made possible by the DTC's enrollee- Cede &amp; Co.</em></p>
<p><em>The events we are living through RIGHT NOW are the 50-year ripple effects of stock market evolution. From the birth of the DTC to the cesspool we currently find ourselves in, this DD will illustrate just how fragile the House of Cards has become.</em></p>
<p><em>We've been warned so many times... We've made the same mistakes so. many. times.</em> <em>"</em></p>

<p><strong>Another DD from</strong>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/missing_the_point_/"><strong>u/missing_the_point_</strong></a> <strong>states:</strong></p>
<p><em>"</em> <em>First of all, I’d like to start off by stating this post is completely nonpartisan. GME is not a political debate, it’s a class war.</em></p>
<p><em>Okay, let me ask you guys this — how many of you knew that when the pandemic began, the FED pumped $3 trillion dollars into the markets? I watch the news in the background all day, every day, and I didn’t know at the time when the injections were happening. This news would have been of great interest to me since I day trade, so it would not be something that I wasn’t paying attention to. I just simply wasn’t looking in the right places.</em></p>
<p><em>I honestly think GME is priceless, and the most valuable stock you will ever buy."</em></p>

<p>*"*<em>FTD Cycle adding to my theory</em></p>
<p><em>Apes, as I said yesterday, if this theory is correct (again don't take it as fact), then I will be making an autist level 4billion DD about my theory, where we are going, and some more goodies. But for now, here is some more information that I have gathered to backup my theory.</em></p>
<p><em>In yesterday's post</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/nuulss/"><em>u/nuulss</em></a> <em>made an excellent comment where he mentioned that tomorrow was 21 days after the march monthly options expire (the March option prediction/theory is from pixel). In his comment, this user called it T+21, which got me thinking ALOT. A few weeks/months ago I read a god-tier DD about the FTD squeeze. Sadly I couldn't find it. Apes, I shit you not when I say I scoured reddit for over an hour looking for this one fucking website and I found it. So please, please read this link because this is some of the best DD that I have ever seen in my life and you will definitely learn something from it."</em></p>

<p><strong>FTD's being 'reset' through borrowing ETFS According to</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/augrr/"><strong>u/augrr</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><em>"</em> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VhxsUkiMEdSFybr5E4jI0iARQ6urRvVYafjZe1uLly4/edit#gid=0"><em>In my FTD document</em></a><em>, I believe I have identified the smoking gun of how these shares have been borrowed and subsequently extended against. T+5+30 (T+35) FTD obligations of IWN created massive volume-upticks on the T+35 date. In my opinion, I have proven that ETFs were used to “reset” FTDs, but I am open for arguments against it.

<p><strong>Missing Bananas?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nayboyer2/"><strong>u/nayboyer2</strong></a> <strong>Posts :</strong></p>
<p><em>"While looking into this, I realized that the GME Bloomberg Terminal data is missing between 31.4% and 38.9% of GME daily trading volume from 4/13 - 4/20.</em></p>
<p><em>That's</em> <strong><em>19,411,389 missing bananas</em></strong> <em>over just 6 trading days. Only 70 million GME-issued bananas are supposed to exist...</em></p>
<p><em>If you add up the</em> <strong><em>total missing volume</em></strong> <em>+</em> <strong><em>ADF volume</em></strong>*, you will see that* <strong><em>over 69%</em></strong> <em>of GME bananas are being reported as trading off exchange (FINRA ADF, which is reportedly not in operation - again see my post from yesterday), or completely missing (a deeper, darker pool that even Bloomberg can't see?).</em></p>
<p><strong><em>40,126,778 GME bananas</em></strong> <em>were traded over 6 days, and even Bloomberg, which costs $24,000/year, has no idea where they are."</em></p>
