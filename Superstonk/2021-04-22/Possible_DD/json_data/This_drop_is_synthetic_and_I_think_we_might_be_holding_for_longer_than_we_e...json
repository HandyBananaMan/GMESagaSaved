    "selftext": "I have been taking some looks at the Level 2 information and it seems that when \"they\" want to drop the price, \"they\" use smaller lots of bids and asks - today was lots of 11 - 11 shares were being traded back and forth the entire time we saw a drop in the price down by $10. Other apes have noticed this before. See image 1.\n\n[IMAGE 1](https://preview.redd.it/8gusyrg3qru61.png?width=2805&format=png&auto=webp&s=453ebbfcddae1c074a635b3e8257da2d0e48d89e)\n\nI then noticed they stopped trading in these lots, see image 2 below. It went back to the \"normal\" lots of 100 shares each. I also happened to notice that yesterday (April 21st) \"they\" did not use this smaller lot tactic to lower the price, there were only these large lots of 100 basically. I think they may have thought sentiment had changed, maybe they saw a shift in our community and decided this would be the best time to make it drop and seem like people are selling\n\n[IMAGE 2](https://preview.redd.it/lw8nxayppru61.png?width=2833&format=png&auto=webp&s=238fc13b8da52796bc95c48ea8f0c602623e550f)\n\nI then noticed this sell wall go up. See image 3 1450, at 149. I think they are lowering the price, then trying to prevent it from going back up.\n\n[IMAGE 3](https://preview.redd.it/6t9im6yppru61.png?width=3011&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff2722813d5cf2c24fd84437b760c37a0ff04e71)\n\nI think they may have raised capital to prevent a margin call and potentially keep this whole charade going longer than they expect. They may be using DD against us that are promising dates to generate fatigue. I think we are in for a longer haul than we might expect here. Don't lose interest.\n\n~~They may be synthetically inflating some cryptocurrencies to prevent a margin call. Look at this shit:~~\n\n[~~https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/capital-x-cell/~~](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/capital-x-cell/)\n\nEdit: Weird I have never seen an instant downvote before, someone either troll/shill is instantly downvoting our posts.\n\nEdit 2: Check out this post on \"odd lots\":\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu8x6r/trader\\_using\\_odd\\_lots\\_to\\_avoid\\_detection\\_omitting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu8x6r/trader_using_odd_lots_to_avoid_detection_omitting/)\n\nSome more info on odd lots:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/odd-lot-trading-on-the-rise-4774753](https://www.investopedia.com/odd-lot-trading-on-the-rise-4774753)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119501231584492459](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119501231584492459)\n\nI am a bit too smooth brained to figure out exactly what they might be doing here.",
