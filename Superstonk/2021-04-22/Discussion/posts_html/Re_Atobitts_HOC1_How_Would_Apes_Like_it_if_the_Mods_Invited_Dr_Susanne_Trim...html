<p>After u/Atobitt amazing DD yesterday, 2 sources emerged that basically confirmed Atobitt's DD to be factually correct: The book "Naked, Short and Greedy" by Wall Street whistleblower <strong>Dr. Susanne Trimbath</strong> (Link here: <a href="https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy">https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy</a>), and the paper "The Rise and Effects of the Indirect Holding System" by law professor <strong>David C. Donald</strong> (Link here: <a href="https://www.ilf-frankfurt.de/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/ILF_WP_068.pdf">https://www.ilf-frankfurt.de/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/ILF_WP_068.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>I think these 2 very accomplished individuals know a lot about the evidently fraudulent financial market and <strong>apes would benefit greatly if we could invite these 2 for an AMA session in the future</strong>.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Equally important, what do mods think?</p>

<p>Edit: Credits to u/<img alt="LongTimeLurkTard" src="https://www.reddit.com/user/LongTimeLurkTard/" /> for reminding me: It is my intention that this AMA interview be solely about the broader macroeconomic environment and the inner workings of the DTCC and DTC. I don't assume that these two individuals have the most up to date info regarding GME, and I have no intention of creating another AMA disaster where hedgies have another seemingly legitamate reason to tank the stock.</p>
