After u/Atobitt amazing DD yesterday, 2 sources emerged that basically confirmed Atobitt's DD to be factually correct: The book "Naked, Short and Greedy" by Wall Street whistleblower **Dr. Susanne Trimbath** (Link here: [https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy](https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy)), and the paper "The Rise and Effects of the Indirect Holding System" by law professor **David C. Donald** (Link here: [https://www.ilf-frankfurt.de/fileadmin/\_migrated/content\_uploads/ILF\_WP\_068.pdf](https://www.ilf-frankfurt.de/fileadmin/_migrated/content_uploads/ILF_WP_068.pdf)).

I think these 2 very accomplished individuals know a lot about the evidently fraudulent financial market and **apes would benefit greatly if we could invite these 2 for an AMA session in the future**.

What do you guys think? Equally important, what do mods think?

Obligatory GME to the moon ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Edit: Credits to u/![LongTimeLurkTard](https://www.reddit.com/user/LongTimeLurkTard/) for reminding me: It is my intention that this AMA interview be solely about the broader macroeconomic environment and the inner workings of the DTCC and DTC. I don't assume that these two individuals have the most up to date info regarding GME, and I have no intention of creating another AMA disaster where hedgies have another seemingly legitamate reason to tank the stock.
