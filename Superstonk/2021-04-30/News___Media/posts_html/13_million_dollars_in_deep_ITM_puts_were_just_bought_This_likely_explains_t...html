<p>I've been watching options chain all day and someone just spent over 13 millions dollars in deep in the money puts ($300 puts expiring today). This probably explains the drop from 180 to 175. Hopefully we see a reversal of that trend in power hour!</p>
<p>1106 volume x 100 shares in a put x \~$123 cost = \~13.6 mil</p>
<p>Edit: by "just" I mean they were bought sometime in the past hour</p>
