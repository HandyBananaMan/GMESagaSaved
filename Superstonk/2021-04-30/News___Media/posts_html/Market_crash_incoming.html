<p>From the article:</p>
<p><strong>Data collected by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority shows that total margin debt across Wall Street hit $822bn by the end of March — <em>after</em> Archegos had failed.</strong> That was almost double the $479bn level of this time last year and far more than the around $400bn peak that margin debt reached in 2007, just before the financial crisis.
To put these numbers in context, ABP Invest, a London-based fund, calculates that <strong>during the 2000 dotcom and 2007 credit booms, US margin debt topped out at roughly 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Now it is nearly 4 per cent.</strong></p>
<p>Take this as what you will</p>
