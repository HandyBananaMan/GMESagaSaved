<p>First off, huge shout out to u/TheeHumanMeat for finding the article Dr. Trimbath mentioned using The Way Back Machine. Find his post here :</p>

<p>Now, if you are anything like me, you loaded that pdf and your eyes started to glaze over. I forced myself to read it in its entirety and am here to give you the ELIA because it really... really... matters.</p>

<p><strong>"One share does not always equal one vote in the crazy math of proxy contests. When short sellers borrow stock, investor democracy can be a sham."</strong></p>
<p>Did your alarm just go off? Are we FUK? No, we got this but you need to keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>"In a little-known quirk of Wall Street bookkeeping, when brokerages loan out a customer’s stock to short sellers and those traders sell the stock to someone else, both investors are often able to vote in corporate elections."</strong></p>
<p>I was under the ape assumption that shorters can not vote directly with the borrowed shares and this is technically true but when they sell the shares to a new broker, that broker now magically has shares that CAN VOTE.</p>

<p><strong>"In close contests with little room for error, the results of high-stakes company decisions may hinge on the invisible influence of millions of votes that shouldn’t be counted"</strong></p>
<p>Now, while GameStop is not voting on a radical decision like a merger or sale, we are electing Ryan Cohen as Chairman as well as electing/confirming other board members.</p>

<p>Jane Goodall over here cutting right to the heart of the matter. Brokerages are neutral parties looking out for #1. Why rock the boat when the passengers are sleeping?</p>
<p>The article gives some great historical examples of when and how this matters. Here are just a few. Its also important to note they do not need to be extreme discrepancies. With growing scrutiny on synthetic shares being used in proxy voting, economic terrorists only need to identify the sliver of winning margin required to push companies down the path they choose.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/dt9nd4x8x7w61.jpg?width=2004&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ac140480a12f5baffd32182ea6aa712b7555aa6</p>
<p>As we well know, short interest is mostly self reported. Because of this myself and others are pulling out their hair trying to figure out ways to determine how many synthetic shares exist or as I personally like to call it the pH(loat).</p>
<p><strong>"The only published figures that permit estimates of lending activity for any individual stock are contained in monthly short-interest disclosures by the NYSE, Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange. Those reports show how many of a company’s shares are out on loan to short sellers as of a single day in the middle of each month. Short-sale levels aren’t made public for other times, such as a record date."</strong></p>
<p>Here is where things can and will be different this time. This isn't 2014. The apes are watching, hell the world is watching. That said, not a single one of us can afford to be complacent.</p>
<p><strong>"The arrival of millions of duplicate ballots in a corporate election would be more obvious if not for one fact: In many elections, up to half of all stockholders don’t participate, leaving plenty of leeway for brokerages to permit voting of borrowed shares without going over the maximum number of eligible votes."</strong></p>
<p>Let me repeat that for emphasis</p>
<h1>"In many elections, up to half of all stockholders don’t participate"</h1>
<p>Let that sink in. We have a confirmation bias problem on this subreddit. I get it, I am an active participant. It's easy to sit back with our smooth brains, smash that buy button and think our mods and godlike DD authors will take care of everything but we NEED TO GROW WRINKLES.</p>
<p>You want a rise of the planet of the apes? It needs to begin with one simple word.</p>

<p>What now? What do?</p>
<p>You absolutely, 100% need to do everything in your power to vote.</p>
<p>I am talking to you US share holders that already have the ability but put it off because, "Hey there are hundreds of thousands of apes here I'm sure they got it covered"</p>
<p>I am talking to you Robinhood holders (god damnit you guys, seriously?) who got an email from them the other day and the vote looks a little fishy so you put it off.</p>
<p>I am talking to you PFOF, cashapp, webull, etoro wtfever else rando app holders that were told you cant vote because of blah blah blah. Email/Call customer service. Make a stink. It doesn't matter if you end up being able to or not. Apply pressure.</p>
<p>I am talking to you UK apes who think you cant vote because you aren't in the US.</p>

<p><strong>"One solution would be for Wall Street brokerages to clearly disclose who can and can’t vote in corporate elections. Until that happens, double and triple voting on one share will continue to make a mockery of shareholder democracy"</strong></p>
<p>Now I'm sitting here on my ass waiting for Fidelity to release proxy vote materials. Why is it taking so long? Maybe they are just old school. Maybe it's a complete shit-show. But maybe, just maybe they are working on the solution quoted above. Probably just a pipe dream I know but I can't help but hope.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> read the post its really importa... just kidding. VOTE. Not just because you want to help Papa Cohen potentially expose the short interest but because you believe in the direction he is taking the company and you don't want hedge fuckery to get in the way.  Vote like your future depends on it because it just might.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Did you make it all the way down to the bottom? Well done Ape! Now scroll back up and give u/TheeHumanMeat some love on his post. He deserves it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Getting a lot of questions about apes with "Portfolio Diversity" having shares at multiple brokerages. <strong>ABSOLUTELY VOTE WITH EACH BROKERAGE.</strong> They have no idea how many shares you have split between the platforms.</p>
