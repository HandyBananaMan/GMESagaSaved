    "selftext": "First off, huge shout out to u/TheeHumanMeat for finding the article Dr. Trimbath mentioned using The Way Back Machine. Find his post here :\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1hjb3/i\\_spent\\_3\\_hours\\_searching\\_for\\_the\\_bob\\_drummond/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1hjb3/i_spent_3_hours_searching_for_the_bob_drummond/)\n\nNow, if you are anything like me, you loaded that pdf and your eyes started to glaze over. I forced myself to read it in its entirety and am here to give you the ELIA because it really... really... matters.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jh8eo4x458w61.gif\n\n**\"One share does not always equal one vote in the crazy math of proxy contests. When short sellers borrow stock, investor democracy can be a sham.\"**\n\nDid your alarm just go off? Are we FUK? No, we got this but you need to keep reading.\n\n**\"In a little-known quirk of Wall Street bookkeeping, when brokerages loan out a customer\u2019s stock to short sellers and those traders sell the stock to someone else, both investors are often able to vote in corporate elections.\"**\n\nI was under the ape assumption that shorters can not vote directly with the borrowed shares and this is technically true but when they sell the shares to a new broker, that broker now magically has shares that CAN VOTE.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmtfysl9t7w61.jpg?width=2005&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4561031c6194b49c1797854a0534bfcf14470752\n\n**\"In close contests with little room for error, the results of high-stakes company decisions may hinge on the invisible influence of millions of votes that shouldn\u2019t be counted\"**\n\nNow, while GameStop is not voting on a radical decision like a merger or sale, we are electing Ryan Cohen as Chairman as well as electing/confirming other board members.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6ra3hnbv7w61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08975a5d9537759e5c8f86140daa7947e85cebcc\n\nJane Goodall over here cutting right to the heart of the matter. Brokerages are neutral parties looking out for #1. Why rock the boat when the passengers are sleeping?\n\nThe article gives some great historical examples of when and how this matters. Here are just a few. Its also important to note they do not need to be extreme discrepancies. With growing scrutiny on synthetic shares being used in proxy voting, economic terrorists only need to identify the sliver of winning margin required to push companies down the path they choose.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dt9nd4x8x7w61.jpg?width=2004&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ac140480a12f5baffd32182ea6aa712b7555aa6\n\nAs we well know, short interest is mostly self reported. Because of this myself and others are pulling out their hair trying to figure out ways to determine how many synthetic shares exist or as I personally like to call it the pH(loat).\n\n**\"The only published figures that permit estimates of lending activity for any individual stock are contained in monthly short-interest disclosures by the NYSE, Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange. Those reports show how many of a company\u2019s shares are out on loan to short sellers as of a single day in the middle of each month. Short-sale levels aren\u2019t made public for other times, such as a record date.\"**\n\nHere is where things can and will be different this time. This isn't 2014. The apes are watching, hell the world is watching. That said, not a single one of us can afford to be complacent.\n\n**\"The arrival of millions of duplicate ballots in a corporate election would be more obvious if not for one fact: In many elections, up to half of all stockholders don\u2019t participate, leaving plenty of leeway for brokerages to permit voting of borrowed shares without going over the maximum number of eligible votes.\"**\n\nLet me repeat that for emphasis\n\n# \"In many elections, up to half of all stockholders don\u2019t participate\"\n\nLet that sink in. We have a confirmation bias problem on this subreddit. I get it, I am an active participant. It's easy to sit back with our smooth brains, smash that buy button and think our mods and godlike DD authors will take care of everything but we NEED TO GROW WRINKLES.\n\nYou want a rise of the planet of the apes? It needs to begin with one simple word.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8b5m89k018w61.gif\n\nWhat now? What do?\n\nYou absolutely, 100% need to do everything in your power to vote.\n\nI am talking to you US share holders that already have the ability but put it off because, \"Hey there are hundreds of thousands of apes here I'm sure they got it covered\"\n\nI am talking to you Robinhood holders (god damnit you guys, seriously?) who got an email from them the other day and the vote looks a little fishy so you put it off.\n\nI am talking to you PFOF, cashapp, webull, etoro wtfever else rando app holders that were told you cant vote because of blah blah blah. Email/Call customer service. Make a stink. It doesn't matter if you end up being able to or not. Apply pressure.\n\nI am talking to you UK apes who think you cant vote because you aren't in the US.\n\n# List of brokers currently allowing proxy vote with instructions how to do so\n\n[How to vote with Questrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxucpw/how_canadians_using_questrade_can_vote/)\n\n[How to vote with iWeb](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1qkw3/uk_apes_iweb_allows_voting_you_have_to_get_in/)\n\n[How to vote with DeGiro](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwz1ro/how_to_vote_with_degiro/)\n\n[How to vote with SwissQuote](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwzcnr/how_to_vote_for_swissquote_users/)\n\n[How to vote with Revolut](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxl3kk/how_to_vote_for_revolut_apes/)\n\n[How to vote with TD Ameritrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwyxwk/boredom_is_killing_me_so_i_decided_to_find_out/)\n\n[How to vote with WealthSimple](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzg4s0/wealthsimple_shareholder_voting_howto_for/)\n\n[How to vote with CommSec](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mzc5pz/how_to_proxy_vote_gme_trading_with_commsec/)\n\n[How to vote with Robinhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n0s1r0/how_to_vote_with_robinhood_a_picture_book_for/)\n\n[How to vote with Hargreaves Lansdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnfg5y/how_to_vote_for_uk_on_hl/) (This may not be accurate - [See follow Up](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwpqdf/europoors_what_needs_to_be_done_to_be_able_to/) )\n\n[How to vote with E Trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwya8d/etrade_get_your_control_number_call_or_live_chat/)\n\n[How to vote with Cash App](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxywc9/cash_app_sent_out_proxy_vote_info_just_got_an/)\n\n[How to vote with Schwab](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1qhtb/how_synthetic_shares_can_destroy_proxy_voting/gwf4iec?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[How to vote with Merrill Edge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx66fe/proxy_voting_instructions_for_apes_on_merrill_edge/)\n\n**\"One solution would be for Wall Street brokerages to clearly disclose who can and can\u2019t vote in corporate elections.
