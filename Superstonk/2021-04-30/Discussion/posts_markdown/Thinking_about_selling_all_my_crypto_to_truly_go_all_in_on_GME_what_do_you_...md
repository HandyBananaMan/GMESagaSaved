I've been investing in crypto since like September, started with $2500 and it's worth like $8700 right now. I could get 50 more shares of GME on Monday, what do you apes think? 

I'd like to hear some honest responses from you guys and get some discussions going. If I decide to do it, I'll make a follow up post for you apes as soon as I buy more.
