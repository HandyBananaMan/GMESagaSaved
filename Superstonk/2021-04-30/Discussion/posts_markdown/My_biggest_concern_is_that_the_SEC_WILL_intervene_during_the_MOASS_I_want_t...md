I'm seeing a sudden spike in posts trying to push for the SEC to intervene. This is pretty sus to me. First of all, flooding the sub with a unified talking point is the playbook that shills use as part of their propaganda strategy. We've seen it before from topics ranging from pump and dumps with silver and other stocks, to when they try to foment divisiveness based on popular users, to stupid shit like trying to scare us with taxes. The shills, HFs, and whatever PR firm they might have hired are so obvious with their message bombing campaigns that any time I see an unnatural rise in one particular topic I am sus of the intent of that messaging.

Secondly, this push to try to force the SEC's hand, through hashtagging or whatever, has the same tone of urgency that shills also employ. It reminds me of the "must act now" posts to bombard the SEC with comments regarding proposed rule changes that only acted to delay the review of those rules. This campaign seems the same in that it is urgently pushing apes to act regarding something that they really don't know a lot about with unforeseen consequences.

And what are those unforeseen consequences? Well, what do you think would happen if the SEC did intervene? I fear that it would result in a halting of the MOASS that would not benefit retail investors.

I've done research on historical short squeezes, runs on the market and market crashes. In the overwhelming amount of cases, short squeezes and runs on the market, even to the extent that the market crashed, were allowed to play out without government or regulatory intervention. Action only came after the fact and usually resulted in efforts to increase funds to cover the obligations and debts from the squeeze or market crash.

In other words, the free market was allowed to operate and prevail. That is what retail investors want in the case of a MOASS. The Shorts need to pay the price for their actions and that price needs to be determined by the market price that the holders of the stock dictate.

Take a look at this FINRA page describing market interventions through history: [https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/cushion-crash-market-interventions-through-history](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/cushion-crash-market-interventions-through-history)

Time and time again, the market has not been interfered with and short squeezes and even market crashes have been allowed to play out with intervention only coming after the fact.

In March of 2020 the NYSE experienced it's greatest single day loss in history. The market was allowed to play out and intervention came after the fact in the form of COVID relief bills.

In 2015 KBIO was short squeezed resulting in the stock price increasing by 10,000% in 5 days. Again there was no intervention and the squeeze was allowed to play out.

In 2008 the VW short squeeze resulted in that stock becoming the most valued stock in the market within 4 days. There was no intervention to prevent that.

Also in 2008, the mortgage CDO and housing crisis caused the market to crash and powerful hedgefunds, like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, to go bankrupt. Even that big crash was allowed to happen. Intervention only came after the fact through the TARP relief fund and money bail outs for banks that were notoriously "too big to fail."

Even going back to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which was so catastrophic that it likely was a big contributor to the Great Depression (among other important factors), it was allowed to occur and play out with intervention only coming after the fact in the form of banks (and not government) buyouts of big chunks of shares (as described in the FINRA link above).

There are other examples of short squeezes, runs on the market and even market crashes that were allowed to play out without government or regulatory intervention, both in the US and markets abroad, that I will not cover because this post is already too long. But allowing the free market to play out is definitely the norm and not the exception.

In fact, the only case I could find of intervention was during the LTCM crisis in 1998 when the Fed Reserve Bank of NY and most of the major HFs worked out a negotiated settlement price. And guess what? That intervention was not good for the investors of LTCM at all.

So no, we don't want the fuckin SEC or any other body to intervene during the MOASS! We want it to be allowed to be played out based on the free market!

Finally, these calls to urgently act in some way to force the SEC to intervene are not only sus but ignores the fact that actions are already being undertaken that do indeed seem to favor retail investors and the free market. JUST BUY, HODL, AND WAIT!

The new DTCC, DTC, OTCC, and NSCC rules are already in motion and highly suggest that the market is preparing for the MOASS to occur. So no "urgent" intervention is needed nor wanted. The rules are already changing and the MOASS needs to be allowed to be resolved via the free market so proper tendies will be given. I know apes may be impatient but check out this good DD regarding the upper time limit for the new rules to be in place and how they will benefit retail investors and the MOASS result: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n21ml0/amc\_and\_gme\_why\_share\_price\_doesnt\_matter\_right/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n21ml0/amc_and_gme_why_share_price_doesnt_matter_right/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So who would benefit from the SEC intervening during the MOASS? The Shorts. The HFs. I think it's their last ditch effort to try to squirm out of paying what apes are going to force them to pay.

Don't listen to the latest shill campaign to force the SEC to intervene. Don't listen to their played out tactics or false urgency and emergency. Let the free market handle this situation like the American free market should. That's how apes get all the bananas owed to them.

I know this post will get downvoted to hell by all the shills and their thousands of fake accounts. I also know they will try to engage me with dumb ass obfuscating misinformation questions in the comments. Fuck you shills, I said what I needed to say.
