<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I am not paid by anyone, for anything, other than my day job which has been taking up ALL of my time lately. So before anyone calls me out, I am writing this post because I want to- not because I'm being paid. Superstonk will never be monetized. period.</strong></p>

<p>One of my biggest concerns is the involvement with our communities on CNBC, FOX and other MSM outlets. I've said this before and I'll say it again: I will never do an interview with those networks unless THEY come to us. When you're interviewing live on their platform, you're often unaware of what the "headline" is saying on your screen. You literally can't see what they're saying about you. Several people will take that "headline" as the "highlight" of the interview, when it's often taken out of context and misleading. Furthermore, they're able to edit and replay those "highlights" throughout the day after the guest has left.</p>
<p>This LITERALLY happened to me and I wasn't even on the program. When the Mulligan brothers (whom I know personally and have been working with; they're great dudes u/albanak) went onto FOX Business, FOX played the trailer to their documentary before greeting them. In the trailer, I am on record saying <em>"there are more shares floating around than the company had originally issued".</em> This points to the true narrative we are trying to address- MARKET MANIPULATION. In fact, the majority of their trailer addresses this fact. The trailer then ends and the Mulligan brothers are greeted by Charles Payne. The narrative throughout the interview then shifts and focuses on how people are suffering from poverty and had almost NOTHING to do with naked short selling. Afterward, FOX posted the interview on their YouTube channel and edited the trailer out of the video. They only showed the parts of the trailer that fit their narrative. </p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://youtu.be/ATyHO2mMmfo?t=738">first version</a> that I found on some dude's livestream. the link starts at 12:18 which marks the beginning of the trailer. </p>
<p>Now, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C73MBeMhfeE">edited clip</a> from Fox Business that cut out THEIR story and focused entirely on the poor, poor, retail investor just trying to get by in life.</p>
<p>Same thing happened to Trey Collins from Trey's Trades. I can't speak a bad word about Trey because he's been fighting for this cause since the very beginning. He also fell victim to the MSM's "headline" which suggested he was <em>enlisting an army of apes.</em> I guarantee you, Trey had NO idea this was being shown while he was talking. I immediately tried to clarify this in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0jdeh/important_we_are_not_enlisting_anyone_saying_sht/">post</a> because that's the same type of sh*t that will start circulating and end up as evidence of market manipulation.   </p>

<p>This is why I ONLY do livestreams that are controlled by APES: you can talk about the topics as they come to mind, without being confined to a narrative. With that being said, I decided to jump on AndrewMoMoney's channel earlier today (here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4VH7kVyc28">video</a>) but his internet kept cutting out, so I'll be going back on tomorrow @ market open to discuss more about the shifting narrative on MSM. Andrew is a friend of mine and we talk frequently offline. This is an issue he has also wanted to bring attention to and it's a very good opportunity for both of us to do so.</p>
<p>In addition, I'll be throwing out some opinions on a few interesting posts that have come up in the r/Superstonk community, such as: </p>
<ol>
<li>RRP &amp; potential connections with share lending</li>
<li>Issues with Reddit</li>
<li>Inflation</li>
<li>Availability of information to retail investors</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the sub has reached almost 500k members (F*CK yeah), it's important for us to rehash these concepts that are frequently forgotten.</p>
