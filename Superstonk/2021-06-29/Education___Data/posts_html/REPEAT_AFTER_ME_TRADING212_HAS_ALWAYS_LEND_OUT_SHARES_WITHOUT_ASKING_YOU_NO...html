<p>Nothing has changed, nothing is going on, they have made OTHER changes to the terms.</p>
<p>If you are on Trading212 then your shares have been lent out from the beginning, they were never truly yours and you have agreed to this when you opened the account.</p>
<p>This is how they keep trading commission free, ask them and they will confirm this !!!!!</p>
<p><strong>I got out of T212 and diversified my broker accounts, you make your own choices.</strong></p>
<p>This is not financial advice.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Check the date on my previous post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnl0xz/message_your_broker_today/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnl0xz/message_your_broker_today/</a></p>
<p>I asked for my shares to be recalled so I can use them to vote and they refused. </p>
<p><strong>SHARES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LENT OUT !!!</strong></p>
