<h1>Title: Volume looks to be closing under 2.5m today. The last time we had volume this low was May 20 (vol. 2.5m), the day before our 13 day run from $170 - $344. Prior to that, the low was on May 12 (vol. 2.7m) and we saw a subsequent four day run from $145 - $189. No expectations but my titties are jacked!</h1>
