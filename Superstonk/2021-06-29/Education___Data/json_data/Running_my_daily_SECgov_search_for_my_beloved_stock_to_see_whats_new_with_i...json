They have more shares on loan than they hold.](https://preview.redd.it/il9sn9rw87871.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=13c3dbd0b919843d2446abc97a51fc79bacd3b14)\n\nNow, we really need an adult here! Did these guys just filed with the SEC that they loaned more shares than they own?\n\nThen I went through the YTD data dump (one of the tabs in the doc) and there are cases where this happens but the differences are pretty small and might come from how the value on loan is calculated. As they don't disclose the number of shares on loan, I'm using this formula:\n\n    sharesOnLoan = valueOnLoan/(usdValue/sharesHeld)\n\nIt worked so far, even for their previous fillings it worked.. could be an reporting error or the data is good but we need an adult.\n\n\\---\n\nDo what you want with this info, could be nothing, could be good DD starting point for more wrinkled brain apes, I just like to search [SEC.gov](https://sec.gov/) and this is no kind of advice, this is written on the SEC website.\n\nWill look out for new updates throughout the day and update.\n\nObligatory: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Edit:** Updated the data dump with a column of GME weight in the fund (percent) because I found it interestingly enough that for the two investco funds with bad data, the holdings are quite unusual (8% and 6%)\n\n**Edit2:** Did a little rabbit hole digging. This is the first filling URL: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001209466/000175272421142046/0001752724-21-142046-index.html](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001209466/000175272421142046/0001752724-21-142046-index.html) \n\nWe have a ticker there, XSVM. good.\n\nSo follow the CIK:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=S000003025](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=S000003025)\n\nCheck previous fillings. GME is in there correctly reported and in different percentages...\n\nSearch [etf.com](https://etf.com): [https://www.etf.com/XSVM#overview](https://www.etf.com/XSVM#overview) No mention on the GME position.\n\nOfficial website: [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/holdings?audienceType=Institutional&ticker=XSVM](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/holdings?audienceType=Institutional&ticker=XSVM) No Mention on the GME position\n\nChecked the web archive.
