Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.19230013. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.\n\n~~Today I am testing an alternate method of fetching data, using quote data from Yahoo Finance APIs to calculate an average of 7 German exchanges and volume. Those results will be posted in the comment section.~~\n\nMany among the Diamantenh\u00e4nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Over the weekend, DerGurkenraspler appears to have deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
