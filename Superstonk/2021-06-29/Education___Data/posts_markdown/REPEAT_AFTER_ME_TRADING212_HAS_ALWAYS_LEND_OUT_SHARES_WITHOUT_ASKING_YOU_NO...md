Nothing has changed, nothing is going on, they have made OTHER changes to the terms.

If you are on Trading212 then your shares have been lent out from the beginning, they were never truly yours and you have agreed to this when you opened the account.

This is how they keep trading commission free, ask them and they will confirm this !!!!!

**I got out of T212 and diversified my broker accounts, you make your own choices.**

This is not financial advice.

**EDIT:** Check the date on my previous post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnl0xz/message\_your\_broker\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnl0xz/message_your_broker_today/)

I asked for my shares to be recalled so I can use them to vote and they refused. 

**SHARES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LENT OUT !!!**
