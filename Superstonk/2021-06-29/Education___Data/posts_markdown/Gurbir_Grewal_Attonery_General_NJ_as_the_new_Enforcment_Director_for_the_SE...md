Gurbir Grewal, Attonery General (N.J) will be the new Enforcment Director for the SEC. 

Gary Genslers mouth : *" He has had a distinguished career as New Jersey's chief law enforcement  officer and as a prosecutor at both the local and federal levels. He has  the ideal combination of experience, values, and leadership ability to  helm the Enforcement Division at this critical time. I look forward to  working closely with him to protect investors and root out wrongdoing in  our markets."* 

Hadn't heard of this chap before so I did a little digging. This is not a DD, just some easily gained information passed on to you, hairy, banana eating beauties.

# Grewals C.V. and some past exploits

(*Caveat: This is pretty much a copy paste job because it's late and I need sleep.*)

&#x200B;

*  Grewal worked as an assistant U.S. attorney (**AUSA**) in the Criminal  Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the district of New Jersey  from 2010 to 2016, while working as (**AUSA**) ... 
* He was the lead prosecutor in United States v. Drinkman, the  largest known data breach prosecution in which the conspirators   participated in a worldwide scheme that targeted major corporate  networks and  stole more than 160 million credit card numbers, causing  hundreds of millions  of dollars in losses. 
* He was also the lead  prosecutor in United States v.  Weinstein, a $200 million Ponzi  scheme in which the lead defendant was  sentenced to 24 years’  imprisonment.  
* While at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, he served as  chief of the Economic Crimes Unit from 2014 to 2016 and oversaw the  investigation and prosecution of all major white collar and cybercrimes  in the district of New Jersey. 
* He also worked in private practice at **Howrey LLP** (now dissolved);  Howrey was a global law firm that practiced antitrust, global litigation and intellectual property law. He personally conselled clients on a range of matters  including **securities (***nice***)**, trademark, antitrust and Foreign Corrupt Practices  Act issues; represented individuals and companies in government  investigations and criminal proceedings; conducted internal  investigations for public corporations; and conducted civil trials. 
* Although I haven't thoroughly investigated, its claimed that "Howrey provided over 45,000 hours of free legal assistance to more than 250 *pro bono* clients. " - Maybe quite an encouraging sign (i.e. moral backbone).
*   Gurbir Grewal announced the dismantling of an organized crime gambling and loansharking operation and also launched an investigation into prior corporate tax loopholes afforded the by New Jersey's Development Authority. 
*   Grewal joined state attorneys general from across the country in filing a lawsuit against 20 generic pharmaceuticals companies, 11 of which were based in New Jersey, along with several individuals, accusing them of collusion and price-fixing.
* On May 14, 2019, Grewal announced a lawsuit against several large chemical companies, accusing them of selling toxic firefighting foam for decades while knowing the health risks they posed to the public and to the environment.

Among other things, he's fought for stronger gun control, change police protocol and training to assess mental health while on the beat, abolished mandatory minimums for non-violent drug offenses, forced corrupt officials out of office and a load of other positive things.

He comes across (on paper at least), as genuine. I think this is good for ze stonks.
