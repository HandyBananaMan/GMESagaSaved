Please read u/Carb0n12 comment about NSCC 005 below. The extension for NSCC 005 will be filed tomorrow. Its not fully in effect until August 12th with no objection. This is the required fund deposit for membership fees. Not necessarily needed pre MOASS. 

And here is a video by Charlie who clears up when the rule is effective. The Federal Register is the final stage  https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/oaea7z/dtc005_confusion_explained/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

DTC 005 is our bae.

Here is a old post for brief description on each rule that has been put through since January. Its not up to date.... Yet.

The federal register is the last stage for these new rules. The DTC, OTC, NSCC can apply these rules before they go on the federal register. Did they? No,  they did not.  All these rules were put in place so retail never has this chance again. its so these fuckfaces can cover their own asses.

I gotta say i am seriously sick of the blatant crime and bullshit that goes on within the markets.  Kenny Mayo will feel the aftershock when i smash that sell button at XX milly a share. And leave the rest in the infinity pool.
