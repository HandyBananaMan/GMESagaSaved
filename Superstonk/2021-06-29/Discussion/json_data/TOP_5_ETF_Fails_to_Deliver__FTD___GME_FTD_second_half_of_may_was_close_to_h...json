    "selftext": "Greetings, I have collected some data:\n\n62 ETF that hold GME with the top 5:\n\n[https://www.etf.com/stock/GME](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSEC Fails to Deliver data MAY 2021 second half:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here is the data of the FTD in the top 5 GME ETF holders and GME stock itself. I would have like to do it with the 62 ETF but i lack the knowledge to do it automatically (yes, that was done in excel by hand, calculator and nearly a typewritter lol).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Second half MAY GME FTD](https://preview.redd.it/s8vdia1bc6871.jpg?width=1375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52f4e073303cbcf4aca5b6c5c2e06055ce56a00d)\n\nSo, as we can see, nearly half million shares FTD just from those top 5 ETF. I expect some more where also FTD in the other ETFs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, what it is relevant about this are the XRT dates with huge FTD from 21st to 26th of May. Also, the GME stock sees a relevant increase in FTD in those same days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that rises some questions that unfortunately my lack of knowledge can't answer:\n\nWill those dates lead us to some lock and forced buy in T+21+6 from those dates? Maybe, I really don't know, but if that is true, then approximately:\n\n21 May T+21+6 is 28 June (we saw a nice jump at market open)\n\n24,25,26 May leads to 29th, 30th June and 1st July.\n\n**EDIT: If instead of T+21 we follow the T+35 calendar days, the FTD settlement will be:**\n\n**26 June (saturday) --> 28, 28 (again from 24th May), 29 & 30 June.**\n\nWill it create an increase in price pressure and put us on a Gamma ramp on Friday 2nd? Lets see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n****SECOND EDIT: A comment from hippickles :\n\n\"Fails to deliver on a given day are a cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day. The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails. Thus, it is important to note that the age of fails cannot be determined by looking at these numbers.\"\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n\nSo maybe all my post is wrong\n\n\nBuy & hodl!!",
