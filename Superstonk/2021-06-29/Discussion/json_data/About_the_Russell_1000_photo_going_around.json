    "selftext": "It\u2019s misinformation at best, unethical at worst, and FUD nonetheless. I don\u2019t think OP was aware of the misinformation they were spreading. It\u2019s up to ALL us apes to catch these things before it circulates, like the post did. Let\u2019s begin.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis post is all thanks to /u/PsiGhost, who originally commented here. Made it into a post for visibility. This is also the original post of the red barcode-style image. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9qeq7/russell_1000_1_min_chart_wtf_is_this_i_have_never/h3d72nn/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSo, by now, you\u2019ve been searching all day on /r/Superstonk for some fresh memes, speculation, or DD to confirm your bias. You know, the usual. \n\nOf course, you saw the \u201cWTF\u201d post about the Russell 1000 (RUI) indicating irregular behavior, that much looks like a murder scene or a red barcode. You may have even gone deeper: when did this start? Does it correlate with GME? T+# dates? Banks and RRP? \n\nWell, I hope you didn\u2019t spend too much time dawning on that murder scene, as it is misleading and misinformative (again, thanks to /u/PsiGhost for pointing this out in the original post). \n\nThe picture you saw was of the [CFD](https://i.imgur.com/ArZmpUB); not RUI itself. As you can see, there is the true Russell 1000 index (2nd result) and the RUI CFD (shown in the original post with nearly 9k upvotes) is the first result.\n\nFor those that don\u2019t know (like me), CFD\u2019s aren\u2019t assets to be owned, and are actually trading instruments; OTC derivative contracts traded, using margin, based on the current spot price. There are some key differences between stocks and CFDs that\u2019s easily found and explained on G oogle. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSo, yeah, long post to basically say /r/Superstonk got **bamboozled**, most likely unintentionally by OP. Keep your heads up, and your tits jacked. It\u2019s no time for bullshit and apes must be analytical, logical, and diligent about speculative posts. If we all just eat up pictures and data without verifying the info ourselves, how does any smooth-brain expect to survive MOASS? \n\nThe true Russell 1000 index is looking fairly normal on WeBull 1min (credit to /u/PsiGhost again for this find and link) https://imgur.com/a/2Idru5W. Edit 2: by normal, i mean it doesn\u2019t look like a giant murder scene on the chart\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**TL;DR**: Russell 1000 (RUI index, not CFD) looks fairly normal. The OP that posted the \u201cWTF\u201d post with red barcode all over the screen, like someone was stabbed, likely was unaware that was the wrong ticker. \n\n~~This post is **NOT** meant to bash OP or anything. But, it\u2019s frustrating (and frankly cringe) to see a lot of /r/Superstonk gobble up and spread misinformation like wildfire.~~ this comment may have been a bit too frank and rash. Apologies. \n\nI mean, seriously, I felt like this post was needed because /u/PsiGhost\u2019s comment was going to get seriously buried in the weird variety of panicking and fearmongering comments in posts about RUI CFD.",
