I found out I can't move stocks to a different broker or stop share lending.\n\nI have since opened an ISA with a different broker to increase my position. Unfortunately this is currently the only option until we get some legal eagles to fight on our side. \n\n**If it sounds urgent and incites panic it's FUD.**\n\nLove you all - don't do anything rash.\n\nEdit: I'm not going to recommend a broker but I hear fidelity is good.",
