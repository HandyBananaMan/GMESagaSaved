I'm an ape more retarded than the others. I have a T212 Invest account.

It was my first. I found out I can't move stocks to a different broker or stop share lending.

I have since opened an ISA with a different broker to increase my position. Unfortunately this is currently the only option until we get some legal eagles to fight on our side. 

**If it sounds urgent and incites panic it's FUD.**

Love you all - don't do anything rash.

Edit: I'm not going to recommend a broker but I hear fidelity is good.
