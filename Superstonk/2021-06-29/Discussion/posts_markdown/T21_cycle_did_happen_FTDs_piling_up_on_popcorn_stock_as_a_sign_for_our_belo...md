Europoor here bored in the morning until pre-market opens. 

ONCE again props to u/criand ! He brought me the idea and then I found his comments to even expand my idea with all of his wrinkles.

TLDR: T+21 theory might hold when shorts decided not to deliver cause of 005 in place? Furthermore this would cause a forced delivery by T+4 or T+6. Popcorn stock getting on threshold list could be an indicator for GME. DANG! Edited criands thoughts about this! Probs go to him!

I was sliding through my Reddit feed when I noticed some interesting posts.

One was about popcorn stock entering threshold list on the NYSE. This seems to be the case when FTDs pile up too heavily on multiple consecutive days. Might this be a sign for GME aswell? Will we enter the threshold list aswell very soon? Maybe. Only time will show.

Then I read a comment of u/criand in which he explained that FTDs coming from short-marked shorts have to be satisfied within T+4 days. When I recall it correctly the T+21 day was on Thursday (last week) which brings this Wednesday as the T+4 for possible FTDs out of our T+21 cycle (30th June.. hm.. doomsday triggered by forced deliveries from T+21 and T+4?!)


Master mind u\criand also said that this time period for long-marked FTDs is T+6 what would be Friday this week.

Then I thought: 
Why now? Why did our T+21 Theory pop just now? 
Maybe a rule which came into effect over the last weeks changed something (005 is that you?!) and shorts decided not to deliver on T+21?!

I donâ€™t exactly know what is happening and if I got it all right. As I said I am bored and waiting for pre-market to open. But I wanted to post some of my thoughts and maybe someone can pick them up and develop them further?!

Please correct me if I am wrong. I will Edit my sources if this thing gains traction. Since I am on my phone, this would be a major pain lol.

Not financial advice.

Edit: Damn! I was searching for Criands comments to put them here and what I found was even better than the initial comment I saw of him!!
