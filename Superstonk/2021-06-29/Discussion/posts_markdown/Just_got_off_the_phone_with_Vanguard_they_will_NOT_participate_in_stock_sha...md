TL:DR: updated list of brokers that *do not* lend shares.

I'm transferring to Vanguard and called them. 45 minute wait for a call back but whatever. I asked them LOTS of questions, namely, will they ever lend shares out. The answer was something like this: We are one of the few trading platforms that will not participate in stock share lending, ever. Your stocks are your stocks.

I'll take them at their word and I'm initiating my transfer. Now my question tomorrow to Webull when I call during business hours, will be the same thing. Will they ever lend out shares. I will post back if anyone is interested.

I'll sleep better tonight knowing my stonks are safe. For now.
