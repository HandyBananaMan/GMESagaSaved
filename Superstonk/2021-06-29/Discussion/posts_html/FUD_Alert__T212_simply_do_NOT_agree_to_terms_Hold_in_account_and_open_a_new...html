<p>I'm an ape more retarded than the others. I have a T212 Invest account.</p>
<p>It was my first. I found out I can't move stocks to a different broker or stop share lending.</p>
<p>I have since opened an ISA with a different broker to increase my position. Unfortunately this is currently the only option until we get some legal eagles to fight on our side. </p>
<p><strong>If it sounds urgent and incites panic it's FUD.</strong></p>
<p>Love you all - don't do anything rash.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not going to recommend a broker but I hear fidelity is good.</p>
