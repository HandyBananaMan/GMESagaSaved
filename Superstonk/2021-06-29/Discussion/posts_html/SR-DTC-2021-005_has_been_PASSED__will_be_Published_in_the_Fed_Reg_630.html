<p>Yes here it is folks.  Don't expect an overnight change.  This is just another nail in their coffin.</p>
<p>This is NOT HYPE, just sharing the DD.  Go verify for yourself and come up with your own conclusion as to what it means to you.</p>

<p>For those who forgot what 005 is for:</p>
<p>TL;Dr - Stonks are supposed to be marked with a special tag that shows them as being "currently in use" thru a transaction.  That stonk can't be lent out (rehypothecated) again until the transaction is complete and the shares are returned, thus releasing the special "tag".  Bascially this is supposed to drastically slow down the HF's ability to naked short, create FTDs, &amp; eventually the creation of an illegal synthetic share.  Is it 100% foolproof?  Of course not, but it will slow them down and every little thing helps. </p>
