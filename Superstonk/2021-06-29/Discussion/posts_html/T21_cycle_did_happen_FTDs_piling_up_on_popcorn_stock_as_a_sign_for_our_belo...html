<p>Europoor here bored in the morning until pre-market opens. </p>
<p>ONCE again props to u/criand ! He brought me the idea and then I found his comments to even expand my idea with all of his wrinkles.</p>
<p>TLDR: T+21 theory might hold when shorts decided not to deliver cause of 005 in place? Furthermore this would cause a forced delivery by T+4 or T+6. Popcorn stock getting on threshold list could be an indicator for GME. DANG! Edited criands thoughts about this! Probs go to him!</p>
<p>I was sliding through my Reddit feed when I noticed some interesting posts.</p>
<p>One was about popcorn stock entering threshold list on the NYSE. This seems to be the case when FTDs pile up too heavily on multiple consecutive days. Might this be a sign for GME aswell? Will we enter the threshold list aswell very soon? Maybe. Only time will show.</p>
<p>Then I read a comment of u/criand in which he explained that FTDs coming from short-marked shorts have to be satisfied within T+4 days. When I recall it correctly the T+21 day was on Thursday (last week) which brings this Wednesday as the T+4 for possible FTDs out of our T+21 cycle (30th June.. hm.. doomsday triggered by forced deliveries from T+21 and T+4?!)</p>
<p>Master mind u\criand also said that this time period for long-marked FTDs is T+6 what would be Friday this week.</p>
<p>Then I thought: 
Why now? Why did our T+21 Theory pop just now? 
Maybe a rule which came into effect over the last weeks changed something (005 is that you?!) and shorts decided not to deliver on T+21?!</p>
<p>I donâ€™t exactly know what is happening and if I got it all right. As I said I am bored and waiting for pre-market to open. But I wanted to post some of my thoughts and maybe someone can pick them up and develop them further?!</p>
<p>Please correct me if I am wrong. I will Edit my sources if this thing gains traction. Since I am on my phone, this would be a major pain lol.</p>
<p>Not financial advice.</p>
<p>Edit: Damn! I was searching for Criands comments to put them here and what I found was even better than the initial comment I saw of him!! </p>
