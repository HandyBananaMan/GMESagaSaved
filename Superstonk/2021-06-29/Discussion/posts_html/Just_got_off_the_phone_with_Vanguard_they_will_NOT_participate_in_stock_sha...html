<p>I'm transferring to Vanguard and called them. 45 minute wait for a call back but whatever. I asked them LOTS of questions, namely, will they ever lend shares out. The answer was something like this: We are one of the few trading platforms that will not participate in stock share lending, ever. Your stocks are your stocks.</p>
<p>I'll take them at their word and I'm initiating my transfer. Now my question tomorrow to Webull when I call during business hours, will be the same thing. Will they ever lend out shares. I will post back if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>I'll sleep better tonight knowing my stonks are safe. For now.</p>
