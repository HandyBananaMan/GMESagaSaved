<p><strong>TL:DR - Regardless of this list, you need to double check with your broker. The settings/options may have these setting but in some cases you <em>may</em> need to call in order to opt out of share lending. Please make sure you check and double check.</strong></p>
<p>These are confirmed brokers/platforms as of today (7/2) that have confirmed they will not be offering share lending. Whether you are on a margin account or cash account, you still need to double check to opt IN or OUT. Also, remember to check your settings/options for the ability to turn <em>OFF</em> margin and switch to a cash account. This can help in a lot of cases. Please help add to this list as we go.</p>
<p>These will be added by those that have verified by phone, chat or email. If there is contradictory information, please post so we can rectify it immediately. Thank you all for helping.</p>

<p>Edit: Added reminder to turn off margin in settings/options. Also reminder let's have verified info by phone, email or chat so we're accurate for everyone to benefit from.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Alphabetized the list. Sorry for being lazy.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Blown away by the downvotes. If I worked for a HF, guess I wouldn't want people knowing who doesn't share lend either. ü¶çüçå</p>
<p>Edit 4: eToro said they will not participate in share lending but if they decide later on, there is no way to opt out.</p>
