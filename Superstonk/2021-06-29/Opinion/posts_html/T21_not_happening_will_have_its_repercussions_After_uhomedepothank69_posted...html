<p>Did ally'all read the DD since the dawn of time and see the signs and the ragtag team of wrinkly-brained quants gathered to help hank prove or disprove the FTD cycle theory? </p>
<p>Well I reckon that he proved it, and the fuckers decided to break the law yet again to try and disprove it. I reckon that the cost of hiding this recent FTD cycle to make it look like sideways trading has cost far more than is currently apparent. </p>
<p>I believe that there have been phone calls and deals buying a few more days while they try to break sentiment and undo the correct summations from hank's and atobitts and criand's research. </p>
<p>The castle did not expect all the serfs to pick the right lotto numbers - ever - and now they're trying to change the rules stop the gold from going to the villagers while at the same time avoiding a revolt.</p>
