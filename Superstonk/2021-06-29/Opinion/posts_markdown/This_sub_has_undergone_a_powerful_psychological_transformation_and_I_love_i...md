Have we all realized that? You don’t have explain what folk could perceive as loosely related facts. The data is so profound that one can simply reply short it then, if you’re so confident I’m wrong. 

February me:

I’m a tin-foil hat wearing crackpot that keeps mumbling about market manipulation and price suppression to friends and family

Either provide concrete facts & analysis that could support your bearish sentiment, or if you think I’m such a fool, then take my free money and short it 


No more defense. If someone wants to bash GameStop as a company or being a shareholder of GME, show me facts or shut your fucking mouth. MSM I’m looking at you.

The truth and the true price are inevitable. I don’t know when, but it’s coming
