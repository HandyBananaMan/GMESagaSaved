I reckon that the cost of hiding this recent FTD cycle to make it look like sideways trading has cost far more than is currently apparent. \n\nI believe that there have been phone calls and deals buying a few more days while they try to break sentiment and undo the correct summations from hank's and atobitts and criand's research. \n\nThe castle did not expect all the serfs to pick the right lotto numbers - ever - and now they're trying to change the rules stop the gold from going to the villagers while at the same time avoiding a revolt.",
