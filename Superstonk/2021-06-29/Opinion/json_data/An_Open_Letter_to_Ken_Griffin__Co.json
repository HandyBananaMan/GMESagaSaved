    "selftext": "To the Ken Griffins and Steve Cohens of the world, whilst this may never reach you, I'd be remiss to not air my forgiveness. It is simple, you have a disease. A disease that has turned you into nothing more than mere hosts for pure greed, absolute power. To this end, please consider the following. \n\nYou occupy a life where only one thing exists. Where friends, family, relationships are all but a passing blur in the window. A life where everything is there, at a moments notice. Food? Your personal chef. Clothes? Your assistant. Shelter? Take your pick of a number of multi-million dollar properties. \n\nHumans are built to overcome. To adapt, to fight, to survive. Many of us apes can recount tales of survival, tales of toil, where we have been pitted against it. Hell, this is a daily experience for a lot of us. But, it is the suffering that enables personal growth. The hard times, the \"I-almost-quit\" times, the \"I-have-to-become-a-better-person\" times.\n\nWell, my rich, illustrious hedge fund opposites, these days are now beginning to dawn on you. The experience is likely new and scary, perhaps they were the beginnings you have long forgotten about, but it is the place that your path has led to. Perhaps it is the first time you have felt yourself gasping for air as you go about your day, mind racing and heart palpitating. You are on the cusp of losing it **all**. The house of cards you have so carefully assembled was always going to come down eventually, and now, that eventuality draws near.\n\nThe human element of survival is quite possibly the closest you've felt to being human in a long time. Ironically, you are as close to us, the very apes you have disregarded and trodden on, as you ever have been.\n\nStill, you will destroy lives, you might feel shame, but your life will go on. Money will **never** be an issue. How could it be? How could you ever end up like one of us? The thought does not, and can not, compute.\n\nUltimately though, the apes will prevail, and our lives will be better for it, and if I may make a bold suggestion, *yours might be too*.\n\nLife is more than money. I know because I've never had it. It makes things easy, it eases worry and angst, it makes life simple. But you've taken it too far. It has taken over your very being. The numbers run your life, not you. You have no control, as much as you think you might. You cling to this doomed endeavour not because you think you can rescue it, but because you couldn't possibly imagine the consequences of your failure. My suggestion would be this. Accept your fate, welcome it with open arms. Lay down your weapons and begin the grief. This money weighs you down like cement shoes in the ocean, and it will drown you.\n\n Out of this entire saga, one of the things I have found is a new favourite quote, ***\"Some people are so poor, all they have is money\"*** - Bob Marley\n\nCould you imagine just one day, one day of bliss, without balance sheets, without analyst reports, without SEC investigations, without **noise**?\n\nAs a very simple, and smooth brained ape, my suggestion would be this. Accept your failure, own it, learn from it. Do not repeat the same mistakes, become revolutionary in your field and make people *happy*. If you profit from happiness, rather than misery, then you might find you gain more than just money in the process.",
