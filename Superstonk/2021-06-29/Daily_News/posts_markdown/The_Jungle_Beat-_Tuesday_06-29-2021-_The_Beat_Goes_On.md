Remember that trends show this rate typically doubles at quarter end, which is tomorrow. So we very well could see this number in the Trillions this week.

# Trading 212

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago, in an effort to try to get T212 to allow shareholder voting, some members alerted me that they were using US Treasury bonds as collateral, which I tweeted furiously @ them about (with no response, ofc). In the weeks since, this has become common knowledge in the community and it seems to have opened many questions and spurred a few interesting DDs (including making the connection that T-Bonds are feeding the RRP machine since they are considered adequate collateral for ONRRP).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/64d42rw2g9871.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=89987969c027febb2a87507cc4c75d31f14558a3

There has also been a lot of talk (and FUD) about Trading 212 and their share lending policy. While it appears to be true that you cannot opt out of the share lending program (unless you have an ISA account, in which case, you are exempt and your shares are safe), it has been used to create a LOT of FUD.

First of all, it is in the ToA as their client that they can lend your shares. This is part of their business model:

&#x200B;

![credit u\/J5T94 ](https://preview.redd.it/rs7od0n8c9871.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fff3acd948aee5c9ce9a7efae2c039d4300ca77)

&#x200B;

There were several subsequent posts outlining what to do if you are a T212 customer, building on the FUD.

We aren't financial advisors here, so we really can't tell you what to do with your stock held in T212. But it has been pointed out that in order to *transfer* your shares, you must *sell* them (so you're essentially just transferring cash). So do with that info what you will.

&#x200B;

For clarification, the mod team is discussing this T212 issue, though it seems pretty simple. Here's a comment from u/atobitt:

>Several concerning things going on here.  
>  
>Since brokers are able to provide US Treasuries (or cash) as collateral for lending out your shares, it seems really suspicious that the reverse repos are sky high right now. There could be a strong correlation between the number of shares being lent and the number of treasuries (through the RRP) used as collateral.  
>  
>Furthermore, they don't make a "moderate profit" from share lending. According to Dr. T and Wes Christian (and I believe Carl Hagberg said it too) **share lending is the #1 revenue stream for many brokers.**

&#x200B;

Yes we have known this since January. But we have many new apes here learning the ropes and catching up on DD. TURN OFF MARGIN LENDING ON YOUR TRADE ACCOUNT.

&#x200B;

Remember that urgency and panic= FUD. If there's not an ACTUAL emergency going on, but a post is urging you to "act now!!!" it's relying on you to react on your feelings instead of logic. This is a classic shill tactic to prey on people (and a classic marketing tactic overall) so be sure to always give any urgent post an hour or 2, at least, to be peer-reviewed before reacting. 9/10 these things turn out to be FUD.

# Routing Your Purchases through IEX

&#x200B;

It's been a hot minute since we discussed this, but it's worth repeating. Certain American brokers like [TD Ameritrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mq8opq/how_to_use_investors_exchange_iex_with_td/) (idk of any European ones yet) allow you to route your shares purchased through various lit exchanges such as Investors Exchange (IEX). The purpose of doing this is to keep the transaction from routing through dark pools on OTC exchanges. Keeping your purchases on lit exchanges like IEX keeps HFTs (high frequency traders) from being able to get their hands on the transaction first and manipulate the trade- as Dave Lauer pointed out in his first AMA- and gives you a more quality transaction overall.

This topic came up again this morning with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oa7st6/citadel_really_doesnt_like_iex_if_you_have_the/) by [u/Key\_Coffee4941](https://www.reddit.com/user/Key_Coffee4941/).

&#x200B;

Citadel REEAAALLLLLYYYYY hates IEX apparently. This is a comment they left with the SEC last year.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So check with your broker to see if routing your purchases like this is an option!

# Reporting Content

&#x200B;

As we've discussed, we have had to tighten the reigns on the sub and members lately due to some allegations made of brigading coming from this sub. And we've been discussing the different possibilities here for how to handle it, and it was recommended by admin for us to report any abusive, harassing, targeted, or otherwise malicious content that is outside of their guidelines. So moderators have been actively doing so privately.

&#x200B;

But I want to take a moment to really appreciate and give a shout out to the apes that take the time to report things to us mods, to reddit admin, to DM us with info, to tag us in suspicious posts... although we don't always respond to every mention directly, please know that your diligence in bringing our attention to these issues is greatly appreciated. We are just over a dozen people managing almost a half a million community (we are, however, working on expanding the mod team). And without you all hitting report, we wouldn't know where trouble is brewing to be able to keep this community safe. So to everyone of you apes helping keep this community clean with us....

&#x200B;

🙌 **THANK YOU 🙌**

In addition to that point, we have also been actively removing bullying and harassing posts that target certain people. Yes we like to meme this situation with funny wanted posters and the like. But it's in poor taste and can easily be seen as harassment. So please keep in mind that we are here to discuss the Gamestop stock and company's future, and topics that relate to that. Anything else will be removed, per the rules. Just doing what we've got to do to keep the jungle safe. Ape no fight ape, and ape no fling shit at others 💖
