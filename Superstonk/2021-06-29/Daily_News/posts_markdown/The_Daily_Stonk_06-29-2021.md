# The Russel 1000

We've not seen a lot of movement this past week, but we did expect it, so today is the last T+2 day of the Russel 1k, meaning we could see some movement today, but perhaps they are also having trouble to find enough shares to even buy in right now.

It's unknown, but I guess time will tell.

# NFT

Foobar posted this screenshot yesterday, so I thought I'd check it out real quick.

He has since posted an update a couple of hours ago that "Revest" is not in any way related to GME.

So guess we'll still have to wait for some news to come out on that aspect and known what it will be.

Give it time guys, no rush.

# Banks go Batshit with Dividends

Ok so this one is a little tin foil, because this is off of memory and I couldn't find a source for the following.

<Tinfoil> I can remember in 2008 months before the actual crash happened they were pumping up dividends higher than usual, I was not involved in stocks back then so... yeah the fact I know about it shows that it was a big deal at the time and may have been an indicator of the incoming crash</tinfoil>

from  u/Prof_Dankmemes

Multiple banks (including JPC) are citing the Federal Reserve Stress Test as the reason for raising their dividends this quarter.

The lack of oversight and balance of power is fucking criminal:

Banks own the FED ‚û°Ô∏è FED pushes a ‚Äústress test‚Äù that cites outdated and underreported data ‚û°Ô∏è Banks then cite the ‚Äústress test‚Äù as proof that everything‚Äôs fine, that ‚Äòhyperinflation is nothing to worry about‚Äô. ‚û°Ô∏è Banks and bank-owned MSM use the story to raise dividends and raid their own cash reserves one last time before American Bastille ü§¨

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
