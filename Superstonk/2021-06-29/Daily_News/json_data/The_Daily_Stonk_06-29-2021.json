your daily news.\n\nDoes anyone smell that?\n\n\\*insert flashy intro

Sideways trading guy and exponential floor guy are joining forces :P\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[credit to

past week, but we did expect it, so today is the last T+2 day of the Russel 1k, meaning we could see some movement today, but perhaps they are also having trouble to find enough shares to even buy in right now.\n\nIt's unknown, but I guess time will tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2utwjvbsb6871.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd83e06afba9345fc916b85b52ffabbe0ad797f1\n\n# NFT\n\nFoobar posted this screenshot yesterday, so I thought I'd check it out real quick.\n\nHe has since posted an update a couple of hours ago that \"Revest\" is not in any way related to GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsrg6q26c6871.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=aad0117b26451767deb80f258a5b8a205c9a13fb\n\nSo guess we'll still have to wait for some news to come out on that aspect and known what it will be.\n\nGive it time guys, no rush.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld644qcnc6871.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=05836b2823f26e805d71ea1408ce378fc1c2dc27\n\nReply  u/bpawsitive got from the GME Blockchain team.\n\nLove the sentance \"We are humbled, and jacked as ever about the future\".... let me feed my bias ok, stop judging me Karen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1na2cc3xc6871.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=94a037719dea5bec0e02b83f1f381c994c8a0af7\n\nAlso seems that GME is not slowing down with those Fire hires

is a little tin foil, because this is off of memory and I couldn't find a source for the following.\n\n<Tinfoil> I can remember in 2008 months before the actual crash happened they were pumping up dividends higher than usual, I was not involved in stocks back then so... yeah the fact I know about it shows that it was a big deal at the time and may have been an indicator of the incoming crash</tinfoil>\n\nfrom  u/Prof_Dankmemes\n\nMultiple banks (including JPC) are citing the Federal Reserve Stress Test as the reason for raising their dividends this quarter.\n\nThe lack of oversight and balance of power is fucking criminal:\n\nBanks own the FED \u27a1\ufe0f FED pushes a \u201cstress test\u201d that cites outdated and underreported data \u27a1\ufe0f Banks then cite the \u201cstress test\u201d as proof that everything\u2019s fine, that \u2018hyperinflation is nothing to worry about\u2019. \u27a1\ufe0f Banks and bank-owned MSM use the story to raise dividends and raid their own cash reserves one last time before American Bastille

others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\nRemember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3q4s2hee6871.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9278008a17189e13a276e1979111aeabc40542c1\n\nremember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it
