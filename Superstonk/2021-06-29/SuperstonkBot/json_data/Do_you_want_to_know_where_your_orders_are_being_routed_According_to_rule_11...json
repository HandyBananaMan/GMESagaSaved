    "selftext": "Rule 606 encourages competition by enhancing the transparency of broker-dealer order handling and routing practices, according to the SEC.\n\n\n  \nBroker - dealers are required by law to provide you with a report letting you know where all your orders have been routed for the last 6 months.\n\nThey also have to disclose their relationship with the venue they choose to execute your order, like if they\u2019re getting paid for your order.\n\n\n  \n[https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;mc=true&amp;r=SECTION&amp;n=se17.4.242\\_1605](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&r=SECTION&n=se17.4.242_1605)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2018/34-84528.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2018/34-84528.pdf)\n\n\n  \n\n  \nUnder Rule 11Ac1-6 as adopted, a broker-dealer that routes orders on behalf of customers will be required to prepare quarterly reports that disclose the identity of the venues to which it routed orders for execution. The reports also will disclose the nature of the broker-dealer's relationship with those venues, including the existence of any internalization or payment for order flow arrangements. Finally, broker-dealers will be required to disclose, on customer request, where they routed a customer's individual orders for execution.\n\n\n  \n\n  \nSo if you didn\u2019t know about this and you want to know where your money is going, I would send an email to your broker requesting information pursuant to rule 11Ac1-6.\n\n---\n\n***This is not financial advice!***  \n*This post was **anonymously** submitted via **[www.superstonk.net](https://www.superstonk.net/)** and reviewed by our team.\nSubmitted posts are unedited and published as long as they follow r/Superstonk rules.*",
