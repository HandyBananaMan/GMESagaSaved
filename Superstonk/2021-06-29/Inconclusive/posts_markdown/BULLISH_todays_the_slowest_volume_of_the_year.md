Ladies and gentlemen,
i have been tracking volume for the last months. Never in 2021 has it taken more than one hour to reach the first 1m traded GME, in fact slowest time ive seen so far is like 51 minutes. It's now one hour, and we still have 100k volume to go. Amazing, this has NEVER been seen for all these months!


Why is this bullish? Glad you asked! Get a load of this: the $480 peak of Jan 27th was the day after the hitherto slowest volume day of the year. The slowest day was a tuesday, and the peak a wednesday. So, were now on a tuesday with the lowest volume so far since Oct 2020 or so. And tomorrow is... Wednesday.


Im not saying get your tits jacked, but, get your tits jacked!
