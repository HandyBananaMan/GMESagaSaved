IRL gets in the way sometimes. \n\nThis one has been a bit of a journey too. I don't have all the answers here, so again... I leave it to you to make your own interpretations... THIS IS MERELY A DISCOVERY JOURNEY OF PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. \n\nSMILE FOR THE CAMERA KENNY\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x7qiqgip6871.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=adab353e26fea00253b5b2156a4237f6f30b581c\n\nSo today's episode of BBC is going to start out at the public-facing image they want you to look at. For Kenny and his Wife at the time, that comes in form of the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation. \n\n***(They like this format: Bill and Linda Gates Foundation)***\n\nThe headline for the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation is:\n\n**The Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation believes that powerful ideas change the world. We identify and support pioneering leaders whose visionary ideas introduce new thinking and drive results. We focus on education, healthcare and the arts because these pursuits form the core of a vibrant, creative, and productive society.**\n\nAnd the Fact they have **PLEDGED** $100 million to charitable and philanthropic causes since 2009\n\nThis is their tagline in the media. Source: [https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/kenneth-and-anne-griffin-foundation-likely-to-close-due-to-divorce](https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/kenneth-and-anne-griffin-foundation-likely-to-close-due-to-divorce)\n\n**SO I DECIDED TO FACT CHECK THIS**\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIRST OFF - Let's address the fact that these numbers are all pledged!\n\nWhen you hear about X Billionaire donating to X cause, from what I can tell... this is usually in the form of a pledge, not a donation. So they get the headlines for setting up a Direct Debit to these causes so to speak... **10 million, might be 1 million a year for 10 years.** \n\nSECOND OFF - Take note of the year... $100 million since 2009\n\nI decided to WAYBACK MACHINE this shit, and found the website:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uz9vhqhks6871.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a3b362c07b3ac6f89e1e46a1f9436af2516835\n\nOk... so they do claim $100 million in pledges on their website, but... they claim since 1999.\n\n(10 years earlier than what the media reports)\n\nSO....\n\nThe foundation officially announced it would shut down in 2014.\n\nSo if you were to go with what the website claims, the foundation ran from 1999 - 2014.\n\n(Let's do some math)\n\n**That's 15 years!**\n\nOR... if you were to go by what the media claims or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Dias-Griffin) states, the foundation ran from 2009 - 2014....\n\n(Math pause...)\n\n**That's 5 years!**\n\nBUT... when we look at the IRS Form 990s... ([Which you can freely search here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/)) it will only show the company final letters (Which you would think are a confirmation of them disbanding, but is actually their confirmation of tax-exempt status)\n\n\\-- There were actually 2 of these listings for Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation with the same Final letters. \n\n\\-- BUT... I found out this was the normal process for the IRS. They no longer make public the records for charitable organizations that have shut down...\n\nCONVENIENT...\n\nLuckily... after a bit of Google Detectiving, I found a website that archives at least SOME of these old tax-exempt organizations. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut before we jump into the nitty-gritty... let's take a quick pause to appreciate some puppy pics...\n\nAww.... who's a good little boy??? Yes! You're a good little boy!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5hwdnnvu6871.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=e54ff3804daada52a5099ab89a8a7c1f82305ef2\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE KENNETH AND ANNE GRIFFIN FOUNDATION - FORM 990S.\n\n \n\n**2014:** [https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display\\_990/364747915/2014\\_12\\_PF%2F36-4747915\\_990PF\\_201410](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/364747915/2014_12_PF%2F36-4747915_990PF_201410)\n\nListed as $1.7 million donated  \n\nListed as $0 approved for future payment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSideways Reading - (These pages are always sideways on the IRS website for some reason...)\n\n* $1.6 million paid to\n* Breast Cancer Research Foundation: $10k\n* Chicago Council on Global Affairs: $25k\n* Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago Foundation: $550k\n* Robin Hood Foundation: $1 million\n* Rush Mother\u2019s Milk Club: $5k\n* Usher III Initiative: $50k\n\n \n\nIn this Filing\u2026 as of Oct 1, 2014 both **Ken and Anne signed a statement saying** that they have $650k of funds remaining in the foundation and a remaining commitment of $2 million to Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago\n\nRemaining funds and outside funds will pay this off. \n\nFoundation will be liquidated and dissolved\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15sdphznv6871.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=c31912d4644ea783d5be211774e70b43e7795165\n\n (Also in here\u2026 is that final letter confirming Dissolution that should prob be on the IRS website?

I DARE YOU!!!**\n\n**I DOUBLE DARE YOU!!!**\n\nYou WILL NOT FIND IT!\n\nI tried every variation of the name of this fund but I can't find anything!\n\nThis sent me on a LONG SEARCH APES...\n\nThis search almost had me at breaking point. \n\nI had almost given up... and was about to post this post as is...\n\nWhen it hit me!\n\nCan you guess what it was>?>?\n\nI have mentioned it in this DD... and trust me when I say this... it was hidden as 1 sentence in the mass of notes I've taken while researching this.\n\nI almost missed it.\n\nWHILE I WAIT TO SEE IF YOU APES CAN FIGURE OUT THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION...\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPUPPY BREAK!\n\nWho's got my finger... is it a WOLF... no!

APES... LET ME TELL YOU...\n\nI decided to do a fancy google search for the EIN number (Unique identifier) for each of these companies... and I stumbled across another archive database. \n\nThis archive has a lot less information it would seem...\n\nBut it does have this...\n\n[2011 - Form 990 - COMPANY: The Blue Knight Foundation](https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/view_990/271106860/18144bf08cbbe623768d225aa4442644)\n\n[2012 - Form 990 - COMPANY: The Blue Knight Foundation](https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/view_990/271106860/db80347caef04de02c9c02c9d4512718)\n\nAnd if you check these out... you'll notice in the company name field, you'll see:\n\n**THE BLUE KNIGHT FOUNDATION AKA THE KENNETH AND ANNE GRIFFIN FOUNDATION**\n\nSo Kenny tends to name his charities one thing and tell the media that's it's through an Alias name?\n\nWhy the fuck would you want to do that?\n\nSo if he's willing to do that once... could he be doing it again with the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund?\n\nIs there a fund out there that Kenny is managing, that like we previously showed... has the potential to be a whale in the stock market? \n\nWhy did the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation, claim to PLEDGE $100 million since 1999, tell the media it was actually founded in 2009... and yet actually only have records under that name from 2013 and 2014...???\n\nWhy does this article talk about:\n\n***In October 2006, the Griffins together with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation founded a new charter school in Chicago named the Woodlawn High School. Griffin\u2019s charitable foundation*** \n\n????????????????????????????\n\nSo many more questions Apes... so little time...\n\nStay tuned for the NEXT EPISODE of the BBC!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***PS... I've noticed that I have started to be referred as the BBC guy... is there any way I can get the community to reconsider this...
