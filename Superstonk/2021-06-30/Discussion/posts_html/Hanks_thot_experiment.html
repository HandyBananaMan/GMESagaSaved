<p>Hey everyone thanks for reading my post yesterday. I’m still on a break from making big DDs (unless I stumble upon something major that warrants immediate attention), but in the mean time I wanted to create a dialogue, a thought experiment if you will.</p>
<p>The point of this post is simply to create a discussion in the comments that will serve as ideas for future DDs for myself and other wrinkles as well as to generally facilitate a discussion.</p>
<p>Here are my discussion questions:</p>
<p>GENERAL QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>In your opinion, what is the most likely trajectory of GME (i.e. if you had to predict what it will do for the next few months, what would you say)?</p>
<pre><code>   What other scenarios could you see?
</code></pre>
<p>What topics do you want to see wrinkles make DDs about?</p>
<p>What are the biggest weaknesses in the body of content of our current DD (i.e. what topics do we need to focus on because they are weaker)?</p>
<p>What is the weakest part of the general theory of GME? What is the strongest?</p>
<p>SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>Even if the FTD cycle theory is incorrect, it’s still true that each cycle, the floor/support increases, which means that the price has increased steadily since February. However, as we all know, volume has been absolutely horrible – pathetic. In a normal stock, this increase would be called a nonvolume supported trend; however, I think most of us believe this is happening because apes are holding, so the volume is just day traders and the HFs have moved buying volume into OTC trades. With that in mind, let’s say that volume continues to decrease. If volume continues to decrease, assuming nothing material changes about GME, what do you think is the most likely trajectory (i.e. is there a point we could get to where volume would be miniscule or close to zero and if so what would do you think will happen)?</p>
<p>The $350 level seems to be significant. The previous two times we got near it, we were BRUTALLY rejected and saw HUGE downtrends. The only time we got over it was January, when the market literally shut down buying. With that in mind, what is your take on the significance of this level? Is there a method we could use to reverse engineer it to try to find SI? What would you like to see us focus on with DD here?</p>
<p>Do you think the MOASS will happen sooner (let’s say before the end of August) or later and why?</p>
<p>Many of you probably saw my last post where I used data from the absolute beauties that are our quants to determine that the “meme stocks” are correlated. My thoughts were that it indicated that institutions took large short positions on them all at the same time. What are your thoughts? Why do you think all of these stocks have been following similar patterns? IMO I don’t think retail is behind it because it’s impossible for a nonorganized/noncorrdinated group to make multiple stocks behave the same way for months. Though we undoubtedly have power, we can’t coordinate like HFs, so I don’t think that retail just randomly decided to buy and sell all of these at the same time? What do you think?</p>
<p>What do you think about GME and coin (can’t say because of automod)? I’ve documented the FTD cycle connection and how it might be used for covering, but what do you think?</p>
<p>We all thought that RC being named board lord would be the “catalyst” causing the MOASS, but GME has reacted inconsistently to catalysts. Do you think catalysts have are relevant anymore? Do you think a catalyst will cause the MOASS or do you think it will be random like January?</p>
<p>Finally, I expect this post to get a fair amount of activity, so if you have anything interesting to say or ask that I didn’t cover above please put it below! </p>
