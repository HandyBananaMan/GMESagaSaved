If the shfs were really all powerful they wouldn’t be panic short selling the instant the price goes up even a couple bucks. They’d be employing a more global, long-term strategy of domination that’s not so reactionary and knee jerk. 

While on the surface trading sessions over the last weeks have shown them seem to exert almost total control over price movement, when we look deeper we see that the fierce, instant, reactionary nature of their attacks is indicative of a cornered animal fighting for its very survival, not an all powerful entity in total control of the situation.
