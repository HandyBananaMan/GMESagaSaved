    "selftext": "If the shfs were really all powerful they wouldn\u2019t be panic short selling the instant the price goes up even a couple bucks. They\u2019d be employing a more global, long-term strategy of domination that\u2019s not so reactionary and knee jerk. \n\nWhile on the surface trading sessions over the last weeks have shown them seem to exert almost total control over price movement, when we look deeper we see that the fierce, instant, reactionary nature of their attacks is indicative of a cornered animal fighting for its very survival, not an all powerful entity in total control of the situation.",
    "title": "Their strategy has become to match retail candle for candle. Any upward momentum is immediately smacked down with the same force. They want us to think they\u2019re all powerful. But it reeks of weakness and desperation.",
