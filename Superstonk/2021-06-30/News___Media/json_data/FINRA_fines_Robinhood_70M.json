    "selftext": "FINRA just announced a major enforcement action against Robinhood for $70M, which breaks down to $57M fines and $12.6M restitution to clients. Here's the [press release](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial), and the [full action](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/robinhood-financial-awc-063021.pdf).\n\nThis is a pretty standard enforcement action - Robinhood neither admits nor denies the findings, and it's essentially a slap on the wrist. Robinhood [collected $331M in PFOF](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/robinhood-made-331-million-from-clients-trading-activity-in-q1-2021.html) in Q1 2021.\n\nRobinhood intentionally mislead their customers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tcb469l5f871.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d019e5e9180d93e8a3ca8e295c3d670cc23c943\n\nThere are many other violations in the order. Among them:\n\n*  Failure to exercise due diligence before approving options accounts \n*  Failure to supervise technology critical to providing customers with core broker-dealer services\n*  Failure to create a reasonably designed business continuity plan \n*  Failure to report customer complaints to FINRA \n*  Failure to have a reasonably designed customer identification program \n*  Failure to display complete market data information  \n\nThis is a pretty disturbing set of violations, and honestly it's surprising that they can continue to operate as a broker-dealer. This is an important enforcement action, but overall I'd call it a disappointment in terms of the cost to Robinhood and the remedial actions they need to take.",
