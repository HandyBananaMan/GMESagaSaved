The minted Hodlberg NFT aggregates all attested wallet balances, including other held NFTs, into one convenient token, without compromising privacy. The balance and token data aggregated into your Hodlberg NFT is always up-to-date.\n\n\nWhat this IS:\n\n* Confirmation Bias: HODL!\n\n* Evidence that Gamestop is going all-in on NFT as this is their Principal Engineer with deep NFT experience.\n\nWhat this IS NOT:\n\n* Evidence of a crypto currency dividend (NFT is not the same as crypto currency).\n\nVery excited to see what Jordan & the NFT team come out with in the coming weeks!\n\nBullish!!",
