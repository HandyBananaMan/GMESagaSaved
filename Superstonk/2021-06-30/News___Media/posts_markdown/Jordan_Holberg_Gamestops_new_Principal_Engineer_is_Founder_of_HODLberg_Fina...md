> Hodlberg ]-[ Financial lets one "attest" their cryptocurrency holdings across multiple blockchains and mint a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on [removed name of crypto exchange per automod]. The minted Hodlberg NFT aggregates all attested wallet balances, including other held NFTs, into one convenient token, without compromising privacy. The balance and token data aggregated into your Hodlberg NFT is always up-to-date.


What this IS:

* Confirmation Bias: HODL!

* Evidence that Gamestop is going all-in on NFT as this is their Principal Engineer with deep NFT experience.

What this IS NOT:

* Evidence of a crypto currency dividend (NFT is not the same as crypto currency).

Very excited to see what Jordan & the NFT team come out with in the coming weeks!

Bullish!!
