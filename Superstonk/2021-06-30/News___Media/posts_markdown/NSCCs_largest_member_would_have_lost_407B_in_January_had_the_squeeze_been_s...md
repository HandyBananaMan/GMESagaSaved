TA;DR; 

They’re scared and have required even more capital from members since January because *shorts haven’t covered.*

Projected losses would have exceeded available funds. $16.9B already paid out by one member to cover existing exposure. 

Total incurred Q1 margin breaches were over $1B, up 300% from Q1 2020. 

Liquid resources are now at $54.4B.
