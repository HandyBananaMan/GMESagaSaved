<p>FINRA just announced a major enforcement action against Robinhood for $70M, which breaks down to $57M fines and $12.6M restitution to clients. Here's the <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial">press release</a>, and the <a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2021-06/robinhood-financial-awc-063021.pdf">full action</a>.</p>
<p>This is a pretty standard enforcement action - Robinhood neither admits nor denies the findings, and it's essentially a slap on the wrist. Robinhood <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/robinhood-made-331-million-from-clients-trading-activity-in-q1-2021.html">collected $331M in PFOF</a> in Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Robinhood intentionally mislead their customers:</p>

<p>There are many other violations in the order. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to exercise due diligence before approving options accounts </li>
<li>Failure to supervise technology critical to providing customers with core broker-dealer services</li>
<li>Failure to create a reasonably designed business continuity plan </li>
<li>Failure to report customer complaints to FINRA </li>
<li>Failure to have a reasonably designed customer identification program </li>
<li>Failure to display complete market data information  </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a pretty disturbing set of violations, and honestly it's surprising that they can continue to operate as a broker-dealer. This is an important enforcement action, but overall I'd call it a disappointment in terms of the cost to Robinhood and the remedial actions they need to take.</p>
