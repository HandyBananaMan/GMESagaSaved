[It's all coming together!](https://preview.redd.it/plzxtv2zqh871.jpg?width=1112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ebb298b1ec7f8ca6b1b36b3f632fffa743f008e)

**Here I try to combine all the great DD found here on this sub, and try to distill the final endgame from the available DD.**

I'm also releasing this at a point when it's too late for shorts, and it's gameover. If I'm wrong then this DD is meaningless. If I'm right, shorts are strapped into final destination while a dental clairvoyant describes their death to them in clear detail.

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**

**Edit: ETF SHORTING is the main point of this post, and more attention needs to be placed there. NOT crypt0 - it's a sidepoint. Anyone bringing up excess attention to the sidepoint should have their post history checked for shill bias.**

* Fatal mistake by shorts on 6-9-2021 when GME's ETF's were all shorted at once. ETF's work on T+6 settlement.
* Doesn't matter what shorts do, checkmate was set following completion of 5 million share offering during earnings call.
* ~~Cypto announcement will be the match.~~ T+35 FTDs will be the Fuel. (speculation, sidepoint)
   * GME Q2 ends Aug-1, need more wrinkles thinking about this than just me.
* ETFs containing GME (ETFGME) will rocket, all other ETFs with overlap with ETFGMEs will crater.
* **If** you have wallet already, set aside digital currency in preperation to remove Gamecoin from circulation as soon as it launches  (no collusion, also it's just good to be first)
* Kenny/Citadel may just be the fall guy, I speculate it's much deeper than just their figurehead.

**Preface**

I'm not a financial advisor. Everything stated here should be taken as speculation. As a matter of fact I'm actually down like 20K in paper losses. If anything do the opposite of what I'm doing - or don't lol. Simply put I'm a nobody, with dreams of putting an end to this financial slavery.

&#x200B;

For the most part most of this should be read in order. If you need to go back to read up on some of the sub topic go ahead - time is mostly on YOUR side.

&#x200B;

This DD is certainly rushed, while building up a multi-month position and there's probably a TON of spelling and grammer mistakes throughout. So do forgive this once dropped as a baby Ape. With that out of the way, here's a summary of what I've pieced together thanks to this great community, and special users discussed below. If you keep reading till the end, there's also a speculative arguement to be had with social media and the rest.

//

**Acronym Index and Glossary (copied over from Anon's DD for quick reference):**

Because I always wish the SEC included these, for the Fed if nothing else

ETF - Exchange-Traded-Fund - Simply put, ETFs are a hybrid between funds and stocks. They, like any fund, hold some portfolio of securities. And like any stock, they trade as shares on open exchanges. For example, SPY is an ETF with a portfolio designed to mimic the S&P 500 index.

ETFGME - ETFs containing GME

FTD - Failure-to-Deliver - after the sale of a security, the seller (believe it or not) has 3 days to deliver the security to the buyer, otherwise the share is deemed failed-to-deliver - a FTD.

AP - Authorized Participant - “An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund (ETF)….When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants can make more. Conversely, authorized participants will reduce ETF shares in circulation when the price of the ETF is lower than the price of the underlying shares. That can be done with the creation and redemption mechanism that keeps the price of an ETF aligned with its underlying net asset value (NAV).”

MM - Market Maker - Market Makers, very generally, oversee markets and quote bid/ask prices to create a spread. They stand ready to buy or sell in their market, and they have algorithms coded to hedge these transactions and profit from arbitrage along the way.

HF(s) - Hedge fund(s)

**THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS - REQUIRED READING.**

**Part 1: The FTD Cycle.**

https://preview.redd.it/s3odahn1rh871.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c3f53e1404d686cf2a0cbae90e06d873e4d0a94

Not enough credit can be given to u/dentisttft and his post detailing the T+35 FTD cycle, SLD periods, and how it relates to volatility in GME.

This is a must read to understand the bigger picture, and give this guy more awards.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o155a6/t35\_is\_the\_one\_true\_cycle\_evidence\_to\_back\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o155a6/t35_is_the_one_true_cycle_evidence_to_back_my/)

&#x200B;

**Main take aways:**

* T+21 are approximations of T+35's low liquidity periods.
* FTDs are created T+#settlement trading days. For regular naked shorting this is T+2. (more on settlement dates later)
* MM's wait to cover to attempt to maximize their profits.
* 34 calendar days after the generation of an FTD, MM's must cover. (T+35 days if you count day of FTD creation)

&#x200B;

**Part 2: Shorting through ETF's**

In a mysterious fashion, a now deleted user /u/leavemeanon (Anon) dropped the mother of all DD's detailing how MMs and HFs can use ETF's to short a stock.

There's been numerous references by Gamestop to this user, but nothing else is known about /u/leavemeanon or his real origins.

Though the original user and posts are gone, u/VoxUmbra was nice enough to find and upload an archive of /u/leavemeanon's posts.

Read all 3 parts.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip\_uleavemeanon\_where\_are\_the\_shares\_part\_1/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8ot8/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

**Main take aways:**

* APs and MM can short securities by selling ETFs without finding underlying shares to create said ETF. Like selling a fruit basket, but promising the fruit later.
* This is made possible due to a T+6 settlement of ETFs, and another securties act 1933 loophole allowing OFF-THE-BOOKS record keeping if you decompose an ETF. These shorts are naked and untracked by SI%.
* Insitutions can theoretically cycle ETFs every 6 days to hide shorts indefinitely, while being eaten alive by interest and premium.
* ETFs alone hold nearly the entire float of GME on their own without a single share of retail.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Part 3: Hints at Overvote.**

The single greatest piece of direct evidence of an overvote is this rounding error found by u/Rimigo42

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw9sl1/math\_error\_in\_8k\_filing\_possible\_a\_typo\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/nw9sl1/math_error_in_8k_filing_possible_a_typo_that/)

Other hints at overvoting:

**Main take aways:**

* Rounding error indicates votes ARE trimmed.
* Trimming is *typically* reserved for overvotes.

&#x200B;

**Part 4: Regulation and recent changes to chess board.**

**Main take aways:**

* 002 makes everyday an SLR period, and no longer on a rolling cycle. (Added to federal registar, now official)
* Rest are generally there to protect the core DTCC, not malicious shorting HFs.

**MOASS**

Warning this is kinda datey, no promises. You gotta keep up the hype though, Hedge funds are hoping to drag this out hoping to collect enough option premium from retail to cover their losses. Time is mostly on our side (months), but wait too long and they WILL defuse the situation by eating retail premium.

&#x200B;

Ok lets start. We all know GME has been in a fight with predatory trading practices for awhile now. To the extent we find ourselves at the very beginnings of a short squeeze. We know this thanks to the hard work of u/dentisttft who broke the FTD code as indicated above. However, last month the publicly known FTDs HAVE died down quite a bit as indicated on SEC's website. I use the word publicily here because as Anon has pointed out, many naked shorts can be hidden through the use of ETFs - more on that later.

&#x200B;

Lets first take a look at the events of 6-9-2021, the day prior to ShareHolder's Meeting. It is a not a fond memory for many apes. The 5 million share offering did hurt the price after the announcement, but what really made things bad at the time was the intentional capitulation /short ladder BEFORE the meeting by shorts causing a 10% decrease even before GME tried raising capital - THIS IS WHY WE HOLD, money going to hedgies rather than the company that needs it!.

&#x200B;

As pointed out by ZION LION u/ZIONLIO29288757 on twitter here:

https://preview.redd.it/00nkii14rh871.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=faecc15e333fa1b0678d6811bc7ae57a8071a0ca

Many of ETF were sold short. What does this mean from the perspective of MOASS? Well a few things.

As Anon explained: ETFs can be unpacked to retreive the shares inside. What I suspect happened are that MM and other HFs that knew an offering was going to take place, purchased a bunch of ETFGMEs while simutaneously shorting GME. MMs(et al.) can later unpack ETFGMEs to cover their shorts. But this leaves a question where are the naked shorts?

&#x200B;

Well Anon answered that too. Shorts created by selling uncovered ETFs do NOT have to be reported unless they turn into FTDs at T+6 due to a loophole in the Securities Act of 1933. However, you can cover your prior naked short by buying yet another ETFGME and unpacking it, thus passing the naked short down the line to the next AP that created the uncovered ETF - and best of all, not report it to anyone. This is equivalent to selling empty fruit baskets without the fruit, and covering said basket with another empty basket every 6 days. ETFGMEs holders are owed GME shares.

&#x200B;

And as Anon has pointed out, GME's entire float is already locked within ETF shares without counting a single retail share. Considering that at the same time we apes also hold the near entirety of the float back in April 15th, we know this based off GME's 8-K filing. There is undeniabily, at a minimum 1x float worth of GME naked shorts floating around (even excluding overvote scenario). the MOASS will be a financial lesson taught to your grandchildren for decades to come (if you decide to have them). This doesn't even take into account an overvote, nor possibility of any naked shorts overseas due to different reporting regulations overseas. Buckle Up.

&#x200B;

**The fatal moves of 6-9-2021:**

https://preview.redd.it/7ljlofc5rh871.png?width=1349&format=png&auto=webp&s=473eb82eb33834db86f30bcd09b95c6249bff9ff

This was delta neutral MM's shorting GME and covering their shorts almost immediately by buying ETFGMEs, and passing the naked GME short onto the ETFGME creator - the AP's (think Citadel et al.). It would become near impossible to hide the FTDs from the T+6 settlement, as naked shorts would preoccupy the next ETF. Looking at settlement, FTDs from 6-9-2021's ETFGME short should occur on 6-17-2021.

&#x200B;

The following day on 6-10-2021, we all remember was the day of the combined 10% + 10% drop. The pre-dilution 10% drop was the initial MM short + covering, the next drop however was all AP's (Citadel et al.) plus the added selling pressure by 5 million share dilution. Effectively GME was shorted twice by AP's, and probably covered half by the drop. Leading me to think AP's and Short HFs have net added to their short positions since earnings. This is well suported by the daily short volume on GME being greater than 50%. Because 6-10's were normal shorts - FTDs would be created on 6-14-2021. This coordinated (COLLUSION) attack by combined MM's and AP's was likely aimed at full capitulation, they FAILED and all they did was use up a lot of their firepower, further increased their short position, and set the floor we are trading now.

&#x200B;

Why these dates are important. FTD filings and SEC reports occur on the 14th, and last day of the month, meaning we will only see at most HALF of total shorts reported this Wednesday 6-30-2021. Keep that in mind, because we'll be see increasing GME FTDs through this month's report on last month's FTD activities.

&#x200B;

|Short Type|Settlement|GME occurrence|FTD creation|SEC reports|T+35 covering|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Naked ETF shorting|T+6 trading|06/09/21|06/17/21|07/15/21|07/21/21|
|Naked Stock Shorting|T+2 trading|06/10/21|06/14/21|06/30/21|07/18/21|

&#x200B;

SEC report dates here:

[https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

&#x200B;

This will start the ball rolling as long HFs will be watching the FTDs. A sizable increase in FTDs would green light Long HFs to start adding a ton of buying pressure. Remember T+21 is a FUD narrative (only an approximation on SLR and the real T+35, which is now patched with DTCC-002). This will continue throughout most of July, because of DTCC-002 SLR is everyday.

I was able to pull the FTD data from today, so if you turn your attention here, you'll can see the FTD uptick.

https://preview.redd.it/1zg9gg67rh871.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d2597bdf74cb7ed123234572deb8439c656f566

Another key is concentrated buying pressure - because of how the US markets are constructed. Long play BS (the way it's portrayed) on r/superstonk is by far some of the worst FUD here, not just because it's bad investment advice, but because it is a pathologically lazy statement for people thinking the price will climb slowly to millions over their lifetime, and they can get in 2 months from now and expect the price to still be at $200. Think of this from the FTD POV, the only way to increase FTDs is concentrated buying pressure. This is a battle against market manipulation, if shorts win the price will fall and will never make it's way back up because they will reinforce a ceiling by buying and controlling the float themselves, but a retail win will cement a higher floor as the FTD bug provides a floor that locks wealth in the market and makes it hard for new shorts to push the price down. Someone do a seperate DD on this! It is in Gamestop's best interest for retail win as it would mean more capital in the long term. HFs manipulate and pull liquidity away during capital raises, making it hard and even costly to raise capital - Retail has no such problem.

**SPECULATIVE SOCIAL REASONING FOR MOASS AND HYPE**

Interestingly I believe there's a good chance Ryan Cohen is going to trigger the MOASS with the announcement of a Gamecoin (**speculation**, **sidepoint**). As prior posts have pointed out, there's a hidden launch date hardcoded to 7-14-21. There's alot of good DD on this topic, mainly because most of the shills don't actually know enough about the topic (shill lackey). Generally, at the launch of digital coins, either they are bought at open market immediately or they are sold prior to stakers who then sell on the open market.

Digital currency is unique amongst all securities, in that it's value is driven purely by supply and demand. Given a fair exchange without excess leverage, the price of the currency is dictated by the holder, where it should be.

This means it pays to be first buyer of any Gamestop coin, especially if it's tied to your GME shares. To be first you need to have funds readily available for trading to purchase the moment any potential Gamecoin hits the market. Unfortunately, anyone that's tried digital currency knows there's typically a waiting period on USD funds. This can be bypassed by having a digital wallet with funds ready to go to quickly send funds to Gamecoin's host exchange. So heads up \^\^ here.

**Edit, to be clear: GME is the play. Heads up is referring IF you already have a wallet.**

**If** a Gamecoin is released, you can be dam sure the Gamecoin price will skyrocket (As any holder of shorts will need to pay this coin to shareholders). However, it would make very little sense to allow the coin to be sold first to the open market if it's first being distributed as a dividend. Though ultimately this is a mute point in the case of real short interest being over 100%, as GameStop would simply only release just the right amount of coins to cover the float. Market forces and a proper working exchange will manage the rest.

&#x200B;

So if we assume the GameCoin will be used as a dividend, when does GameStop need to make the announcement?

10 calendar days prior to date of record - July 4th.

Calling everyday Hype is FUD, concentrated hype is how you break sell-walls and force shorts to cover

**Here's a Hype Calendar Summarizing the above:**

**TECHNICAL REASONS FOR MOASS**

I want to give a shout out to Reddit-censored youtuber\*\*. Who's most of the time down to earth. In one of his more recent summaries found ![here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCSb61wD7aM) he made an interesting observation.

There are bullish technical indicators all around indicating huge suppression and fuckery, as of late.

\*\*PS. Debugging the reddit filters was a pain - LMFAO, you can't drop his name on reddit.

&#x200B;

As a Technical Analysis(TA) guy myself. Here's just ONE example:

https://preview.redd.it/nu1dkj0grh871.png?width=1305&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76e15f15757ca1710530d5450bac3b2859a31e9

But really **confirm it for yourself,** pull up really any reliable TA metric designed to track fuckery, like RSI/MACD divergence, Bollinger Bands, Crayon lines, you name it. We are overdue for a huge correction upward. The Hype is real.

**In short, I am but one Ape trading on my own.**

**This DD is in my best interest as the more educated we Apes are, the more concentrated firepower we have as a whole. It pays to be on the same page.**

&#x200B;

**Edit: I am NOT suggesting you buy digital currency (it's not confirmed and is pure speculation). But heads up if you happen to have a wallet.**

**Edit2: This is why I love the community, the reviewers.** A commentor below  **pointed out Gamestop's Q1 ended May 1st. This puts Gamestop's Q2 end on Aug 1st. I will have to think about this, if dividend is justified.**
