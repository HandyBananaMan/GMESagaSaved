<p>I work with a small, independent financial institution and I was tasked with doing some research about market volatility.</p>
<p>I found that ETFs have increased almost 18 fold (from about 120 to 2200) since 2003, which of course means more companies are being tied to variables other than performance to determine stock price.</p>
<p>I wanted to compare that to the number of domestic companies listed on the market to try and figure out an “average” number of ETFs a stock is in to come up with my own volatility metric.</p>
<p>It was shockingly hard to find how many US companies are listed on the public market by year. In order to get that figure, I had to hunt and pull from numerous sources - especially for more recent years.</p>
<p>We used to report how many companies were listed publicly on the market to the World Bank by country. The U.S. stopped doing that in 2018.</p>
<p>But why’d we stop reporting such a basic piece of information?</p>
<p>Because it was bad. You see, the number of companies listed on the stock market has been in a steady decline for the better part of 20 years. In 2003, there were about 5200 domestic companies on the market. Today, it’s just under 3000.</p>
<p>Interestingly, mass media stopped reporting on this alarming decline. I found an article on this topic from the WSJ titled “Where have all the public companies gone?”- from 2017. There has been some better coverage of the matter on foreign pubs like the Financial Times, but still pretty barren.</p>
<p>Why did we stop reporting the number of domestic companies listed on the market to the World Bank in 2018, and any coverage of this matter by U.S. media outlets basically get cut off around the same time?</p>
<p>Because the situation actually took a major dive. We were losing a maybe 100, 200 companies a year on the steady decline, but between 2018 and 2019, we lost about 900. The news was so bad we didn’t even want to tell the World Bank, and the financial media didn’t bother to cover it because they’re spineless pieces of shit funded to push a narrative onto the masses. It’s why they exist, it’s who pays the bills. It’s why I say we need to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oalt6n/buying_awards_from_reddit_incentivizes_them_to_do/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">pick a media source and collectively pay their bills, or all we’ll get is the “news” someone else paid for us to get. </a></p>
<p>So what they did to offset the fact that they had cannibalized the American economy was create more and more ETFs. Fluff. ETFs are the stock market’s CDO analog. I believe this is the real impetus behind the SPAC wave we had - fewer companies want to go public and put their companies in the trash compacter that is the American stock market. Those assholes just want to put their straws in your milkshake and are trying to find victims and lead them there. It also explains the drastic <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/06/08/private-equity-market-poised-for-growth/amp/">rise in private equity</a>  - they had to go hunting. Wouldn’t you know it, the exponential rise in SPACs began right about the same time we stopped reporting how many domestic companies were on the US stock market. Needed more lambs to slaughter.</p>
<p>It’s convenient that the media hasn’t been reporting on the fact that the pool of public American companies is shrinking, because now, as companies are increasingly grouped in ETFs, which by extension creates volatility, they can blame it on UnSoPhIsTiCaTeD rEtAiL tRaDeRs despite the fact that this trend has been in motion for decades. My guess is after the 2018 drop, they realized their parasitic ways were going to kill the host. so they really went ham with fraud.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take a financial degree to know that fewer companies means bigger wealth disparities.</p>
<p>Not quite GME related, but further support for the disgusting practices of Wall Street and their “it’s poor peoples fault” tired ass playbook.</p>

<p>The article with the graph I made to visualize this trend: <a href="https://myhappynest.com/3-reasons-why-private-reits-are-strategic-hedges-against-volatility/">https://myhappynest.com/3-reasons-why-private-reits-are-strategic-hedges-against-volatility/</a></p>
<p>Not sure I can just post the graphic here, but full disclosure, this is to the site I was doing the article for, so it's promoting a private REIT. They don't even know I'm posting about this, I just thought it was interesting info.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I added this as an article to my independent media site. Someday, I hope to make a living off of reporting on things that matter. You may find this surprising, but my type of reporting isn't welcome in what this community refers to as the 'MSM,' the Corporate Marketing Machine (This is CMM).  <img alt="https://upsidechronicles.com/2021/06/30/wall-street-is-framing-the-retail-investor-for-the-impending-disaster-they-created-again/" src="https://upsidechronicles.com/2021/06/30/wall-street-is-framing-the-retail-investor-for-the-impending-disaster-they-created-again/" /></p>
<p>If I hit it in the MOASS, I will make <em>Upside Chronicles</em> the people's media source. My only agenda is to cut through the nonsense. But like you, I have bills to pay, so I have to make things work. best I can do for now.</p>
