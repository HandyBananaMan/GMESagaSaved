<p>There's been lots of advice since January about "lawyering up" after MOASS. Sadly, you can't just dial 1-800-lawyers and ask the answering service to connect you to a...money(?) attorney. So I spoke to my uncle who is a district judge in the great state of...well, one of the great states in these United States. International apes, this might still apply, but your kilometrage may vary.</p>
<p>Anyway, I asked him, hypothetically if someone were to win a bunch of money in the lottery, like a hundred million or so, what kind of attorney should they get? He replied with some helpful ideas I wanted to share because it's not like you just walk into a law office and say "I'd like 1 lawyer, please!"</p>
<p>He said to get a tax attorney who is also a CPA that can provide estate planning. A large firm should also be able to provide the following services and may be of interest to the "newly wealthy"</p>
<ul>
<li>Wealth management</li>
<li>Estate management</li>
<li>Tax planning</li>
<li>Multi-generational trusts</li>
<li>Wills</li>
<li>Living trusts </li>
<li>Asset protection</li>
<li>Charities</li>
<li>Private foundations</li>
</ul>
<p>This helped me narrow down what to look for and where. And something I didn't know, attorneys are licensed by state, so don't think you need to fly to New York or LA to get a "national" attorney. The bigger firms in your state's largest cities should have all of this available. Also, don't gift money or assets (stocks, cars, etc) worth more than $15k per recipient per year or else you'll have to deal with the IRS over gift tax. Set up a trust for this kind of stuff if you want to take care of/help out family and friends.</p>
