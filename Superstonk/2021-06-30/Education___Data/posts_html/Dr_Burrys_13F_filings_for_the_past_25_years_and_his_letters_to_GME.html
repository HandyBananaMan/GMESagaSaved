<p>so ive been looking in to Dr. Burry for a bit now and wanna share what ive found and what i think has been going on in the markets. also keep in mind **this is not financial advice** and that i am piecing all of this together just as much as the next.</p>
<p>Scion Asset Management: run by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry">Dr. Burry</a></p>
<p>Scion's SEC filings: <a href="https://sec.report/CIK/0001649339">https://sec.report/CIK/0001649339</a></p>
<p>(13F: filed when assets under management is &gt; 100MM USD, 13D: filed when acquiring 5% ownership of a company, 13D/A: amendment to a previously filed 13D)</p>
<p>in the SEC link above you'll notice that there's a gap in submissions from 2016 - 2019, so i naturally wanted to see why he got back in &gt; 100MM.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of all the filings after 2016 (sequential last 10 quarters):</p>

<p>and here they all are tabulated</p>

<p>my thoughts on Burry's return:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1404568788327178244">he's back with a vengance</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Burry is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics">macro-economic</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing">value</a>  investor.</p>
<p>he found Deep Fucking Value in tailored brands and GME, so he went in. then he realized that the american economy actually just consists of tiny disconnected bubbles (due to derivatives, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2IaJwkqgPk">inside job documentary on YT</a>).</p>
<p>thats why he was so successful in 2008 (even though he started his short position in 2005) and thats why his last 13F is betting on the 20 year bond index (tracks the 20 year treasury) falling.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the house of cards begins to fall when one entity cant post collateral bc it was never theirs. it actually was borrowed and belongs to someone else but that person doesnt really own it either bc its borrowed from someone el--......... you already know about rehypothecation, dont you?</p>
<p>the reverse repo market has been going absolutely bonkers this year and more participants are joining over time (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ob1v0o/daily_reverse_repo_update_0630_991939b_new_record/h3kz1bx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">46 participants ---&gt; 90 participants in 1 month</a>):</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/phz72r6w9h871.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4be0e30077900cf7969918bd1e01a09e7bbd278">https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RRPONTSYD</a></p>
<p>my theory is that as apes keep holding and causing failure to delivers, more and more participants are jumping in to the reverse repo market to borrow treasury so they can post collateral. its literally just a game of who can hold longer at this point</p>
<p>but the real, economic and systemic, issue in America is the federal funds rate which has been getting obliterated <strong>SINCE 1980</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hbppeartah871.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=297c7a4a31009d97f127739c3af83c1edfc1efd2">https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/FEDFUNDS</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp">federal funds rate</a> is what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee">FOMC</a> (monetary policy body of the federal reserve) sets 8 times a year. its the interest rate that banks charge each other when they want to borrow from one another. it drives the rate of your mortgage, auto-loan, stock market sentiment, etc.</p>
<p>since its been so low for so long, the rich / 1% got so fucking greedy that they just kept asking one another to borrow shit from since it was so cheap to and pumped up bubbles to get rich off of. now that a bunch of apes are holding GME and causing FTD, some of these fuckers had to dip in to the rev. repo market to borrow directly from the fed so they can post collateral. even the best of these banks are fucked - dont be surprised if even fucking JPM goes under.</p>
<p>fuck you Jamie Dimon for <a href="https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/maloney-rice-call-on-jpmorgan-chase-to-return-overdraft-fees-charged">collecting 1.3 BILLION</a> in overdraft charges during COVID in 2020. how you gonna charge someone for not having money, you fucking dick.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the unfortunate truth is that the world and common men have been distracted by new iphones, sports, a mind-numbing collection of streaming shows, etc.</p>
<p>while we were all easily engrossed in low hanging fruit, the rich kept getting rich.... but time is on our side - just buy and hold (not financial advice).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dr. Burry wrote to GME's board 3 times in 2019... on 7/28, 8/16, and 8/26.</p>
<p>i couldnt find this filing on the SECs site (sus), but here is the link:</p>

<p>all that said, keep in mind that retail owns the float at this point, not investments funds.. let that sink in. ordinary people like you and me. and they need these shares...</p>

<p>wanna know why hes been buying land w water rights since 2008? ...bc thats all that will be left as climate change picks up. it is fucking scorching here in the US. see arizona, PNW, remember the fucking wildfires last year? wanna bet on what July will be like? remindme me.</p>
<p>sure we can just not have gender reveals, but we dont even have the <img alt="infrastructure" src="https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1408230349314957318" /> to put them out when they happen. what if we could contain quicker than it can duplicate? when the fuck is anyone gonna fix a problem around here?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>burry has been in favor of nuclear which is a cleaner and more efficient way to draw power. sure it could be less stable over time or even as-is, but imagine if the cost of literally all the stupid shit that has been pumped (what even is the upgrade from iphone 8 to iphone X, how much did apple profit?), would have been divested to generating technology to support?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what do you know about the electric smart motor?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>imagine Earth not needing to excrete emissions to generate electricity/power. what would you do w all that extra cash?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the logical thing to do is create technologies that prolong human life as long as possible on planet Earth, everywhere, all over, for everyone, equally at minimum. this is ordinary physics at play and it can never be beat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>thats my take on what has happened here for the past 29 years.</p>
