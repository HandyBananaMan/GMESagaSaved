There's been lots of advice since January about "lawyering up" after MOASS. Sadly, you can't just dial 1-800-lawyers and ask the answering service to connect you to a...money(?) attorney. So I spoke to my uncle who is a district judge in the great state of...well, one of the great states in these United States. International apes, this might still apply, but your kilometrage may vary.

Anyway, I asked him, hypothetically if someone were to win a bunch of money in the lottery, like a hundred million or so, what kind of attorney should they get? He replied with some helpful ideas I wanted to share because it's not like you just walk into a law office and say "I'd like 1 lawyer, please!"

He said to get a tax attorney who is also a CPA that can provide estate planning. A large firm should also be able to provide the following services and may be of interest to the "newly wealthy"

*  Wealth management
* Estate management
* Tax planning
* Multi-generational trusts
* Wills
* Living trusts 
* Asset protection
* Charities
* Private foundations

This helped me narrow down what to look for and where. And something I didn't know, attorneys are licensed by state, so don't think you need to fly to New York or LA to get a "national" attorney. The bigger firms in your state's largest cities should have all of this available. Also, don't gift money or assets (stocks, cars, etc) worth more than $15k per recipient per year or else you'll have to deal with the IRS over gift tax. Set up a trust for this kind of stuff if you want to take care of/help out family and friends.
