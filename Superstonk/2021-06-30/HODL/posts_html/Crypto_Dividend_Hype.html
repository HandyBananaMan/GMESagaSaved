<p>EDIT 2 - This goes on the top, because it's important: I am not in ANY way saying that we should not be hyped.  I am saying that even if this <em>one</em> thing we are hyped about does not happen, there is still a LOT to be hyped about!  So <em>if</em> there is no crypto dividend, there is no need to be disappointed.  Because GME has hype for miles.</p>
<p>I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the fact that many here are hyped over the possibility of GameStop issuing a crypto dividend. </p>
<p>TBH, it would be awesome.  And according to everything we know, it would absolutely screw the hedgies. </p>
<p>That being said, I think itâ€™s worth reminding everyone:</p>
<p><em>Gamestop may not have any plan to issue any dividend, crypto or otherwise.</em></p>
<p>This is an assumption on our part, based solely on the facts that it would be awesome, and it would most likely launch the rocket.  </p>
<p>But in the event that they do not issue a dividend, donâ€™t let it being you down.  A crypto dividend isnâ€™t the only thing that will launch us to the moon.  <em>Itâ€™s one of many different potential triggers that could do it.</em></p>
<p>We have a lot of big brains on this sub that compile all kinds of great data, pointing to one potential trigger or another.  Apes get hyped over a particular trigger, and then disappointment follows when that doesnâ€™t happen.</p>
<p>Remember 6/9?  Remember how low so many felt when there were no big announcements or sharing of actual vote counts?  That was a dark day here on this sub, and only because apes got too hyped over one potential trigger.  Letâ€™s not do that over the dividend thing, OK?</p>
<p>Trust the process, and trust RC.  He has our backs.  If they decide to issue a dividend, awesome.  I will be more jacked than ever.  </p>
<p>But if there is no such dividend?  Totally fine.  Because <em>the shorts still have to cover.</em></p>
<p>Mama says HODL! ðŸ¥°</p>
<p>Edit: Iâ€™m not saying not to be hyped.  We should always be hyped.  But donâ€™t get disappointed if one specific thing we are hyped for doesnâ€™t work out.</p>
<p>If the disappointment doesnâ€™t get to you, thatâ€™s awesome.  Keep those diamond hands!  But I saw a lot (and I mean a LOT) of posters here act as if the MOASS was canceled when RC didnâ€™t announce the vote count at the shareholders meetings.  I just donâ€™t want to see anyone get disappointed or feel any FUD if there is no crypto dividend.  There is no need for FUD.  </p>
