Please tell me someone saved “TLC - The Long Con” DD before it got deleted.  Perhaps archived it or as a PDF?

The fact that it got removed says A LOT.  I think the OP hit the nail on the head, exposed the HF’s MM’s.  Exposed the games that they were playing.  It was everything right there. Perhaps it’s the silver bullet, the evidence that can be used to prove naked short selling.

Would like to read it again to understand it more.
