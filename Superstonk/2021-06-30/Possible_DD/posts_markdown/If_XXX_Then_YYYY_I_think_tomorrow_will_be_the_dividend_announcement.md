Ok, so I've been trying to figure out RC's next move. There are some interesting things happening right now.

We have the Etherium coin with a date of July 14th 2021.

That date means something, we are just not sure what the date represents. Is it a day that Gamestop announces a dividend? Or is it the day that a dividend that is released? Or is it just a random date to make the Hedgies sweat?

One of the bases I am working with, and I might be wrong, is that there needs to be at least 10 business days notice between the announcement and the official release of the dividend in question. If some better ape knows that rules on this, please point them out to me, I saw this somewhere but I'm not able to find it again.

If the 14th is the date of the announcement, then obviously nothing is going to happen tomorrow, because nothing will have been announced.

If the 14th is the planned date for the dividend release, then things get interesting.

Going back to my theory of 10 business days between announcement and release, we have to do some quick math. 

Normally, Gamestop would announce on July 4th, which is both a weekend and a national holiday, so they can't. Which means if they are going to announce it, it's happening either July 1st or July 2nd. 

However, the National Holiday throws a kink into this. If July 4th falls on a Sunday, doesn't that make the Monday immediately after or the Friday before (Depending on where you live...) the replacement holiday? Which, if true, means that there is one less business day to work with. 

That means that the 2nd is off the table if they want to make the 10 business days timeline. And if the second is off the table, and they are targeting the July 14th date for the dividend release... then they have to announce the dividend tomorrow on July 1st.

This really falls in line with everything RC has been doing, especially if you look at Furlong, who left Amazon as the head of their Australian operations to take over as Gamestop CEO. Furlong is going to get $16,500,000.00 in Gamestop stock as part of his signing package. And that amount of stock is calculated by the closing price at the end of June, which is today.

So, I think tomorrow should be the day that Gamestop announces the crypto dividend. Which should, if not launch us, at least start the engine.

I don't feel bad for the Hedgies, but our Elliot Waves guy is about to have his mind blown I bet.

If anyone sees a flaw in this logic, please point it out.

**TLDR: If Gamestop is announcing the crypto dividend tomorrow, and they are looking to give 10 business days notice between announce and release, then the announcement has to come tomorrow due to the July 4th holiday carry over.**
