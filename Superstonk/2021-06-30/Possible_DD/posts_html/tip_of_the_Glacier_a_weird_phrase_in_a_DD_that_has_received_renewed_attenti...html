<p>A recent [possible DD] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oapj59/blackrock_addition_to_the_russell_prospectus_cant/) has been doing the rounds recently, resurrecting interest in a curious series of three DD posts, created by an Anonymous user who claims to have just a few months experience, but a penchant for puzzle-solving. However, if you read his insights (and I encourage you to do so), I think it's very likely that this user has some connection to the industry; his clear explanation of shady and complex processes could only be created by somebody with an in-depth understanding of the topics he's discussing. Add that to the sudden disappearance of the user, and the potentially linked revelations to the "Game on Anon" phrase, as identified by /u/3for100Specials, in this post ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxlw8v/a_dd_drop_from_last_weekend_which_predicted_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf ) it all sounds curious, to say the least. </p>
<p>Now, I was inspired to give <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8t9n/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_3/">the /u/leavemeanon threads</a> a revisit as a result of /u/SPAClivesmatter's post. I read the entire thing, word-by-word, to attempt to glean additional insight into the character of /u/leavemeanon and the saga we're all patiently watch unfold.</p>
<p>In Part 1 and Part 2 of the three-part DD, /u/leavemeanon uses the phrase "tip of the Glacier" to describe the magnitude of the events he's describing. This is unusual for three reasons:</p>
<p>1) The commonly used phrase is "tip of the iceberg": On a quick search, I cannot find the "glacier" variant to be an accepted alteration ANYWHERE. I mean, it's close enough to iceberg that we can understand what he's trying to say, but isn't it strange that he's effectively created a new phrase in a post that otherwise doesn't appear to contain unusual/cryptic styles of writing (in fact, the OP has gone out of his way to explain everything in a very clear way). </p>
<p>2) He uses the phrase TWICE -- the second time in <strong>bold</strong>: please refer to the screenshots of <a href="http://prntscr.com/17mqf58">DD number 1</a> and <a href="http://prntscr.com/17mqnmt">DD number 2</a>. He doubles-down on his unusual phrase, almost purposely bringing attention to it in Part 2.</p>
<p>3) The "Glacier" is a capital letter: OP would have made a conscious decision to not only use the Glacier variant of the phrase (that may not even exist), but also spell the out-of-place phrase with a capital letter. To me, this is the clearest evidence that /u/leavemeanon is making some kind of reference to another event that popped up on this sub a few months ago (and apes who have been here a while already know exactly what I'm referring to at this point).</p>
<p>The apes who have been following this saga for a while will remember there were articles going around about a mysterious "Glacier Capital" in March, a financial "black box" institution that supposedly shorted GME at $167 and made a public statement advertising as such. There was a lot of speculation about what exactly Glacier Capital was: whether the whole story was FUD setting us up for a fake-squeeze, among others. The topic was discussed, debated, and eventually disappeared with a general sense that it was just another weird plot point on the increasingly weird tapestry that the GME story is weaving.</p>
<p>With /u/leavemeanon's DD receiving a new wave of attention recently, I just wanted to leave this speculation out there as a possibility that the Glacier Capital story may be also worth a revisit. If apes with more wrinkles than I determine it's all a big co-incidence, then that is okay with me, but I believe this subreddit is at its best when it's a transparent forum where people can raise interesting points and have them investigated or debunked by a collective pool of individuals.</p>
