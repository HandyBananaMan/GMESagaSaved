<p>GAMESTOP i have heard from Dr Trimbath, Wes Christian, and Lucy Komisar that all of this will really only end with you.  All 3 of these experts have stated that you and only you as the company can fix this.  There is little i can do as investors to fix the synthetic shares that have flooded the market.  I am buying more and Hodling, but the people manipulating the system have bags of tricks and loads of money that they can use to screw us investors.</p>
<p>Dr Trimbath did a recent interview stating again that you are the only one who can fix it.  She stated that you accepted your proxy vote because you got the results you wanted even though there were tons of your investors who complained that they did not get to vote along with the high likelihood of a huge overvote tally.  You could have easily stated that you would reject the vote because of investors not being able to vote and that you recieved way to many votes, but you elected to accept them.  </p>
<p>I still have trust in GAMESTOP and its management.  I am very excited in the direction the company is headed!  I really like the Stonk!  But I am sick and tired of the manipulations going on as investors!  And I am counting on you to remedy these manipulations soon for the sake of your company and your investors.  </p>
<p>I am patiently waiting on a statement to your investors on the matters of why lots of investors did not get to vote (manly EU and UK), what the total number of votes was, if there were to many votes, and what is going on with the SEC investigation.  </p>
<p>I have stood by you through thick and then, and all came to the rescue when things were looking grim.  You have teased me with your tweets and replies, but now is the time to let me as an investors know that you have my back </p>

<p>Edit:  sorry for putting we, as I was speaking for everyone.  This was wrong of me and I am sorry for doing this.  I have edited my post and changed to I to reflect this as my personal opinions.</p>
<p>Note:  this is by no means intended to be fud!  I'm all in as I really like the stock and the direction its headed, just tired of it getting manipulated down below what I think its true value is.  All these experts have stated it will take gamestop to fix this and I have faith they will!!!  </p>
<p>Note 2:  thanks for apes who stated it was good for them to accept vote so Cohen got ceo and new board.  Now they can get to work!!!  Makes me feel better as to why they didn't reject it!!!</p>
