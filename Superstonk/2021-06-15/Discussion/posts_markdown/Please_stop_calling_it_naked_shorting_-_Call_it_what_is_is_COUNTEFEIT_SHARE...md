I know we've all gotten used to the term "naked shorting", but we all know what it really is: Counterfeit shares.

Instead of talking about "naked shorting", "synthetic longs" and "delivery times", try having a conversation and just say "Hedge funds are making millions of counterfeit share certificates every day. And the SEC (the financial police) KNOW THIS and does nothing to stop it. What a scam, huh?"
