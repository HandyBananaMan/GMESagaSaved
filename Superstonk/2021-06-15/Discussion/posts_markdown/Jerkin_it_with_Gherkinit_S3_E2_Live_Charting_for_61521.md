Good Morning Superstonk!

Yesterday was a strange day to say the least, GME had decent volume but almost no price action as we dipped traded sideways and then came up a bit before close. The SPY did one of the hardest rips before close I've seen, the bond markets slipped, and corporate junk bonds are having pretty erratic movement as well. Michael Burry pops up and drops and FBI surveillance van on his twitter... It's definitely gonna be a weird week. Oh, and quadruple witching on Friday. Remember as we go into today hodl tight, cause this is a bumpy ride.

# After Market Wrap

So that was an interesting day closing down 3.22% from yesterday. Hopefully we see some price action tomorrow and now more of this down all day up before close nonsense as apparently DTCC-005 is now filed we could have an interesting Wednesday. Thank you all for tuning in and for all the support. See you tomorrow morning at 9am.

Failed test of VWAP GME came down with the market at open, negative beta doesn't mean inverse to the market, failed test of VWAP maybe looking at some lower volume chop now

# Pre-Market Analysis

Volume this morning is about half of what it was yesterday at 43k. It's very possible with all the things happening in the rest of the market we may have a pretty low day for GME. Looks like we have a fill up to 230 possibly before open 1.1M Shares available to borrow.
