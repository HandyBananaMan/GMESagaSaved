    "selftext": "Good Morning Superstonk!\n\nYesterday was a strange day to say the least, GME had decent volume but almost no price action as we dipped traded sideways and then came up a bit before close. The SPY did one of the hardest rips before close I've seen, the bond markets slipped, and corporate junk bonds are having pretty erratic movement as well. Michael Burry pops up and drops and FBI surveillance van on his twitter... It's definitely gonna be a weird week. Oh, and quadruple witching on Friday. Remember as we go into today hodl tight, cause this is a bumpy ride.\n\nIf you guys haven't had a chance to [Check out this weeks forward looking TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nz1x01/jerkin_it_with_gherkinit_forward_looking_ta_for/)\n\nJoin us in the Daily Livestream [https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial](https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial)\n\nOr listen along with our live audio feed on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HbqnUVsSrH)\n\n(save these links in case reddit goes down)\n\nHistorical Resistance/Support:\n\n116.5, 125.5, 132.5, 141, 145, 147.5, 150, 152.5, **157**, 158.5, 162.5, 163, 165.5, 172, 174, 176.5, 179, 180.5, 182, 183.5, 184.5, 186, 187.5, 190.5, 192, 195, 196.5, 197.5, 200, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, 226, 232.5, 235, 242.5, 250, 255, 262.5, 275, 285, 300, 302.50, 310, 317.50, 325, 332.5, 345, 350, moon base...\n\n# After Market Wrap\n\nSo that was an interesting day closing down 3.22% from yesterday. Hopefully we see some price action tomorrow and now more of this down all day up before close nonsense as apparently DTCC-005 is now filed we could have an interesting Wednesday. Thank you all for tuning in and for all the support.

It's very possible with all the things happening in the rest of the market we may have a pretty low day for GME. Looks like we have a fill up to 230 possibly before open 1.1M Shares available to borrow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pe6xf2vaf571.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=97ceb815f1fe52e7f099cd06fdd2e4aff0a0306e\n\n*\\* Although my profession is day trading, I in no way endorse day-trading of GME not only does it present significant risk, it can delay the squeeze.*\n\n*\\*My YouTube channel is \"monetized\" if that is something you are uncomfortable with, I understand, while I wouldn't say I profit greatly from the views, I do suggest you use ad-block when viewing it if you feel so compelled.* *My intention is simply benefit this community.
