<p>Sounds like that might explain those new rehypothecation accounts Goldman suddenly has... But this could also be a sign that 005 isn't everything investors have been thinking it would be.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Update: Seeing lots of wrinkle brains saying #005 could still be tit-jacking, just might be plausible deniability after their lack of enforcement may have destroyed the world economy.  Basically clarifying the rules they've been ignoring, and saying "ok we will enforce them now".</p>

<h1>Worth Repeating- We Just Like the Stock!!</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/9g82ltqmlh571.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b461af036d5ce9c3da97a20d8a01e8764014fa6</p>
<p>There has been a lot of conversation (FUD) over the weekend about "Fuck you, pay me" and referring to being involved with trading $GME simply because you want to become rich and purely to trigger MOASS. Or because "we're Occupy Wall St. 2.0!" (<strong>NO</strong>).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>THESE ARE NOT THE PURPOSE, INTENT, OR COLLECTIVE SENTIMENT OF THIS SUBREDDIT.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/3kpf14lnlh571.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8782761d730c8f40a8f25ef9ddffed31c3b6d9b</p>
<p>Superstonk is a community of individual investors that believe Gamestop as a company is an excellent long-term investment that has huge potential in an untapped market with an Avengers-level team of executives that will likely redefine the face of retail in the 21st century. This community was <strong>not</strong> made to discuss other stocks the way /WSB or /investing do. This sub is a congregation of individuals- in that sense, a collective "we or us"- that supports the vision of the company Gamestop long-term, especially its current chairman, Ryan Cohen. We like the company. We like the stock. That's it.</p>
<p>And a little refresher on the we/us debate- <strong>WHEN WE SAY "WE OR US", WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SUB'S COLLECTIVE WE/US AS A COMMUNITY.</strong> There is nothing wrong with that!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/gcgti8yolh571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8194c5c15d9225b88e5ff6a6bf603cedf7574e58</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Use of the words We/Us are NOT EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULATION.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Enforcement is the <em>key</em> to a manipulation case. Do we make paper hands actually pay some sort of penance for selling? <strong>NO</strong>. Do we have an agreed upon floor price that we all must adhere to? <strong>Umm..... :gestures broadly at literally everyone debating possible floor price:</strong></p>
<p>Market manipulation is doing something to inflate or deflate the price of a stock. THESE are the ESTABLISHED GROUNDS for charging someone with market manipulation. And do you know how many times that's happened? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n22g01/breakdown_of_legalese_to_speak_part_5_market/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Like 5 times. And they were all people in the industry.</a></p>
<p>There's no case for market manipulation in this subreddit, or even in the GME Saga as a whole.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Well, I lied. Hedgies are doing plenty.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So when you see people referring to "we" or "us", <em>they aren't doing anything wrong.</em> This is a community, right? Everyone here isn't just a figment of your imagination right? <strong>(RIGHT?!?)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zycjeejklh571.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07af020341a84d13ee318088231183cfe4cb4e07">Y'all aren't imaginary, right?</a></p>
<p>We are a community of individually-minded investors. And no one can stop us from liking and discussing a stock. That's what they want you to think. <strong>Saying "we" or "us" when talking about Superstonk is just talking about the membership of this subreddit.</strong> There is nothing there that's illegal or negative in and of itself. All "we" do is gather here and discuss the future of a company we all love and have invested in because we believe in the future of the leadership.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What's the difference between our sub and the idea dinners the rich have been attending for decades? <em>The expense report</em>. Do you remember when American Politicians used insider information about the pandemic to profit off of the resulting crash? <strong>APES REMEMBER</strong>. Don't let FUD stop you from bonding with your fellow ape. Companionship is essential to the human experience. Get in here and love each other. It's Woodstonk 2021 up in here✌💖🌼☮</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With that being said, <strong>WE HAVE NO LEADER HERE</strong>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/">r/Superstonk</a> has administrative users that moderate the community according to site rules. That's it! When it comes to leaders, mods are just the administrators of the environment. The groundskeepers in this beautiful jungle. This community was built by apes, for apes. With no one user more important than the other. <strong>APE</strong>= <strong>A</strong>ll <strong>P</strong>eople <strong>E</strong>qual ✊ No politics. No religion. No leaders. No divisiveness. Just excellence and the stock we love.</p>

<p><strong>Here's a few notes from</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/">u/redchessqueen99</a>'s <strong>Weekend Update</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Please view the DISCLAIMER associated with the subreddit. You can access it by going to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/">r/Superstonk</a> and (on Desktop) looking at the side bar, and (on Mobile) under the About menu.</li>
<li>We do not manipulate the market. We do not coordinate anything regarding the stock market. We do not urge people to buy or sell, or do anything with what is their privately owned stock. We do not shame people for their choices as retail investors, in an attempt to get them to hold when they don't want to, or to buy GME when they'd rather buy something else. We let retail investors make their own individual decisions. That's sub policy.</li>
<li>We do not organize or attempt to push political action, or spark Occupy Wall Street 2.0 or whatever some of you think this is. We are not going to organize letters to the SEC or otherwise enter ourselves into a political arena that we, trust me, do not want to enter. We are a bunch of apes who are bananas for GameStop and that's about it.</li>
<li>We are here to share information, build a community, and express ourselves regarding GameStop as not just a stock, but also as a company, in way that is not pressuring or purposefully influential, and is based on fundamentals as well as market realities. If you don't want to talk about GameStop, there are plenty of other subs to go to, and, if you talk about GameStop, make sure you follow the rules and guidelines of the sub.</li>
<li>TL;DR: We like the stock. We love the company. We are apes. That's about it.</li>
