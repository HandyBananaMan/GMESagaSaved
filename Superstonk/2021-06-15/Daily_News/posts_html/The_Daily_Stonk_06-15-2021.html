<p>Good Morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole and this is your daily news.</p>
<p>Does anyone smell that?</p>
<p>*insert flashy intro card*</p>

<p>First of all the high score of the day</p>

<p>Reverse Repo is currently sitting at 583 billion, breaking ATH for every day for the past week.</p>
<p>there is a lot of info in the comments of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nzrtvz/daily_reverse_repo_update_0614_583892_b_new_record/">this thread</a>, go out and read a bit, perhaps you can add to the conversation and grow a collective wrinkle!</p>
<h1>The exponential floor</h1>

<p>made by  u/JTH1 and his thread is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nzvj68/0614_update_did_share_dilution_shift_the_floor/">here</a></p>
<p>We don't know why the floor is currently not being followed, this could be for several different reasons, it could be a statistical outlier/anomaly, or possible that they are currently offering shares and this dilution can cause the statistic offset or something else entirely.</p>
<p>Regardless of what it is I'd love to know because this seemed to hold up significantly up until end of last week.</p>

<h1>Cassandra of Greek mythology is back.</h1>
<p>Cassandra was astonishingly beautiful and blessed with the gift of foreseeing the future. Her curse was that no one believed her, a fact that weighed heavily on the destruction of Troy during the Trojan War.</p>
<p>Just like Dr. Burry foretold the crash of 2008 and in some ways the crash to come (DD on this is to follow soon), he was told by the SEC that he could no longer use twitter anymore and was offline for months. but it seems now that Gary Gensler is finally at the helm he was allowed to go back online.</p>
<p>Can't wait what this man has to say.</p>

<h1>An update on our favorite missing rule, SR-DTC-2021-005</h1>
<p>Lots of people have been filing a FOIA (freedom of information act) questions into the 005, I'd say keep going guys show them you've not forgotten.</p>
<p>This got delisted in march and would've been back shortly.... fast forward 3 months later and it's still not here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Interviews and such</h1>
<p>Now onto a little bit of the beat and path.</p>
<p>As many of you have undoubtedly have seen by now MSM is stepping up their game, and even though I like how some of them finally report on GME and other stocks this does not mean I trust them.</p>
<p>The same goes for influencers or streamers who suddenly are accepting interviews on MSM for clout, so let me be clear about this from the get go, r/Superstonk has no leaders, we don't have a spokesperson and we do not do interviews until after the squeeze.</p>
<p>This is for a variety of reasons, but ones that are prevalent for me are simple:</p>
<p>1-This is a round table, all apes are equal and would not dare to speak for anyone </p>
<p>2- they'll most likely look for "gotcha" moments to try and hurt us and others</p>
<p>3- we can only speak for personal experiences not for others</p>
<p>4- and most likely the best reason why I wouldn't do any interviews (see image)</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
<p>If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.</p>
