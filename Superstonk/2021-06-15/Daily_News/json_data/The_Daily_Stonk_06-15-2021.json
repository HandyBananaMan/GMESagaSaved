Her curse was that no one believed her, a fact that weighed heavily on the destruction of Troy during the Trojan War.\n\nJust like Dr. Burry foretold the crash of 2008 and in some ways the crash to come (DD on this is to follow soon), he was told by the SEC that he could no longer use twitter anymore and was offline for months. but it seems now that Gary Gensler is finally at the helm he was allowed to go back online.\n\nCan't wait what this man has to say.\n\n#  Ford Equity Research UPGRADES $GME from HODL to BUY. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzngh5ni8e571.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c6f520dbe2c06d6ec1439f768005e553ab2ec86\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1m7km38j8e571.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=81511139cebafb286e9244aa6ce1280d8d043ab0\n\n# Some people to look out for\n\n thanks to u/zedinstead for compiling this list.\n\nExponential Floor guy \u2013 u/JTH1\n\nElliot Waves guy \u2013 u/possibly6\n\nTrading Sideways guy -
