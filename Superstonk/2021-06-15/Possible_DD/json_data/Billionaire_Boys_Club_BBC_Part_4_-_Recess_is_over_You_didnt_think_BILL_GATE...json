Some of the information in this Volume of BBC comes through unverified sources. I have used source links where possible, but the sources referenced may have their own Agenda in what they are saying that I can't account for. In saying that... They are mainly referenced to detail my journey, which leads to verified credible sources.\n\n**ALSO...** I am not actually going to claim that anyone did anything, merely just connect some dots and let you form your own opinion.\n\n**ALSO...** This is not financial advice, I am not financially qualified, and full disclosure I am a $GME shareholder.\n\n**ALSO...** this post is an introductory post to BBC part 5. I'm working on more connections to $GME, and this is part of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that that's out of the way...\n\nLet's dive in. Shits getting Dark Apes. (But no surprises there)\n\nSo we all know that Billionaires love to count themselves as Philatropists right?\n\nThis is the ONE thing, nearly all of them have in common.\n\nSo since I was looking for connections between all these guys for the BBC, I decided to look at what they all had in common.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm not American, so I am not up to date on the School System, but as I'm sure many of you are, I'm guessing you know a little about Charter Schools?\n\nBut again... I'll try to stay out of Pol itics, though a lot of this will hover around the subject.\n\nSo on looking into these Billionaires and their Philanthropy... I discovered that ALOT of them were keenly interested in Charter Schools.\n\n(Don't worry, I will look at the other stuff, but up first is Education)\n\nANYWAY...\n\nI started down my path for curiosity to see if I could uncover why the Super Rich are so interested in these schools and \"Reforming\" education.\n\nI'm sure many of you see this as a worthy endeavor. The school system needs reform as it's severely underfunded right?\n\n# Let's start with WHY\n\nMy first stop into this DARK CAVE was a little Infographic I found on Facebook... Claiming that the High Cost of Oaklands Charter Schools were financially impacting the Public School sector by $57 million net loss...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xf9dzfzj6g571.png?width=1668&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca106768b8448950cf274299aca84de1b89d574f\n\nSource: [https://www.facebook.com/OaklandEA/photos/a.10150107486279627/10156853628859627/?type=3&theater](https://www.facebook.com/OaklandEA/photos/a.10150107486279627/10156853628859627/?type=3&theater)\n\nBu this could be explained away and my source can not be verified. So I carried on searching.\n\n**NEXT UP**\n\nI come across an article discussing **Why Billionaires Love Charter Schools**\n\nThis article goes into detail about the 2 main reasons Billionaires love charters...\n\nTINFOIL HAT TIME\n\nInvesting in these schools allows them to 1. Avoid Taxes and 2. Disrupt Unions.\n\nYup... Anti-Union Conspiracy theory. Maybe it makes sense? I don't know to be honest. (I'll let you make up your own mind)\n\nBut Avoiding Taxes...\n\nNow that's a language I can see the Hedgies speaking.\n\nSource: [https://eastbaymajority.com/why-billionaires-love-charter-schools/](https://eastbaymajority.com/why-billionaires-love-charter-schools/)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo I continue down further into the Cave...\n\nIt's getting Dark now, and my light is Dim.\n\nI find more and more of these types of articles, hypothesizing different reasons behind the love for Charter Schools...\n\nSome of it may have merit... Some of it may be fluff... I'm not expert.\n\nBut I continue to follow the MONEY breadcrumbs.\n\nBefore I go there though...\n\nI just wanted to reintroduce our Friend \"Milky\" Milken\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yeb9uf078g571.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa4029d7e1c920593ffa63a0e1920976d3e7d5b5\n\nAnd another SUPERSTONK favorite...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqr9lqji8g571.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef764218506532a1dc0f42a2748c3700fd3d4e2c\n\nYep... Mr Bill gates... NOW... DISCLAIMER... I'm a nerd and love computers and have looked up to old Billy since I was a kid. I honestly respect him until proven otherwise.\n\nBut he does come into play here.\n\nI was looking into WHO actually invests in these Charter Schools and I came across this article...\n\n**GOT DOUGH? HOW BILLIONAIRES RULE OUR SCHOOLS.**\n\nNow this article is in a pretty reputable Magazine, with high domain authority, readership and traffic.\n\n(BUT AGAIN... I have not verified this magazines Agenda)\n\nThe article details the ongoing campaigns of Billionaires to pump 100s of millions into these schools.\n\nThe 3 BIGGEST of these are:\n\n* The Bill and Linda Gates Foundation\n* The Broad Foundation\n* The Walton Family Foundation\n\nWe will get into this in more detail shortly... BUT... BOMB DROP TIME...\n\n***(A bigger bomb is coming)***\n\nGive a guess who else was listed in this article?\n\nFUCKING MILKEN... They didn't even call him by his full name and listed him in a bunch of other names... so much so that if you were skimming the article and not paying attention... you would have missed it.\n\n*\"And they fund the same vehicles to achieve their goals: charter schools, high-stakes standardized testing for students, merit pay for teachers whose students improve their test scores, firing teachers and closing schools when scores don\u2019t rise adequately, and longitudinal data collection on the performance of every student and teacher. Other foundations\u2014Ford, Hewlett, Annenberg,* ***Milken***\\*, to name just a few\u2014often join in funding one project or another\"\\*\n\nSo DOT CONNECTED... we now have a common interest between Milken and Gates.\n\n(The common Interest between Gates and Kenny... is ALOT more substantial)\n\nSOURCE: [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/got-dough-how-billionaires-rule-our-schools](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/got-dough-how-billionaires-rule-our-schools)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**NOW...

A substantial share of public expenditure intended for the delivery of direct educational services to children is being extracted inadvertently or intentionally for personal or business financial gain, creating substantial inefficiencies;\n2. Public assets are being unnecessarily transferred to private hands, at public expense, risking the future provision of \u201cpublic\u201d education;\n3. Charter school operators are growing highly endogenous, self-serving private entities built on funds derived from lucrative management fees and rent extraction which further compromise the future provision of \u201cpublic\u201d education; and\n4. Current disclosure requirements make it unlikely that any related legal violations, ethical concerns, or merely bad policies and practices are not realized until clever investigative reporting, whistleblowers or litigation brings them to light.\u00a0\n\nSOURCE: [https://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/charter-revenue](https://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/charter-revenue)\n\n\\-- I haven't gone through it all, as it's 56 pages long and I have other fish to fry, but it seems legit.
