<p>I could type my whole story here since 7 Jan. Sold NONE, high xxxx holder.</p>
<p>For new holders remember THIS IS NOTHING, no tiddybitty dip. We saw short ladder attacks making 350$ EOD at under 140 within 5 FIVE! minutes.</p>
<p>January Halted, breaks as normal, shorted from 480$ to 220 within 30 minutes! Then next day 300$ then next 55$ then down to 40$</p>
<p>LET ME PUT THIS IN MONEY:
30k 60k, 240k, 510k BACK DOWN TO 42k, SOLD ZERO!</p>
<p>This is a 18k dip today, and my pulse hasn't changed.</p>
<p>Stay true to fundamentals 800-2200$ Minimum WITHOUT squeeze, that's just icing in the cake!
Yes, it will squeeze, just be Patient, burry waited over a year.</p>
<p>Dfw waited over a year now.</p>
<p>You have it easier than us holding since december-Start Jan. We had to go through all shorts of fud.

<p>All I know, I am still up about 1000% so why the... SELL NOW? THAT WOULD BE THE UTTERMOST IDIOTIC THING TO DO.
Like playing a game for days, to stop and sell the game when you are at the end boss.</p>
