As the title says, this one goes out to all the shills in the rafters.

Any non-disclosure agreement is null and void if it is used to cover up illegal activity (such as active market manipulation).

The SEC is offering quite handsome rewards for whistleblowers.

Under the SEC Whistleblower Program, the SEC is required to pay awards to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the SEC with original information that leads to a successful enforcement action resulting in monetary sanctions in excess of $1 million.

So why get paid pennies on the $ for browsing reddit spreading FUD, when you could just be browsing reddit, but in your very own mansion?
