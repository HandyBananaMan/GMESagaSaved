<p>Dozens of apes were just doxxed in the new DTCC filing. If your email appears in that filing after page 42 I'd highly recommend you do these two things at the very least:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update your current email password.</li>
<li>Make a new email through an encrypted service such as Protonmail, and re-link your brokerage accounts to it just in case.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for some added security, if these features are offered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify your backup email</li>
<li>Enable 2FA  / MFA</li>
</ul>
<p>Emails can be linked to other breached datasets and apes could be targeted after the squeeze. The information in that filing is now public. Be careful out there.</p>
