If your email appears in that filing after page 42 I'd highly recommend you do these two things at the very least:\n\n - Update your current email password.\n - Make a new email through an encrypted service such as Protonmail, and re-link your brokerage accounts to it just in case.\n\nAnd for some added security, if these features are offered:\n\n- Verify your backup email\n- Enable 2FA  / MFA\n\nEmails can be linked to other breached datasets and apes could be targeted after the squeeze. The information in that filing is now public. Be careful out there.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: I'm referring to https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-005.pdf\n\nStarting on page 42",
