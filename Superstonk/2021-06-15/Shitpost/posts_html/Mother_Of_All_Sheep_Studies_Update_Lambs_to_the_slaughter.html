<p><strong>Good Morning (Bore da) from Wales!</strong></p>
<p>I've been away for a few days but had to call short my holiday because so many apes were requesting sheep movement updates.</p>
<p>I kept a passing interest in the GME ticker whilst away but I've long since learned that without a clear line of sight to the sheep I'm as clueless as the next ape, and just as clueless as our wrinkly brained super apes with their fancy graphs, numberology and acronym fetishes.</p>
<p><strong>Sour GrAPE?</strong> I note that u/rensole neglected to add me to the list of apes to keep an eye on in todays daily news. Rensole was clearly keen not to over burden apes with overly complex DD, since his list included basic quant and exponential curve ideas - but I think it's important apes get the real meat, the real lamb and the chance to at least try and grow some wrinkles.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: My field work can be relied upon to inform your financial decisions, if that is your thing. I am not a sheep and will never pull the wool over your eyes.  <strong>This DD builds on my magnum opus:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkpmnv/mother_of_all_sheep_studies_1_2_and_3_my_magnum/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkpmnv/mother_of_all_sheep_studies_1_2_and_3_my_magnum/</a></p>

<p><strong>It's almost time for the spring lambs to be sent to market</strong> - as such they are quite literally 'lambs to the slaughter' and when that day comes it will be a bullish signal of MOASS, since GME has a negative beta correlation to OLV (Operating Lamb volume). A reminder that negative beta tells us what has happened, not what will happen - so no mint sauce until market day.</p>

<p><strong>Short Grass has not been covered -</strong> We've enjoyed a spell of hot weather and that has exposed farmer Gryff Gryffyn's less than cunning plan to hide the short grass OTM (On the moor). Said moorland is becoming parched and the shorter grass is rapidly becoming ungrazebale , to such an extent that it may not even be mowed, or 'trimmed' on the usual T-21 cycle. Sheep are thus grazing on longer grass and farmer Gryffyn can be seen frantically laying synthetic turf on the more exposed areas of the field. <strong>Desperate Stuff, and Bullish.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 cubic metres of straw dumped in field -</strong> for the last few days a tractor has been tipping regular quantities of straw into the feeders in the upper field, totalling approx 5 cubic metres (or 5 million pieces of straw in old language).</p>
<p><strong><em>This has had two effects:</em></strong> Firstly the straw suppresses the long grass around the feeders as the sheep converge to feed on it. Secondly, the straw leads to sideways grazing, as sheep move from their usually more volatile behaviours to a carefully orchestrated rotation between straw feeder and traditional grazing.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> I've been asked to share my analysis of the impact of RC Float Tweet on 25 May, so I've included that below. If any quant apes want to go deeper, I'll send you the files.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Silence of the lambs is <strong>imminent</strong></li>
<li>Straw dumping now finished, <strong>expect more volatility</strong> in days ahead</li>
<li><strong>Short grass is naked</strong> and getting burned</li>
<li><strong>BAA volume highest after hours</strong>, as dusk falls * BAA stands for 'Bleating Animal Audio' and is used by experts in this field to measure the total number of sheep grazing at any given moment.</li>
</ul>
