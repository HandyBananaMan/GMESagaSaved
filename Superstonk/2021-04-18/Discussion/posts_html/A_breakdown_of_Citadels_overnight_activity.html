<p>Last night, Citadel worked through the night. Their phone traffic started ~1 hour before crypto crashed (no comment on that yet, just noting timing). They kept going, phone traffic increased enough that people drove to verify indeed lights were on. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt4j8w/shitadel_hq_oddly_busy_right_now_on_a_weekend/">This started the discussion, their phone traffic showed them at work</a> middle of the night Saturday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt85ej/google_says_there_is_more_activity_at_citadel_hq/">Then traffic kept increasing</a></p>
<p>When the phones were posted increasing, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt85ej/google_says_there_is_more_activity_at_citadel_hq/guy5001?utm_source=share&amp;context=3">a guy decided to drive</a> to drone record it... <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt8m63/mission_chimpossible/">look at citadels building at 4 AM all lit up</a> this morning</p>
<p>TLDR; <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ct5OjZdehZU">OP above record this video</a> and one more.  Lights on at the top, phones busy on Google so...</p>
<p>They got caught, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt9ycy/shitadel_got_caught_working_late_now_open_for_24/">they removed their hours so you can't see when they are working (which is measured by phone traffic)</a></p>
