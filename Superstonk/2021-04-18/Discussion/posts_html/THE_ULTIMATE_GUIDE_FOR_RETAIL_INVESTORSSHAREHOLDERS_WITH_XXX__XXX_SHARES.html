<p>The market has always prided itself on being every-man-for-himself. Apes? Apes make sure everyone gets their ticket's worth on the way to the moon. I don't need $100 million. I want 100 people to have $1 million.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>HODL for the person who scraped enough to get just one share.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>HODL for the people who have been a victim of a broken, unjust financial system.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>HODL to show that the 99% are to be fucked with no more.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>HODL to ensure the financial inequality in the world is re-balanced.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>HODL to make the world a better place.</em></strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Support a company. Like the stock.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can't stop. Won't stop. GameStop.</strong></p>

<p>Edit - changed 'we' to '99%'. I didn't see a problem with it. Someone else did.</p>
