# MY DEAR APES.

# Please follow the corresponding guide respective of your share quantity:

* **X shares - Hodl until the millions.**

&#x200B;

* **XX shares - Hodl for the X shareholders.**

&#x200B;

* **XXX - Hodl for the X and XX shareholders.**

&#x200B;

* **XXXX - Hodl for everyone.** ***(You mini whales)***

&#x200B;

The market has always prided itself on being every-man-for-himself. Apes? Apes make sure everyone gets their ticket's worth on the way to the moon. I don't need $100 million. I want 100 people to have $1 million.

&#x200B;

***HODL for the person who scraped enough to get just one share.***

***HODL for the people who have been a victim of a broken, unjust financial system.***

***HODL to show that the 99% are to be fucked with no more.***

***HODL to ensure the financial inequality in the world is re-balanced.***

***HODL to make the world a better place.***

&#x200B;

**Support a company. Like the stock.**

**Can't stop. Won't stop. GameStop.**

Edit - changed 'we' to '99%'. I didn't see a problem with it. Someone else did.
