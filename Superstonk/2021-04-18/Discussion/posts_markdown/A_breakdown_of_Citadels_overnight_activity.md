Last night, Citadel worked through the night. Their phone traffic started ~1 hour before crypto crashed (no comment on that yet, just noting timing). They kept going, phone traffic increased enough that people drove to verify indeed lights were on. 

[This started the discussion, their phone traffic showed them at work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt4j8w/shitadel_hq_oddly_busy_right_now_on_a_weekend/) middle of the night Saturday.


[Then traffic kept increasing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt85ej/google_says_there_is_more_activity_at_citadel_hq/)

When the phones were posted increasing, [a guy decided to drive](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt85ej/google_says_there_is_more_activity_at_citadel_hq/guy5001?utm_source=share&context=3) to drone record it... [look at citadels building at 4 AM all lit up](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt8m63/mission_chimpossible/) this morning

TLDR; [OP above record this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ct5OjZdehZU) and one more.  Lights on at the top, phones busy on Google so...


They got caught, [they removed their hours so you can't see when they are working (which is measured by phone traffic)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt9ycy/shitadel_got_caught_working_late_now_open_for_24/)


Then *a second person* [went to verify it, lights on indeed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt9jno/420am_at_shitadel_headquarters/)

A [hotel near also verified it was lit up](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt91xx/the_entire_citadel_building_is_glowing_at_430_am/)

Later [confirmation Kenny boy worked til almost sun up](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtddmi/confirmed_32_floor_is_ken_griffins_shitadel_lower/) at a minimum if that post was fresh.
