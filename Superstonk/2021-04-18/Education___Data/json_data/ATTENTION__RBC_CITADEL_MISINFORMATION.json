(the \u201cReference Stock Issuer\u201d). The Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, will pay a quarterly Contingent Coupon at the rate and under the circumstances specified below, and will have the terms described in the documents described above, as supplemented or modified by this pricing supplement. \"**\n\n*Pls wrinkle boy, smooth brain much. Need simp answer.*\n\nBasically, RBC is just doing business as usual. Everyone is on the egde of their seat with **4 major banks selling off $47 BILLION in assets** ^((BofA: $15B, JPM: $13B, GS: 10.5B, MS: 8.5B)) so this is getting way more traction than it normally would. Everyone is digging very fucking deep & hard to find connections that aren't there in order to scream Armageddon & watch the universe fucking implode on Monday. RBC will open @ \\~$94 Monday as per usual, and if it doesn't, well, this post is far from the first thing you need to start worrying about.\n\n**WHAT IS WIERD** is that Citadel just closed out \\~30k in options on Toll Brothers Inc. early. hmmm\n\n# PART 3.1 - THE COUNTER-COUNTER DD\n\nCheck out this comment from u/SmithEchoes:\n\n\"So.. if the trade date was March 29, 2021, next coupon barrier date not until the next quarter, and a call date no earlier then September 29, 2021, how exactly is the trigger price of 33.75 activated on April 16, 2021?\n\nThe problem here is this is a 424B2 filing, which is a newly opened prospectus filing. Since it is newly opened, it can\u2019t for the above mentioned reasons be the cause of the 33.75 AH price. Next we have initial stock price, which is for Toll Brothers, Inc (TOL), which on 3/29/21 (trade date) ranged from 55.96 to 59.52. 56.25 lines up pretty well with the VWAP ending normal trading hours, and maintains a conservative price in the benefit to the bank.\n\nSo in real conclusions to the conclusions here, a random \u201cAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier Notes\u201d form 242B2 with a trigger price of 33.75 for TOL stock does not relate to a random after hours RY stock price.\"\n\n**I, like most of you, are also learning most of all this financial jumbo over the past few months. So, lets do our own DD again. Time to dive deeper into Auto-Callable Notes & Prospectus Filings.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TLCR: Prospectus Filings are just a financial document to disclose or describe trades.](https://preview.redd.it/91k4caiysyt61.png?width=483&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed696ce9a98d4b99eff0333cf74ed738e696ccc3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Taken from the RBC Prospectus Filing](https://preview.redd.it/rgg92ts6vyt61.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea608c7becd330eef9e38a0c2eeede7615b7104)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[qwik mafs](https://preview.redd.it/qbbmes8ruyt61.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdf9137939bbbcc1fd8b08055f46e3713b9206bd)\n\nOkay. So the numbers line up with my 3.0 explanation for apes. But what about Callable Fixed Rate Notes? Well, here's an explanation from RBC themselves:  [Callable Fixed Rate Notes](https://www.rbccm.com/assets/rbccm/docs/expertise/fixed-income/us/rbc-callable-fixed-rate-notes-fact-sheet.pdf) (TLCR: They are call options)\n\n*Q: What do we know about call options?* \" **A: For most profitable covered call positions, it is best to let them ride until expiration.** (in this case that would be until AT LEAST September 2021. However, There is nothing in the RBC Prospectus filing that states they can not be closed our PRIOR to that. Which is what Citadel did) **But in certain circumstances it may make sense to close out the trades early to manage risk or free up capital for new opportunities. Always pay attention to transaction costs, and use a limit order when closing out your option contracts. \"**\n\nWait. A. Mother. Fucking. Second.\n\n***\"...it may make sense to close out the trades early to manage risk or free up capital for new opportunities...\"***\n\nWell, I think we just stumbled upon something that was in front of our eyes the whole time.\n\n***Citadel is likely closing out as many positions as it can in order to liquify assets so it has more cash in hand.***\n\nAnd if they're willing to liquify a meager \\~30k in options, it looks like MAY BE\\* liquifying basically fucking everything they have that isn't critical to their operations. (MY OPINION, PURE SPECULATION)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 3.1 TLDR: 3.0 Still stands, also Shitadel looks like it's 300% fuk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PART 4 - CONCLUSION\n\nSomething big is happening, but RBC is fine as far as we can tell with the information on hand.\n\nExpect another post from me within a few days tackling another bullshit lazy dd.\n\n**This kind of misinformation is FUD** **AND NEEDS TO BE DESTROYED**, as explained in another post I made here:  [Blackrock & 4D Chess](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msez57/blackrock_4d_chess/)\n\n*Q: Why is it FUD?* **A: Because people start rallying behind the idea that monday we're going to see big banks like RBC start to crumble and trigger the MOASS etc etc.** Inevitably this does not happen and people are let down.
