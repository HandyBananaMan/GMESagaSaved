They're looking to profit when the MOASS fucking destroys the top side of the market.

What happens if you are short shares that never existed, then they get combined into 1 share?\n\nThe fuck?\n\nHistorical values of some of these ETF's prior to 3 separate reverse Stock splits:\n\n[Previous Value of these ETF's prior to Reverse Stock Splits](https://preview.redd.it/99negsd2eyt61.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=8de6df7ae5d56fb1bf96f3c879d3e7e1db3209aa)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 5:\n\nMy Brain... ITS OVERFLOWING:\n\nWhat if theory:\n\nInverse ETF's are designed to go DOWN. A Reverse Stock split is a KNOWN quantity to occur.\n\nHypothetical: If you Naked Short an Inverse ETF (synthetic shares), then you have a Reverse Stock Split happen (10 get combined into 1) in theory you got paid crazy money on a stock that no longer exists due to the nature of these reverse splits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLOOK WHAT THIS IS MADE OUT OF:\n\n\\#1 - THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT (Bank OF New York Cash Reserve is a federal reserve bank)\n\n[Fidelity & Goldman Sachs & BANK OF NEW YORK CASH RESERVE](https://preview.redd.it/uugwbw6vhyt61.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd9c45be5ca45d41b8af4a3b24283d81c292ac5f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 6: More goodies for my fellow Apes!

Lots of digging to do.\n\n[https://www.thebalance.com/list-of-inverse-etfs-and-etns-1214928](https://www.thebalance.com/list-of-inverse-etfs-and-etns-1214928)\n\nWill update later when I got some time.

The act of reverse splitting is the same as a regular ETF's stock split, IE - more shares = same money.\n\nNow its simply, Less shares = same money.\n\nDue to how we all know that the ticker is NOT representative of the real price in a manipulated security it is incredibly easy to see how SPXS may be like a bundle of taut cords, about to snap but not readily apparent until it simply happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 11:\n\nTA;DR -\n\nSPXS goes down, SPY goes up.\n\nSPXS goes up, SPY goes down.\n\nGME correlates with SPXS movements.\n\nIf GME goes up, SPXS will go up, and SPY will go down.\n\nCitadel & friends are HYPER Long on SPXS (and other Inverse ETF's) = Profit from GME Mooning. HODL will make all their profits get eaten tho by hungry apes.",
