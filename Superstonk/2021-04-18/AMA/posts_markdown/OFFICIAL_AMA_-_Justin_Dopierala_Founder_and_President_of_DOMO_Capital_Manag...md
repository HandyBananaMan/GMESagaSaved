**A message from Justin Dopierala:**

Hey everyone – really looking forward to the AMA on 4/20 at 4:20 PM Central Time. DOMO Capital is a state-registered investment advisor that manages money for clients identically through separately managed accounts.  Our YouTube channel has a [great video that gives a brief 5 minute introduction on our company](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3rCaBlsLlWJagcpbsais4w) that might answer some of the questions you would have. You can read more about our [philosophy, discipline, and process on our website](https://www.domocapital.com/philosophy.html) where you can also view our [Fact Sheet](https://www.domocapital.com/factsheet.html).

A lot of you are probably aware of DOMO Capital from our Twitter posts, but we’re also one of the few “OGs” when it comes to GameStop.  In fact, we are currently shooting footage, at this very moment, for what will be the one and only legitimate GameStop documentary which is being produced by Jonah Tulis and Submarine Entertainment for one of the top distributors in the world ([you can read more about it here](https://deadline.com/2021/02/jonah-tulis-gamestop-documentary-submarine-1234687991/)). I am the Midwestern father of two that is mentioned in the write-up.

I started investing clients of DOMO Capital into GameStop back in 2018. As time went on, I started to get frustrated with bearish article after bearish article framing GameStop in a way that was completely inaccurate. Therefore, I decided that action needed to be taken, and I started writing about GameStop in May of 2019. I ended up writing [6 articles on GameStop through October of 2020](https://seekingalpha.com/author/justin-dopierala#regular_articles&ticker=gme). It is true that we sold our last shares in January of 2021 in the $40’s, but we were also buying shares of GME for our clients in the mid $2’s. I’ve had the pleasure of having many conversations with many of the main people involved: Ryan Cohen, Senvest, Kurt Wolf, George Sherman, Jim Bell, etc.

[Here is a link to my bio](https://www.domocapital.com/team.html) \- I am by no means an expert on the intricacies of what goes on behind the scenes in the market from a trading standpoint. I will answer your questions in this regard as best I can, but don’t expect any great insights from me on fail to delivers or anything like that. It is likely beyond my comprehension!

I am looking forward to the AMA and am truly happy to answer any questions you have. In no way should any of my comments be construed as financial advice as this AMA is for educational purposes only.

DOMO Capital is known for going against the grain and doing things a little differently and this AMA will be no different.  Instead of responding to your comments with comments – we are going to host a live stream from our YouTube channel and answer the questions on video. Chat on the stream will be turned off so that we can focus solely on the questions that are being asked of us on Reddit.
