    "selftext": "This is the **Official AMA (Ask Me Anything) for Justin Dopierala**, the Founder and President of DOMO Capital Management LLC. Please leave comments and questions below, and the sooner the better so Justin can prepare some great answers. **This post will remain active until April 20 @ 4:20 p.m. CT**, at which point it will be locked and Justin will appear on Youtube livestream via the link below to answer questions live.\n\nHe also would like you all to know that he accepts the hardball questions, but remember to be honest and ask earnest questions, as to be respectful of Justin's time.  Thank you Justin!!!\n\n**A message from Justin Dopierala:**\n\nHey everyone \u2013 really looking forward to the AMA on 4/20 at 4:20 PM Central Time. DOMO Capital is a state-registered investment advisor that manages money for clients identically through separately managed accounts.\u00a0 Our YouTube channel has a [great video that gives a brief 5 minute introduction on our company](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3rCaBlsLlWJagcpbsais4w) that might answer some of the questions you would have. You can read more about our [philosophy, discipline, and process on our website](https://www.domocapital.com/philosophy.html) where you can also view our [Fact Sheet](https://www.domocapital.com/factsheet.html).\n\nA lot of you are probably aware of DOMO Capital from our Twitter posts, but we\u2019re also one of the few \u201cOGs\u201d when it comes to GameStop.\u00a0 In fact, we are currently shooting footage, at this very moment, for what will be the one and only legitimate GameStop documentary which is being produced by Jonah Tulis and Submarine Entertainment for one of the top distributors in the world ([you can read more about it here](https://deadline.com/2021/02/jonah-tulis-gamestop-documentary-submarine-1234687991/)). I am the Midwestern father of two that is mentioned in the write-up.\n\nI started investing clients of DOMO Capital into GameStop back in 2018.\u00a0As time went on, I started to get frustrated with bearish article after bearish article framing GameStop in a way that was completely inaccurate. Therefore, I decided that action needed to be taken, and I started writing about GameStop in May of 2019. I ended up writing [6 articles on GameStop through October of 2020](https://seekingalpha.com/author/justin-dopierala#regular_articles&ticker=gme). It is true that we sold our last shares in January of 2021 in the $40\u2019s, but we were also buying shares of GME for our clients in the mid $2\u2019s. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of having many conversations with many of the main people involved: Ryan Cohen, Senvest, Kurt Wolf, George Sherman, Jim Bell, etc.\n\n[Here is a link to my bio](https://www.domocapital.com/team.html) \\- I am by no means an expert on the intricacies of what goes on behind the scenes in the market from a trading standpoint.\u00a0I will answer your questions in this regard as best I can, but don\u2019t expect any great insights from me on fail to delivers or anything like that.\u00a0It is likely beyond my comprehension!\n\nI am looking forward to the AMA and am truly happy to answer any questions you have. In no way should any of my comments be construed as financial advice as this AMA is for educational purposes only.\n\nDOMO Capital is known for going against the grain and doing things a little differently and this AMA will be no different.\u00a0 Instead of responding to your comments with comments \u2013 we are going to host a live stream from our YouTube channel and answer the questions on video.\u00a0Chat on the stream will be turned off so that we can focus solely on the questions that are being asked of us on Reddit.\n\n# [JOIN THE LIVESTREAM HERE](https://youtu.be/lSSajuW0kQI) - starts April 20 @ 4:20 p.m. CT\n\n\\---\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nDOMO Capital Management, LLC (\"DOMO\") is a state-registered investment adviser in Wisconsin and Michigan.
