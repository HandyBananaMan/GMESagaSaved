<p>Edit: I‚Äôm so dumb, there is no connection to the cryptos here. My dumb ass was looking at Saturday and the timings happened to line up. Banks happened on Friday, crypto happened Saturday. I‚Äôm a idiot, please forgive</p>
<p>I want to preface this post that I don't know what this all actually means other than something fucky happened at 4PM EST and 5:07PM EST on Friday. Everyone talked about Royal Bank of Canada showing volume at $33.75 and I wanted to check it out myself. I clicked into the "see more trades" button and that was just the beginning.     </p>
<p>Right as I finished my DD and started to make this post, I see posts of Bitcoin losing money and for the dip today, the timing lines up. My initial fear after completing my DD was that there were other sectors/regions having the same thing happening and my heart sank when I saw the news on Bitcoin. I think we're connecting two dots today ü¶çs, (apparently 3, I found another one at the end üò≠)</p>
<p>This DD is broken into 3 Sections because I wanted to understand different aspects. What happened with Royal Bank of Canada? Did anything like this happen to other banks? What about top shareholders of Royal Bank of Canada?. This is going to be long, but it's worth it. The tiers are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>~Bitcoin connection (I did this in 2 minutes after finishing initial DD and seeing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt5eas/uh_bitcoin_just_lost_10k_in_value_in_like_a_minute/">other post about bitcoin</a>~ see edit above</li>
<li>Royal Bank of Canada, look into last 100 AH trades</li>
<li>What about a bunch of other banks?, look into last 100 AH trades</li>
<li>Top shareholders of Royal Bank of Canada, look into last 100 AH trades or fund connections</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to analyze the last 100 AH trades because that was the default returned by Nasdaq. I'm planning on writing some code to go through all the trades, but this will take many days and I fear I don't have time to complete that before this post. If there aren't 100 trades available, I will use the max there is. I also did some general googling as I went through everything to fill in gaps or questions I had. Buckle in everyone!</p>
<p>~<strong>Bitcoin connection</strong>~
~All I want you to know in this connection is when things happened, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8Fkh48A">look at 4PM EST</a>. It's when everything happened today and I think it means next week is fucked.~ see edit at top</p>

<p>All I did was copy/pasta from nasdaq website into a google sheet and do 5 dumb formulas. This was done the same for each institution in this DD (where possible)</p>
<p>Sooooooo it looks like the after hours volume was approximately 19.65% of volume for the day? I could just imagine a room like from margin call, where they make the decision to be the first person to run out of the room and exit positions. Although we don't know if these are buys or sells, it's volume (probably sells). Mainly, it looks fucked and that's on top of the weird price "glitch" that some shills are saying to ignore (and sells might explain why the price dipped to that for some poor souls).</p>
<p><strong>What about a bunch of other banks?, look into last 100 AH trades</strong>
 I just randomly thought of banks and made a quick list, others can add to this post if they want, I'm not sure if it matters much. </p>
<p>I'll summarize the banks after hours volume as a % of total volume for the day to get a starting point since the Royal Bank of Canada analysis pointed at a high volume in AH</p>

<p>There were some banks that had some consistency to it and nothing looked really strange, but I also wasn't able to see the 1600 timeline for the banks because they have so much AH trading. There might be some stuff in there, but honestly I found a lot more interesting data further in the analysis. I will try and access that data in the future with a script, but the nasdaq website isn't letting me expand on that time region in their shitty app. Banks with too much volume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citigroup</li>
<li>Credit Suisse</li>
<li>Bank of America - above 5% in AH volume</li>
<li>Wells Fargo</li>
<li>JP Morgan Chase (JPM)</li>
<li>Morgan Stanley</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Deutsche Bank and Fidelity have low after hours volume and you can see trades executed around the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deutsche Bank - Only see 16,345 shares @ $12.55 and this could also just be nothing. That's chump change. I'm leaving this data point out of analysis as an outlier because I can't definitively say this looks weird.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fidelity - There are a decent amount of trades at this time and the volumes are all over the place, so I'm not sure what to add. I'm leaving this data point out of analysis as an outlier because I can't definitively say this looks weird.</li>

<p>So the initial bank analysis is kind of a bust. The nasdaq website sucks and I'll have to try and build a script to get at those specific pieces. I wanted to keep this because I think it's important to still report all the criteria I initially started with. Onto the next piece.</p>

<p>YIKES!!! So....Someone (or some algo) did something big with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_(banks)">Big 5 Banks of Canada</a> and ~Bitcoin. I'm going to assume the volume above is selling based on the Bitcoin aspect. Well at least that giant second player at around 17:07 didn't hold Bitcoin. The <a href="https://imgur.com/a/36tmMD2">second player had Ethereum</a> and it looks like the first player did also~ see edit at top. There is definitely a couple $100M between all that and I think that is a conservative estimate now. I'm guessing we're going to get shills saying that 1600 is some common time for things to auto-do-things, I don't buy it.</p>
<p>I'm afraid for the world next week, but I'll be sitting on my hands and jerking it my GME. Is that enough disclaimer I'm up to the tits in GME? This might not have anything to do with GME, but something is about to happen. My first big markdown post with graphs and pictures as links, hopefully it formats right on first post.</p>

<p>Edit: Thank you to whoever gave my new account it's first award, I appreciate you. üöÄüåïü¶ç</p>
<p>Edit 2: After seeing a lot more posts of things just connecting, we should not celebrate, but keep in mind that there is a chance that Friday was a significant date in the shorts eyes and we are seeing a step in the execution of their next plan. Stay alert and always vigilant, hold for the tendies, you know I will be</p>
