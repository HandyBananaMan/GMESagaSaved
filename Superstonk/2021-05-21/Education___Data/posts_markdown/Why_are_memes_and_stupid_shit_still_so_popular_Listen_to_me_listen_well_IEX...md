Buy GameStop on IEX or on straight to market brokers every post should be this and every body should do this. Don’t ask me what the shit is you want to be a millionaire or billionaire look it up your self. Don’t be so incredibly lazy. If you refuse to fight the war rather than just buy your one share and say your doing something stfu.

Buy on IEX or on a direct to market broker. Buy on t+21 and 35 days. You either wanna win or you want to complain about manipulation. Buy gme on iex or direct to market broker. That needs to be every single post till this is over. Like this if you want but you should repost and flood the timeline with iex or direct to market. Only way to stop the super manipulation.
