<p>I just remembered reading an article about how the market crash back in 2008 happened on a Monday.  It was Monday September 29, 2008.  </p>
<p>The market opened and the Dow Jones Industrial dropped 777.68 points.  </p>
<p>That was because all the things to set up that drop, happened on the WEEKEND.  We’ve been seeing some indications that the 24th and 25th of this month line up with T+21 and T+35.  I’m expecting some crazy things to happen this weekend right?  I’m thinking articles coming out.  I’m thinking movement from big players.  I’m thinking crypto doesn’t ever close like the market does....oh shit.</p>
<p>Check the crypto market...</p>
<p>I’m thinking this is about to get real.  Keep your emotions in check apes!  Keep on the lookout for more info this weekend!</p>
