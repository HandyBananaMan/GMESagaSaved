    "selftext": "I just remembered reading an article about how the market crash back in 2008 happened on a Monday.  It was Monday September 29, 2008.  \n\nThe market opened and the Dow Jones Industrial dropped 777.68 points.  \n\nThat was because all the things to set up that drop, happened on the WEEKEND.  We\u2019ve been seeing some indications that the 24th and 25th of this month line up with T+21 and T+35.  I\u2019m expecting some crazy things to happen this weekend right?  I\u2019m thinking articles coming out.  I\u2019m thinking movement from big players.  I\u2019m thinking crypto doesn\u2019t ever close like the market does....oh shit.\n\nCheck the crypto market...\n\nI\u2019m thinking this is about to get real.  Keep your emotions in check apes!  Keep on the lookout for more info this weekend!",
