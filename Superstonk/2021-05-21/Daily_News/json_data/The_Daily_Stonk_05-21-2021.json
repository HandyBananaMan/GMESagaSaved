There were some apes who were kind enough to hop on the train and even go there.\n\nWhat we found out:\n\nIt was most likely a suspicious package that showed up, as some users already noticed that the fire trucks there were the ones with Hazmat suits in them (I didn't even know that there was a special version truck for this tbh), but as  [/u/xsonusx](https://www.reddit.com/u/xsonusx/) mentioned in the comments;\n\n \"Suspicious package called in earlier.

Lucy Komisar Part 2 - Monday, May 24, 2021 @ 4:30 p.m. Eastern \n\n \n\nThis is the official AMA (Ask Me Anything) post for **Lucy Komisar (Pt. 2)**, who will be joining [u/Luridess](https://www.reddit.com/u/Luridess/) once again on [Superstonk Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuPizlDY0Ys) for a one-on-one discussion, with questions influenced by and taken directly from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhglmp/official_ama_lucy_komisar_part_2_monday_may_24/).\n\nBe sure to give the thread a read and leave your questions you have for her there, and if you've not seen part one you can view it [here](https://youtu.be/wKXWvEpnN34)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kodqxcnq2g071.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=97f50305dc7fbf92fc637778e7dc19a5b0332f27\n\n# DR BuRRRRRRY\n\nAt this point everyone here has most likely seen \"the big short\" a couple of times, or even better, read the book.\n\nWell it seems that other stock subs are noticing that there is something big going on, most of the ones ask questions like \"Is there even a stock with negative beta?\" or they started to look into Dr Burry's findings, because well... the dude is smarter than all of us put together.\n\n[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nga3as/margin_debt_archegos_capital_total_return_swaps/) goes over some of the findings and indicators Dr Burry uses to check the market, it's mostly about the margins debts and how Archegos was overleveraged and how that affects the rest, and how a market crash is very close.\n\nbe sure to give it a read\n\nAlso on the repo market (something you've undoubtedly seen mentioned a few times here now) here is a video of about 5 minutes explaining what Repo's are and what they mean and what they're for.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nh9g0u/you\\_may\\_develop\\_some\\_wrinkles\\_george\\_gammon\\_repo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nh9g0u/you_may_develop_some_wrinkles_george_gammon_repo/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Can you smell that?](https://preview.redd.it/0j9nrhrr2g071.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6b47d56194563e63f6c34762a344eda64ad15b1)\n\n# 004\n\n004 was the rule about members of the DTCC defaulting then the other members could buy up their stocks for pennies on the dollar before turning to open market, making sure they can profit off of other defaulting members.\n\nAlso a thread was made in update for the 005 here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngwhzu/where\\_is\\_srdtc2021005\\_the\\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngwhzu/where_is_srdtc2021005_the_update/)\n\nthe user had some personal interaction with the SEC/dtcc on where the hell it is.\n\nIt comes down to \"we're on it\" but again read the thread itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtu3vent2g071.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=51c287a3be33ca64294f019e0811a4d8ee4388c0\n\n# Robbin da hood\n\nOver the last few days we have seen a lot of different posts coming up about robinhood giving weird statements, showing that people who are transferring out of RH (and to Fidelity or another one) they get statements showing all their shares were fractional shares bought at times and prices that don't match up with what is going on right now.\n\nI remember a member having XXX shares but their cost basis was around 1.3 million, while they didn't spend anywhere near that, or people having single shares bought around the 600 mark and the ATH of the stock was below 500.\n\nNow there are multiple ways to explain this.\n\n1) something deep dark and sinister is happening, users have speculated that RH is buying them off of Citadel at inflated prices, meaning they're using this to stave off a margin call\n\n2) Robinhood's system is just bad and fucked up.\n\n3) Robinhood is buying them from darkpools, and seeing the stock is getting harder and harder to come by they are asking for higher prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me personally I think it's number two, Robinhood has shown to be incompetent on multiple accounts and times, whenever crypto goes up their system goes bust and have an \"unexpected planned maintenance\", transferring out does not go as smooth as it should for some members, this all leads me to believe that RH's tech stuff has been a shitty system at best, and no one expected a mass exodus from their platform and their system is not equipped to handle this, ending in lots of errors.\n\nNo matter the case be sure to keep your receipts in case the IRS ever comes knocking so you can show your actual cost basis and amount of shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngx2ag/hypothesis\\_robinhood\\_is\\_currently\\_buying\\_the\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngx2ag/hypothesis_robinhood_is_currently_buying_the_gme/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngkrg3/proof\\_that\\_rh\\_had\\_to\\_scramble\\_to\\_find\\_shares\\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngkrg3/proof_that_rh_had_to_scramble_to_find_shares_when/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngun6e/proof\\_that\\_rh\\_scrambled\\_to\\_find\\_shares\\_during\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngun6e/proof_that_rh_scrambled_to_find_shares_during_my/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngw2xo/i\\_just\\_fully\\_transferred\\_out\\_of\\_robinhood\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngw2xo/i_just_fully_transferred_out_of_robinhood_to/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2rsf0bv2g071.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79d83a4e5459aecc4e4104c2d3d5a1ecd6ce33e\n\n# Weird transactions for the past few days\n\n3 days in a row weird transactions have been happening, this was found out by the german sub r/Spielstopp but still need to look into this on it's validity and not sure what this could possibly be or mean perhaps some smarter apes here could take a look and find out what it could possibly mean.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Spielstopp/comments/ngfhuw/dritter\\_tag\\_in\\_folge\\_324106\\_aktien\\_blocktrade\\_auf/gytoixh/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spielstopp/comments/ngfhuw/dritter_tag_in_folge_324106_aktien_blocktrade_auf/gytoixh/?context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z56lpl8w2g071.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=457e8f3a80eb0e3a7d31c732e579a1266ec7e2fc\n\n# The best for last\n\n**GO VOTE**, again check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhc8x4/dont_be_lazy_and_think_enough_people_will_vote/) thread.\n\nREAD IT, AND GO VOTE.\n\nif your broker does not let you vote, nag them, keep asking them until you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ix29mpx2g071.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f932bb7568a04d509df8ee6e9a3b40f28705901\n\n# EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\nRemember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n

go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it
