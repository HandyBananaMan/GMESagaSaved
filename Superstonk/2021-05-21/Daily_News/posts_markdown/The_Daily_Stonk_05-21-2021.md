# Did someone deliver mayo?

Written by u/rensole

So it seems that yesterday was a busy day at the Citadel HQ, there was a thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhctbx/citadel_is_having_some_trouble_right_now/) showing a large police and fire trucks on the scene. There were some apes who were kind enough to hop on the train and even go there.

What we found out:

It was most likely a suspicious package that showed up, as some users already noticed that the fire trucks there were the ones with Hazmat suits in them (I didn't even know that there was a special version truck for this tbh), but as  [/u/xsonusx](https://www.reddit.com/u/xsonusx/) mentioned in the comments;

 "Suspicious package called in earlier. Nothing going on at the building at the moment"

# DR BuRRRRRRY

At this point everyone here has most likely seen "the big short" a couple of times, or even better, read the book.

Well it seems that other stock subs are noticing that there is something big going on, most of the ones ask questions like "Is there even a stock with negative beta?" or they started to look into Dr Burry's findings, because well... the dude is smarter than all of us put together.

[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nga3as/margin_debt_archegos_capital_total_return_swaps/) goes over some of the findings and indicators Dr Burry uses to check the market, it's mostly about the margins debts and how Archegos was overleveraged and how that affects the rest, and how a market crash is very close.

be sure to give it a read

Also on the repo market (something you've undoubtedly seen mentioned a few times here now) here is a video of about 5 minutes explaining what Repo's are and what they mean and what they're for.

# 004

004 was the rule about members of the DTCC defaulting then the other members could buy up their stocks for pennies on the dollar before turning to open market, making sure they can profit off of other defaulting members.

Also a thread was made in update for the 005 here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngwhzu/where\_is\_srdtc2021005\_the\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ngwhzu/where_is_srdtc2021005_the_update/)

the user had some personal interaction with the SEC/dtcc on where the hell it is.

It comes down to "we're on it" but again read the thread itself.

# Robbin da hood

Over the last few days we have seen a lot of different posts coming up about robinhood giving weird statements, showing that people who are transferring out of RH (and to Fidelity or another one) they get statements showing all their shares were fractional shares bought at times and prices that don't match up with what is going on right now.

I remember a member having XXX shares but their cost basis was around 1.3 million, while they didn't spend anywhere near that, or people having single shares bought around the 600 mark and the ATH of the stock was below 500.

Now there are multiple ways to explain this.

1) something deep dark and sinister is happening, users have speculated that RH is buying them off of Citadel at inflated prices, meaning they're using this to stave off a margin call

2) Robinhood's system is just bad and fucked up.

3) Robinhood is buying them from darkpools, and seeing the stock is getting harder and harder to come by they are asking for higher prices.

&#x200B;

For me personally I think it's number two, Robinhood has shown to be incompetent on multiple accounts and times, whenever crypto goes up their system goes bust and have an "unexpected planned maintenance", transferring out does not go as smooth as it should for some members, this all leads me to believe that RH's tech stuff has been a shitty system at best, and no one expected a mass exodus from their platform and their system is not equipped to handle this, ending in lots of errors.

No matter the case be sure to keep your receipts in case the IRS ever comes knocking so you can show your actual cost basis and amount of shares.

# Weird transactions for the past few days

3 days in a row weird transactions have been happening, this was found out by the german sub r/Spielstopp but still need to look into this on it's validity and not sure what this could possibly be or mean perhaps some smarter apes here could take a look and find out what it could possibly mean.

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

&#x200B;

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
