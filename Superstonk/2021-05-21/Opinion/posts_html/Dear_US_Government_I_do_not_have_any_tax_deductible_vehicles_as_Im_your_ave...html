<p>These hedge funds have been getting away with tax breaks while the regular guy has been paying hand over fist for their taxes. MOASS at this stage is more than getting rich quick. It's about income redistribution, taxes actually getting paid, and cleaning up the filth on Wallstreet.</p>
<p>So fellow American apes, prepare to get loaded, but also prepare to get bent over by Uncle Sam. As always, we'll carry the tax burden. This should be a major incentive for the US Gov't to allow MOASS.</p>
