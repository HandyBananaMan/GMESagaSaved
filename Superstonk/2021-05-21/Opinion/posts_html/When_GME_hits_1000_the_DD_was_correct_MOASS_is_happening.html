<p>When GME hits $5,000 you have the satisfaction of knowing that this is going to go to the millions. </p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>Because you, and the rest of the apes you’ve spent the last 5 months talking to, know that this is bigger than all of you combined. </p>
<p>Yes, it’s life changing money... but this is also a FUCK YOU to Wall Street. </p>
<p>They’ve fucked us for far too long and played games with our money, expecting us to bail them out yet AGAIN for gambling away people’s pensions, 401k’s and now the US fucking dollar. </p>
<p>They are too greedy for their own good. </p>
<p>So what do we do? Hold for life changing money? no. </p>
<p>We hold until they lose everything. 
Until they lose so fucking hard that it’s a message heard all around the world. We’re going to hold until every ape has the net worth of every billionaire and millionaire in the world, and then we’re going to use that money to make the world a better place by making sure you never get to do this shit again. We’ll take it all. </p>
<p>Do not fuck with my family ever again.</p>
