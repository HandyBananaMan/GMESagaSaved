In the words of Admiral Akbar.... IT'S A TRAP. The whole reason GME is in it's current position was bad actors trying to artificially bankrupt and drive a company into the ground. Do not become that which you detest, be better.

Robinhood will fail on it's own, there is no need to short it. It's an absolute dogshit company that will bankrupt itself without external forces. Anyone who shorts it when it IPOs is a complete idiot, and risks losing their entire portfolio.

I'd go as far as suspecting that anyone trying to encourage shorting it could be a shill. Stay safe, apes - use some of those new wrinkles.
