Hold for life changing money? no. \n\nWe hold until they lose everything. \nUntil they lose so fucking hard that it\u2019s a message heard all around the world. We\u2019re going to hold until every ape has the net worth of every billionaire and millionaire in the world, and then we\u2019re going to use that money to make the world a better place by making sure you never get to do this shit again. We\u2019ll take it all. \n\nDo not fuck with my family ever again.",
