    "selftext": "These hedge funds have been getting away with tax breaks while the regular guy has been paying hand over fist for their taxes. MOASS at this stage is more than getting rich quick. It's about income redistribution, taxes actually getting paid, and cleaning up the filth on Wallstreet.\n\nSo fellow American apes, prepare to get loaded, but also prepare to get bent over by Uncle Sam. As always, we'll carry the tax burden. This should be a major incentive for the US Gov't to allow MOASS.\n\n\nEdit: just learned about NIIT (3.8%)\nhttps://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc559\n\nEdit2: Fellow redditor shares this link\nhttps://taxmytendies.com\nTy u/greywolf_creations\n\n\nLet me know what else I\u2019m missing. I don\u2019t wanna end up liquidating like Shitadel to pay uncle sam.\n\nTLDR: Buy, Hold, Vote, save for taxes (up to ~57% for CA residences)",
    "title": "Dear US Government, I do not have any tax deductible vehicles as I'm your average W2 wage earner with no self-employed income/deductions. Unlike these asshole hedgies, I'll actually pay the stupid fucking 37% tax rate if you allow the MOASS to happen. And the extra stupid fucking 13.3% CA tax",
