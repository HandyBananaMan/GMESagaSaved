<p>No tendies for you.</p>
<p><strong>TL'DR</strong> : Trust the DD. But also remember that you are a retarded Earth ape that is largely moved by emotions rather then logic. You will feel ALL SORTS of feelings when the rocket is taking off. Do not be fooled by dips. Do not be fooled by your own mind. Do not be fooled by the absolute avalanche of FUD that will hit us right as the MOASS begins. Always remember no matter what, when it gets as high as any of these numbers... we win.</p>
