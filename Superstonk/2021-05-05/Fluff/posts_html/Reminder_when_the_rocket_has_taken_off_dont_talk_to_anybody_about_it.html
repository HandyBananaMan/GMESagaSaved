<p>This rocket is primed for an explosion, we all know it, because we have done the work, and read the DD done by the wrinkly brains on here. </p>
<p>But other people around you haven't read the same DD and done the research, so they're obviously going to recommend selling when it reaches new highs, so for your own sake, don't talk to anyone about it. </p>
<p>Me personally, will be distancing myself from the people around me while I wait patiently for the peak to be reached. The people I have been talking to about this on the daily, I've already informed them not to try and influence my decision on when I'm selling. </p>
