<p>I saw a post about how the wealth of 1/10 of the world's richest people could end world hunger and wondered "why don't they end world hunger?" </p>
<p>I understand it's more complicated than money, but money sure would help a lot. And we're about to have a lot of it. </p>
<p>Maybe this is a crazy idea, but Superstonk could be a place for all us millionaires to discuss how to save the world with our tendies. Not as a collective, but like the individual apes we are. </p>
<p>Perform due diligence on which charities and technologies could best use the money. </p>
<p>Tackle the world's problems as only apes can.</p>
