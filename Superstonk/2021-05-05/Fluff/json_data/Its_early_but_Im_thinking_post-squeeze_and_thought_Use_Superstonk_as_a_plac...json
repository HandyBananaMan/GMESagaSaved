    "selftext": "I saw a post about how the wealth of 1/10 of the world's richest people could end world hunger and wondered \"why don't they end world hunger?\" \n\nI understand it's more complicated than money, but money sure would help a lot. And we're about to have a lot of it. \n\nMaybe this is a crazy idea, but Superstonk could be a place for all us millionaires to discuss how to save the world with our tendies. Not as a collective, but like the individual apes we are. \n\nPerform due diligence on which charities and technologies could best use the money. \n\nTackle the world's problems as only apes can.",
