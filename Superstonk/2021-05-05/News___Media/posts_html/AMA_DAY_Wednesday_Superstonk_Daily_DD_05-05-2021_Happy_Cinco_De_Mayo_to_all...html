<p>All we are waiting for now is NSCC-002, which should go into effect no later than 5/8 (5/7 because of the weekend).</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means theoretically 002 could go into effect as soon as today, but I wouldn't plan on it.</p>
<p>But soon moon 🚀🚀🌝</p>

<h1>📢More on today's Big Wrinkly Brain AMA with Dave Lauer and u/Jsmar18, intro by u/Bye_Triangle</h1>
<p><strong>Here we go Apes... It's time for some big-brained learning</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Big brain time 🧠" src="https://preview.redd.it/fbib424lf8x61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2c89c91134dd77319a1d58d3cdaf57c1486a15" /></p>
<p>If you don't already know, we have a very exciting guest with us today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itxbyXO67XY">David Lauer</a> is joining us for our second edition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4EET9NJPWxUuXGlG6fxPA">r/SuperStonk Live</a>. If you aren't familiar with David Lauer here is a quick rundown:</p>
<p>David Lauer used to build the very High-Frequency Trading systems used everywhere in the markets today. If anyone knows the ins and outs of these low latency trading systems, it's this guy. Following his time building these systems he went on to be the one to operate them.</p>
<p>Lauer took on the role of High-Frequency Trader at none other than Citadel. (Obviously, he will not be on to talk about any sensitive information, please keep that in mind). Following his tenure with Citadel, he went on to another company, Allston Trading where he also worked as a High-Frequency Trader. So there is no question that his experience in this field will provide us with some very valuable insight. After a bit more than a year of High-Frequency Trading, Lauer had the life-changing realization that HFT systems do more harm than good to our capital markets.</p>
<p>Since then, he has worked tirelessly to help improve the situation, even testifying before the US Senate. So, if there was any doubt, this guy is on the same side as us. That is to say, we share a common goal, improvement in the quality of our markets. David Lauer currently has a seat on the FINRA Market Regulation Committee and on the founding editorial board of the Journal of AI and Ethics.</p>
<p><strong>So, now that you are caught up... ARE YOU AS HYPED AS I AM?! We are going to earn so many real wrinkles today, my fellow apes, The only thing the hedgies hate more than us buying and holding, is us Buying, Holding, and Learning. No more can they call us "Dumb Money".</strong></p>
<h1>So, without further delay, <a href="https://youtu.be/AYct0XX0uTU">Here is the link to the AMA</a>!!!</h1>
<h1>It starts at 3:00 pm eastern time, just like the last one. So set your alarms folks. Also, Pink had the genius idea to include a timezone converter last time so here is <a href="https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/">that</a> because timezones are confusing 😵😵</h1>
<h1>Back to you, u/PinkCatsOnAcid! 🦄🐱‍🚀</h1>

<h1>Heckin low volume yesterday</h1>
<p>If liquidity isn't an issue, then why was volume as low as the 100s yesterday? (Yes, 3 digits) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4t1mb/we_just_had_two_1_min_candles_with_0_volume_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Some level 2 data even showing 1 min candles with literally 0 volume.</a> I saw it said that it's like waiting for the last few kernels of popcorn to pop before enjoying your snack. 🍿 Everyone knows people around the world are buying and not selling because Gamestop is an awesome company with a bright future. Man I love this stock!!! 💎💅🚀🐱‍🚀</p>

<h1>🚨 BANK OF AMERICA HEDGE FUND SELLING AT EXTREME LEVELS 🚨 This is not a drill!! Main Stream Media is reporting!</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Why collect so much cash, BofA? Is for me? 👉👈" src="https://preview.redd.it/5yu2qh6of8x61.png?width=3807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=415d660a29c1bf4dc2edd2dfd56d3b5e90e596f2" /></p>
<p>Don't get too excited about all the sudden influx of cash though. It's probably headed to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4sbhz/omg_wtf_did_shitadel_register_something_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">the Cayman Islands</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n487aq/in_relation_to_bill_gates_getting_divorced/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">tied up in a divorce.</a> 🤷‍♀️ (&lt;&lt;&lt;Total speculation)</p>
<p>Basically Bank of America Hedge Fund liquidated everything in their holdings that wasn't Real Estate or Health Care.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/stock-winners-fall-in-latest-selloff-sparked-by-inflation-fears"><strong>Here is a free Bloomberg article that (kinda) explains</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>What does this have to do with GME? Ooooh IDK...</p>
<h1>Maybe because BofA Securities is one of the clearing brokers for Citadel</h1>

<h1>Who wants to beat the NASDAQ High Score?</h1>
<h1>⬆️⬆️⬇️⬇️⬅️➡️⬅️➡️🅱️🅰️▶️</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Apparently the highest number the NASDAQ can currently handle is $429,496.7295</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>🕹🎮NASDAQ HIGH SCORE 🕹🎮</h1>
<p>|Score|Ticker|Date|
|:-|:-|:-|
|<strong>$429,496.7295</strong>|TBD|?|
|<strong>$421,000</strong>|BRK.A|05-04-2021|</p>
<p>420k 😛</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="New high score, anyone?" src="https://preview.redd.it/k6zbwil0g8x61.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e31e3b26cbaf1a4b176715ee5f7970d2fc329273" /></p>
<p>It appears the NASDAQ is upgrading (to accommodate more zeroes presumably <strong>[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅]</strong> ) and should be done by the end of the month.</p>
