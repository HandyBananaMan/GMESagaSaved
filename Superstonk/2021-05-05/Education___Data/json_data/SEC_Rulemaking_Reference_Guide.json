The clearing agency shall not implement the proposed change if the Commission has any objection to the proposed change. The Commission may extend the period for review by an additional 60 days if the proposed change raises novel or complex issues, subject to the Commission providing the clearing agency with prompt written notice of the extension. A proposed change may be implemented in less than 60 days from the date the advance notice is filed, or the date further information requested by the Commission is received, if the Commission notifies the clearing agency in writing that it does not object to the proposed change and authorizes the clearing agency to implement the proposed change on an earlier date, subject to any conditions imposed by the Commission. The clearing agency shall post notice on its website of proposed changes that are implemented.\n\n# 08: Gary Gensler\n\n[Gary Gensler was sworn in on Apr. 14, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-65), since then 7 items have been filed.\n\n# 09: Endnote\n\nI would like to keep this up to date and as accurate as possible so that it can act as a central location to track the progress of this legislation.
