<h1>Title: Houston Wade says, "the hedge funds want the squeeze stretched out over a long period of time and are going to fight tooth and nail to try and crawl out of this. To insure they all go bankrupt, we want the squeeze to be short, violent, and with absolutely massive volume"</h1>

<p>Wade explains that the only chance the hedge funds make it out of this is if they stretch out the squeeze over months and years to make people lose interest and sell. </p>
<p>He also explains that in the event the hedge funds go bankrupt and the DTCC has to step in and clear the books that there is a chance that they might try to settle the remaining shorted shares. </p>
<p>Why settling the shares is NOT in the best interest of the government is because the the whole world is watching now to see how they will regulate the situation.</p>
<p>Everyone from long whales, international investors, retail investors are betting on the money to print and if the government decides to step in, settle the shares and stop the squeeze it is going to piss off international investors and make them pull out of the US Stock Market. </p>
<p>So according to Wade's DD. It is in the governments best interest to let the money print because this has drawn the attention of the whole world now. </p>
<p>That's the type of confirmation bias I need. Plus I just like the stock. This is not financial advice. </p>
