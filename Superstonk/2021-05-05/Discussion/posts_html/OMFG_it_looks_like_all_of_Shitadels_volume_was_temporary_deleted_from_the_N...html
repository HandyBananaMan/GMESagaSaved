<p>It had to come from the NYSE since that's where all these systems get their data for GME and it just so happens that GME. AMC, Nokia, BB are all part of the NYSE and from what I've been reading they all lost volume. It's like all of the volume coming from Citadel was temporarily removed from the NYSE, they make up roughly 40% of all volume. Citadel doesn't have the power to remove volume from the NYSE. It feels more like someone was digging deep into Citadel data and it accidentally got removed. it's like someone was doing SQL data dumps on Citadel and deleted the data by accident. Now, why would someone with admin privileges at the NYSE (very few people of such an important database) want to look at Citadel at market close on a live database? Unless someone very important was asking for the data. Reposting this shit because I didn't put enough rocket emojis in the original to get you apes to notices.</p>
