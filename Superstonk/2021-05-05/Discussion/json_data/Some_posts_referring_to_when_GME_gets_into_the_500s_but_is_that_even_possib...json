    "selftext": "Today someone posted on IEX that at times there were no asks below $99999. On the level 2 data I see from Fidelity there's never more than about 1000 or so (suspicious) asks on the board before some real ape is selling a couple of shares for 50k.\n\nAs long as the hedgefuck MM's are able to suppress the price by creating a few 100k new counterfeit shares, this thing isn't going to happen, but as soon as they can't, this thing is gonna spring like a bear trap, right?\n\nEven if someone could generate some more fake shares to temporarily keep it down once someone fails a margin call, are they gonna want to throw themselves in front of that bus once someone is forced to buy a million shares to cover? This thing is gonna rocket up so fast it's gonna make your head spin. A MM that does that last counterfeit short position is asking to be paying 100s of thousands per share inside of a couple of minutes.\n\n...and a giant GUH will ring throughout the land.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5hrzb/99k_spread_on_iex/",
