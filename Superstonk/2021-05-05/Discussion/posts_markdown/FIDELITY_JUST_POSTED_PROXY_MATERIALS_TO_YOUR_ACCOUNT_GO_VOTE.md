Mornin' Apes...

As I tried to let everyone know yesterday, today the proxy materials got entered into the system for you to go vote directly through your Fidelity account.

Go log in and click the **STATEMENTS** tab in your Account Portfolio.

Look for the tab labeled **PROXY MATERIALS**...

Click **VOTE**!

Have a great day apes.

(If you don't know how to vote individually on the topics, just vote With The Board)
