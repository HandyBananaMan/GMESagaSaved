<p>JUNE 3, 2021 EDIT: This has been reposted since the AGM is coming up quickly. Some apes have pointed out that the AMA with Wes Christian confirmed this further, that some over-voting may be corrected prior to those votes reaching Computershare/GME. </p>

<p>I know there is a lot of hope riding on over voting during the shareholder meeting. I made a DD post that was well received on the potential impact of over voting.</p>
<p>I wanted to follow up with this post, because in Dr. T's AMA, she mentioned something that I did not know - <strong>Broadridge offers a service to allow a broker to "correct" its voting records before the votes are put to the inspector of elections/the issuer</strong>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: This means that certain brokers who pay Broadridge may adjust the votes that they report to the company for the shareholder meeting in order to hide over-voting. <strong>This means that the actual votes cast may already be corrected (reduced to eliminate over voting from a particular broker) before the votes get to the company.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Many, including me, believe that over voting at the shareholder meeting will provide the Board of GameStop with evidence of naked shorting and that the shorts have not covered. Armed with this knowledge, the Board has an obligation to act in the best interests of its shareholders and may consider and implement courses of action designed to maximize shareholder value in light of this information.</p>
<p><em>But what if those votes are "corrected" before they even get to the company?</em></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the transcript (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1vubv/stonky_news_special_report_dr_susanne_trimbath/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1vubv/stonky_news_special_report_dr_susanne_trimbath/</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. T</li>
<li>Yes, and even <em>issuers</em> have a hard time finding out exactly what is going on with <em>their own stock,</em> this is a <strong>long-term</strong> problem. But there a few things which bubble up and one of them is during the annual meeting when it comes to voting</li>
<li>Now after we raised this issue in 2005 there was Broadbridge, who processes a lot of this electronically, put in a service to the brokers, they can pay that if they report more shares to be voted, <strong>THAN</strong> they have held at DTC, then Broadbridge will tell them to ‘fix it’ <em>before</em> they tell the issuer</li>
<li>And that is probably how 15% of the overvotes down, right, so they went from 100% of the test cases (Leaglese edit: being over-voted) to only 85% of the test cases, because Broadbridge will tell DTC, of the 1,000,000 million shares, 100,000 are held by Goldman, Merryl etc. So Broadbridge goes to Goldman and says you have 100,000, who does the vote go to?</li>
<li>Goldman then says we have 200,000 or 150,000, Broadbridge will say sorry, you only have 100,000 so you need to fix this. Goldman then has a system where they have retail investors, within their accounts that they have more shares than actually existed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is actually a very big deal and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>It is likely that the company itself will not get the full picture of how many of its shares actually over voted.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean?</strong></p>
<p>Do not put the shareholder results on a pedestal. Do not expect too much with these results. <strong>It is unlikely that the shareholder votes being cast will - ON THEIR OWN - trigger any squeeze. It is likely that FUD will spread when there isn't an insane announcement of 10x the float voting at the meeting. Ignore it, because you shouldn't expect that anyways.</strong></p>
<p>The company will have to file an 8-k within 4 business days after the shareholder meeting, here is an example from 2019 (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638019000128/form8-k2019votingresults.htm">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638019000128/form8-k2019votingresults.htm</a>). Note that the inspector of records will likely correct these numbers before finalizing them for the company to be filed with the SEC. The company would know the real number of votes reported to the inspector of records. Those votes will likely be adjusted for 8-k filing purposes, because you cannot properly disclose more shares voted than those that the company actually issued.</p>
<p>It is possible that the company would put out a statement in addition to its 8-k disclosing how much or whether it needed to adjust shares due to over voting, but the company may not.</p>
<p><strong>Why vote?</strong></p>
<p>Here's my perspective on it from my earlier post: While over-voting does not directly and immediately trigger a share recall or force shorts to cover, <strong>it does provide the company with information on the total votes cast, which it could use as evidence of massive naked shorting of its shares and consequently the fraudulent creation of millions of shares</strong>. The company may publicize this information, which would refute the narrative that all shorts covered. This may put the SEC and the NYSE on notice that this has happened and needs to be investigated and resolved immediately.</p>
<p><strong>This may also cause the company to pursue other actions that it would not have reasonable grounds to pursue without this hard evidence of the creation of synthetic shares that should not exist and artificially drive down shareholder value.</strong> Those other actions by the company may result in a triggering event that would force the shorts to cover.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vote your shares, you diamond handed apes, to fulfill your role as a shareholder of the company.</em></strong></p>
<p>For more information on the inspector of records and the voting process, you can see my post here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mya2a8/dd_heres_what_happens_if_there_is_over_voting/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mya2a8/dd_heres_what_happens_if_there_is_over_voting/</a></p>
<p><em>Still not legal or financial advice.</em></p>
<p>EDIT POST: /u/Repulsive_Counter_79 suggested reaching out to brokers asking about this. If any apes ask their brokerage if the broker pays Broadridge to advise if the votes reported exceed the broker's share position at DTC, it would be interesting to hear the response.</p>
<p>EDIT POST 1: Apparently Fidelity responded that they did not have information on this, but GME investor relations would be the ones to ask. That said, GME investor relations would not know about a broker's interaction with Broadridge to correct voting, so this remains a bit of a black box. </p>
