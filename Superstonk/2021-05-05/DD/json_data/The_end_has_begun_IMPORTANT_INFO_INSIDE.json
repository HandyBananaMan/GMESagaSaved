Repo transactions often involve overcollateralization. The extent of overcollateralization is known as a \u201chaircut.\u201d Why do haircuts exist? And what determine the size of the haircut? We show that the existence of haircuts is due to sequential trade in which parties may default and intermediate lenders face liquidity needs. When there is a positive probability that the borrower will default, then the lender\u2019s liquidity needs and own default risk in a subsequent transaction to sell the collateral become paramount. The haircut size depends on (i) the default probabilities of the borrower, (ii) the liquidity needs of the lender, (iii) the default probability of the lender in a subsequent repo transaction and (iv) the nature of the collateral \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is a \"MBS\" or \"CMBS?\"\n\nSource: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmbs.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cmbs.asp)\n\n\" Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are fixed-income investment products that are backed by mortgages on commercial properties rather than residential real estate. CMBS can provide liquidity to real estate investors and commercial lenders alike. \"\n\nWhy are these important?\n\nRequired watch for all investors:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2xIgseFCpc&amp;start=41s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2xIgseFCpc&amp;start=41s)\n\nSo, what are the implications behind a 100% haircut. Well, this essentially makes all MBS /CMBS bonds that are \"Not Rated or Rated below Aa2/AA\" worthless as collateral. Why is this important? Because in the Repo Market ([https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/01/28/what-is-the-repo-market-and-why-does-it-matter/](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/01/28/what-is-the-repo-market-and-why-does-it-matter/)) collateral is king.\n\nThe repo market is the glue that holds our global economy together, and it's fueled by bonds. In laymans, Repo Markets are where big banks go for 24hr loans. These 24hr loans mean they don't need cash on hand, and can utilize it in the market. These markets are integral to ensuring our global economy runs smoothly. If the repo markets go under, we get 2008 all over again.\n\n\nEdit: \nLet me add this example from the knvesropedia article, familiar?\n\n\u201cLong-Term Capital Management's (LTCM) Failure and Collateral Haircuts Example\nLTCM was a hedge fund started in 1993. By 1998 it had amassed massive losses, nearly resulting in a collapse of the financial system. The basis of LTCM's profit model, which worked very well for a while, was to suck up small profits from market inefficiencies. This is commonly called arbitrage. The firm used historical models to highlight opportunities and then deployed capital to profit from them.\n\nEach opportunity typically only produced a small amount of profit, so the firm utilized leverage\u2014or borrowed money\u2014in order to increase the gains. The firm had $5 billion in assets, yet controlled over $1 trillion worth of positions.\n\nBanks and other institutions allowed LTCM to borrow or leverage so much, with little collateral, mainly because they viewed the firm and their positions as non-risky. Ultimately, though, the firm's model failed to predict inefficiencies accurately, and those massively sized positions began to lose far more money than the firm actually had...and more money than many of the banks and institutions that lent to them or allow them to purchase assets had.\n\nThe failure of LTCM, which required a bailout of the financial system, resulted in much higher haircut rules in terms of what can be posted as collateral, and how much the haircut has to be. LTCM had basically no haircuts, yet today an average investor buying regular stocks is subject to a 50% haircut when using those stocks as collateral against the amount borrowed on a margin trading account.\nSo, let's start tying some of this together.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat we know:\n\n1. DTCC is making all bonds below a Aa2/AA rating worthless in MBS repo markets, they're also devaluing AAA/Aa2/AA by 7%.\n2. The DTCC will only do this if they fear foreclosure, or high risk in an asset. In this case Mortgage Backed Securities and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCool, now what has happened, literally tonight?\n\n[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/5/4/MBS981-21.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/5/4/MBS981-21.pdf)\n\nBoFA just shutdown one of it's MBS clearing companies.\n\nBoth of these announcements on 5/4.\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly heads are rolling. Be safe tomorrow apes, we're in the endgame.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Let's get deeper.\n\nThis literally effects ALL bonds, AND securities!

Here's some takeaways. \n\nCalvin was kind enough to let me know a couple of things. One, this hasn't been done before February. This is a new line of credit that was just established post rona.  This was because of something called Reg W (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulation-w.asp#:~:text=Regulation%20W%20is%20a%20U.S.,requires%20collateral%20for%20certain%20transactions.)  \n\nThe list of lenders is updated manually and applications start in early May, hence the update. Two lenders fell off the list this go around so they sent an updated list and re-published it. \n\nFrom the sound of it, there were some issues with Reg W compliance and some of the lenders had to drop off.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo what do we know now, and has my theory altered?\n\nI believe my timeline has altered, unbeknownst to me this program is for the following:\n\n\"How Regulation W Works\nRegulation W was published in 2003, to consolidate rulemaking under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Its main purposes were to protect banks from financial risk resulting from transactions with their affiliates and to limit the banks' ability to use the U.S. deposit insurance system to cover their losses from such transactions.\"\n\nand \n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section23a.htm (Very long read)\n\n\nAlrighty, final theory.\n\nEvent#1: \n\nMichael Burry dropping hints\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/mh4nkb/michael_burrys_new_twitter_profile_banner_hinting/\n\nAfter researching, from what I can tell, our hero was back at it again blowing the whistle this time to the public via code. In the post above, it shows his final twitter header before deleting his twitter. The one previous to that, was simply a picture of bricks and mortar. My assumption is he was alluding to the CMBS fraud that got whistle blown about last year.\n\nEvent #2:\n\nOkay so, last year a whistleblower goes the the SEC and says \"Hey! They fraudin again!\"\nhttps://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-62\n\nEvent #3:\n\nSEC starts looking into it, sees the fraud, and calls the DTCCs. Once they investigate and collaborate they start rolling out changes late December. Hence the bond ratings changing overnight. \n\nMore whistleblowers come out as they realize the music is ending and they'll make more than they would've bonused. \n\nEvent#4: \n\nTBD\n\n\nThat's all I got for now folks, seems to be huge news even though it did occur already. I think we may be seeing the effects of this play out over the rest of this year so keep your nose to the ground. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n**I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor.
