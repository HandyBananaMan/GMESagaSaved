What if Citadel has dirt on the DTCC and that's why they're letting this shit go on?\n\nMy first thought was to look into any relationship between Kenny G and Michael Bodson, head of DTCC.\n\n**\\*Insert 20 mins of DD, found no initial Kenny/Mikey connection, then decided to look into Mr DTCC's LinkedIn page\\***\n\nMichael Bodson worked for Morgan Stanley for 20 years from  Jun 1986 - Jul 2006.

The current COO of Citadel was on the board of directors at the DTCC while serving as CFO at the time.\n\nThat's the last piece of the puzzle for me. I don't need to look any further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let's review what we've learned:\n\nThe DTCC AND Citadel are both almost entirely made up of people who worked at a company called PwC which profited 322M from Lehman's collapse.\n\nFormer employees going back and forth between all 3 companies. Would be super simple to share information and palm favors.\n\nLike for example..\n\n**Easily approving financial statements when Citadel obviously does SHADY SHIT**:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1146184/000114618419000002/CDRG\\_BS\\_ONLY\\_2018.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1146184/000114618419000002/CDRG_BS_ONLY_2018.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Did ya'll even read anything? I bet you didn't. I bet you just approved their financials and ignored all their naked shorting over the years because Cindy gave you a BJ at a frat party in 89'.](https://preview.redd.it/xnicek7l6fx61.jpg?width=1398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fafdb5516b9e0beec00a8b789311157b2ab245f0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started this trying to find a connection between Kenny and Michael but found myself going down a rabbit hole that any normal sane person would be terrified to post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[lmao last time I posted something like this, I got death threats. This one might be legit.. Pray for me guyz.](https://preview.redd.it/0t8g7tswcfx61.jpg?width=1223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d46227fa9df5dd28a41b4e02f8e8e875b0fe879d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust for shits and giggles let's see how far PwC is from Citadel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MOTHER OF GOD](https://preview.redd.it/k8nboe66zex61.jpg?width=1484&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61865d4886121f7ed2ceefb5cf067f3483fe20b2)\n\n12 minute walk from PwC to Citadel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is just my opinion but based on this information, I think this is the reason why things have been moving so slowly. This mini shadow organization that's made up of all these people who worked for the same firms, even interns went from 0 to 100 real quick. High ranking positions, probably as puppets for a larger entity. *\"Do this and that when we tell you to, and on paper you'll be kings and queens\"*\n\nWhat does this mean? What is the point?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on the proposed legislation changes, it appears to me that someone's tired of their shit. And closing in on them little by little and they're running around terrified someone's gonna see through all their shady activities.\n\nIf I'm right, and they realized shit was about to hit the fan, they'd probably be...... up late.... on the weekends.... shredding all evidence of their fuckery.......... Hey wait, aren't there pics of lights on at all these buildings???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: A company called PwC profited 322M Euros off the collapse of Lehman Brother's. This company had many many employees who went from working at PwC straight to DTCC and Citadel. PwC is 12 minutes walk from Citadel. The head of DTCC Michael Bodson used to work at PwC and Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns. He started working for DTCC the same month banks started to shit themselves, March 2007.**\n\n**Gamestop is 2008 pt 2. Same players. Same tactics. Same strategies. Different company names. The end is near for all of them and they're most likely all freaking the fuck out worse than we thought. HODL.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Edit: Thanks for the awards but I'd rather ya'll spend those on GME.*\n\n*Message to Citadel, PwC, DTCC, whoever else is involved:*\n\n*Yo, maybe I'm completely wrong. Who knows. BUT the longer this shit goes on, the deeper we apes will be looking. And we're retarded. We can't help ourselves. We'll keep looking and looking and pointing shit out. We are the uncomfortable autistic child in the room saying very uncomfortable things that the adults don't want known publicly.*\n\n*Everyone knows you're doing some kinda shady shit, no one can definitively prove any of it but... SOONER OR LATER we're gonna stumble on something LEGIT Legit. And it's gonna fuck you up real bad. Worse than what ever covering would cost you. So you're better off just covering so we take our tendies and go.*\n\nEdit 2:\n\nOf course shills are gonna shill. Ape they are the 4 big accounting firms. DUH that's the point. One or more of them are in on this bullshit but PwC did the last opinion on them. PwC has deeper ties. PwC as a whole may not be in on it, I'm saying a few key employees could easily do favors. Theres major corruption. Shills are missing the point that Citadel and DTCC are intimate together. Idgaf about PwC I'm saying this is a tie to DTCC and Citadel.",
