    "selftext": "I want to start off this post by saying that I am not a financial advisor.  All of this should be taken with a grain of salt.  Do your own research to back up beliefs you may have about the stock that you like.  I will site sources I used at the end with links.\n\nI heard a couple of people, including Pixel, mention a few things about VIX, which is a volatility index that was created back in 1993 with the goal of giving real time analysis to market expectations of possible near-term price movements of the market.  Pixel was the first person I heard personally that mentioned it as something to look at for a guideline of market sentiment.  So occasionally I would sneak a peek of what was happening based of sentiment I could feel from r/GME and r/Superstonk.\n\nThen yesterday, 5/4, I decided to check it again.  Needless to say, my tits were jacked.\n\nOpen up a banana and crack open a cold Fresca, cause it's about to get deep MF.\n\nBefore I get into all that though, I want to give you a little background on VIX and why we can view it as reliable for predicting short term price movement based off historical data and major historical events.  Then we will see if VIX has any correlation to price movement in GME and see if we can predict any possible events that may be coming (aka when moon).\n\nSo first some background.\n\nVix was created back in 1993 by Cboe (originally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) which changed its name back in 2017.  The Cboe was founded in 1973 and is the world's largest options exchange.  Really what VIX calculates is not volatility but instead the expectation of possible future volatility or implied volatility.  Originally when it started it took into consideration the implied volatility of 8 separate S&amp;amp;amp;amp;P 100 put and call options but then expanded in 2002 to the S&amp;amp;amp;amp;P 500 for more accuracy.\n\nSo how does this whole thing work \ud83e\udd8d?  I'm glad you asked.\n\nTwo methods are used.\n\n1. They perform calculations based on historical prices over a specific period of time.  Basically they find things like an average, mean, variance, and historical deviation on the data sets.  This allows them to calculate the risk.  Any time you want to know the future of a stock, you can go off the baseline of what it's done in let's say the last couple months and go off of that.  So they do that and take past data to find future implied volatility.\n2. They infer that value of the stock based off of option prices.  Option prices are made according to the probability of it reaching it's strike price before it expires.  So to calculate the price of these options in most cases, the possibility of it reaching that set price is represented by a volatility factor and dictates the price of such options.  Since option prices are available to the open market, they are able to be used for data.  Boom, more data to show movement in pricing or implied volatility.\n\nOkay so you grew a few wrinkles right?  Now how accurate is this fancy thing?  Get ready to look at some data with me.\n\nI poured over some historical data correlating to historical events.  [Here is a link to the raw data.](https://cdn.cboe.com/api/global/us_indices/daily_prices/VIX_History.csv)\n\nHere's some examples.\n\n2001 WTC Attack in NYC\n\nDATE,OPEN,HIGH,LOW,CLOSE\n\n08/31/2001,25.310000,25.470000,24.410000,24.920000 09/04/2001,26.110000,26.170000,24.190000,25.850000 09/05/2001,26.220000,27.370000,26.220000,26.350000 09/06/2001,27.230000,28.730000,27.230000,28.610000 09/07/2001,29.890000,31.300000,28.920000,30.990000 09/10/2001,33.110000,33.340000,31.840000,31.840000 09/17/2001,43.200000,44.330000,39.770000,41.760000 09/18/2001,41.070000,42.170000,38.870000,38.870000 09/19/2001,37.880000,44.260000,37.500000,40.560000\n\nLiterally before 9-11-2001, they were showing implied volatility and then there was a massive jump on recorded date, 9-17-2001.

Now there's a pretty sizable jump in implied volatility.  I'm keeping an eye on VIX from here on out that's for sure.  (It's able to be seen on Yahoo Finance and you can follow it right along with GME.  Not sure how else but that's the easiest way I've found)\n\nNow time for my opinion on what we could possibly see.  This is purely speculation and just my thoughts.\n\nAfter looking at all the historical data, my thoughts are that anything over 30 for VIX is significant.  But really it's not about those big jumps, because those are just days that there is massive movement.  It's really about those days leading up and seeing a steady climb in VIX that's telling.  I personally think that whatever is about to happen is going to bring a massive market crash, larger than at least the one last year.  I feel that if we see VIX rise past the 24-26 mark for a high on the day, and stay around there for maybe 2 or more days (May not even be needed.  It could be a major quick jump, like a rocket launch?), then it's about to go down.  THAT is why my tits are jacked.\n\nTL;DR: Please just try to read the most you can because it's pretty awesome to see.  The VIX shows the implied volatility for the markets based off the S&amp;amp;amp;amp;P 500 and can accurately predict major movements that will happen in the market.  VIX has a direct correlation with GME rapid movement.  Today there was a massive jump in VIX.  I predict more to come.  Just buy, hodl, vote.  \n\nGround Control to Major Tom....\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[VIX Historical Data](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/vix_historical_data/)\n\n[VIX Volatility Chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2603/vix-volatility-index-historical-chart)\n\n[Info About What VIX IS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vix.asp)",
