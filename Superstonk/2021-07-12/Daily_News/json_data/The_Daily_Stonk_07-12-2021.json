Shorts have not covered\n3. Gamestop Corp is working with the SEC\n4. They have been turning the company around, this takes time.\n5. They've introduced new rulings to make shorting harder\n6. There are currently somewhere between 80 and 100 million shares in the option chain.\n\nOk so knowing that lets look at something simple, Delayed Gratification, this takes time and if you're not used to doing the most simple fucking thing ever I feel for you son, but I got 99 problems and patience aint one.\n\nSeriously it's simple, Buy hold wait till it goes pop, that's it.\n\nSo... \"I'm tired\" \"this needs to end\" \"this is blablabla\", if all you can do is complain about other people beeing excited or looking forward to a certain week, just look away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fyrhk3d9cra71.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=537461ee680fe8b878c4f128cda9b715a56cad29\n\nSo lets keep it simple\n\nI can be excited to see what comes this week, but at the same time remain realistic about what's going to happen.\n\nSo lets take the 14th as an example:\n\nWe have been looking to the 14th as a date that something will happen, because of the Crypto data (which is now been debunked by the lead blockchain, to be part of the upgrade to Etherium 2.0)\n\nBut we looked forward to the 14th, due to the crypto date, and the tweets.  \nI'm excited to see what may happen, but at the same time I'm realistic and expect nothing to happen, because if something does happends I'll be ok, and if the moass starts I won't be taken by surprise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I personally believe what may be happening this week:  \nThe new rules have been put in place to overlook the hedgefunds, and make naked shorting/selling harder to do.  \nSo all the puts/calls expiring on friday they'll have to try and kick the can again, but this is the first time with so many with the new rules, so the SEC is just looking at this and checking how it will happen, how they can kick the can further, then they'll patch the holes and perhaps take action?\n\nwho knows, either way I'm jacked for the week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2xm4o97dra71.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec1b8ebf485d613d3feb4976637e9ea74543d6cc\n\n# Gamestop Blockchain\n\nJordan  Holberg made an article  on his work on wizards of the coasts (magic the gathering) and how stuff like NFT's work great for this.\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg)\n\nAlso because we've had some people say you couldn't combine actual physical products with NFT's, I present to you....
