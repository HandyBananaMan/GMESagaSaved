 Good Morning San Diago,

I am Rensole and this is your daily news.

Does anyone smell that?

The exponential floor seems to still not be on track, not sure on how or when a new theory is going to bring itself forward but it seems interesting nonetheless imo

# Toroso Investments LLC Makes New $923,000 Investment in GameStop Corp

The site in and of itself is looking off imo, and as u/ammoprofit posted in a comment on there:

So even if this information is spread please be sure to check out the source and not take everything for granted, this could be real or it could be bullshit for all we know, so for now take it with a grain of salt ðŸ˜‰

# Anti hype sentiment

Ok let's do a little one on this, first of all I've been seeing a lot of people from Gme\_meltdown come over and complain how everything is a let down and everything is bs and bla bla fucking bla.

Lets make a few things clear.

1. no dates are set in stone  
We don't know when it will happen but we can be excited because we believe it could happen around specific dates
2. Shorts have not covered
3. Gamestop Corp is working with the SEC
4. They have been turning the company around, this takes time.
5. They've introduced new rulings to make shorting harder
6. There are currently somewhere between 80 and 100 million shares in the option chain.

Ok so knowing that lets look at something simple, Delayed Gratification, this takes time and if you're not used to doing the most simple fucking thing ever I feel for you son, but I got 99 problems and patience aint one.

Seriously it's simple, Buy hold wait till it goes pop, that's it.

So... "I'm tired" "this needs to end" "this is blablabla", if all you can do is complain about other people beeing excited or looking forward to a certain week, just look away.

&#x200B;

So lets keep it simple

I can be excited to see what comes this week, but at the same time remain realistic about what's going to happen.

So lets take the 14th as an example:

We have been looking to the 14th as a date that something will happen, because of the Crypto data (which is now been debunked by the lead blockchain, to be part of the upgrade to Etherium 2.0)

But we looked forward to the 14th, due to the crypto date, and the tweets.  
I'm excited to see what may happen, but at the same time I'm realistic and expect nothing to happen, because if something does happends I'll be ok, and if the moass starts I won't be taken by surprise.

&#x200B;

What I personally believe what may be happening this week:  
The new rules have been put in place to overlook the hedgefunds, and make naked shorting/selling harder to do.  
So all the puts/calls expiring on friday they'll have to try and kick the can again, but this is the first time with so many with the new rules, so the SEC is just looking at this and checking how it will happen, how they can kick the can further, then they'll patch the holes and perhaps take action?

who knows, either way I'm jacked for the week.

# Gamestop Blockchain

Jordan  Holberg made an article  on his work on wizards of the coasts (magic the gathering) and how stuff like NFT's work great for this.

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magic-gathering-multiverse-metaverse-jordan-holberg)

Also because we've had some people say you couldn't combine actual physical products with NFT's, I present to you.... THE DODGERS

They're offering an NFT with a Physical world series ring.... now how could this be used in gaming.... oh yeah.

Also our in house  u/Dismal-Jellyfish has made a thread about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oi6lhy/nft_economy_update_a_deeper_dive_with_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
