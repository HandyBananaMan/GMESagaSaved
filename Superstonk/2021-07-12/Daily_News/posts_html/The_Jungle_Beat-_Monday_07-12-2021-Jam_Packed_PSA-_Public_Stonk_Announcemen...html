<h1>FSOC Meeting this Friday to discuss "Climate Changes"</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/fsoc/council-meetings">This Friday continues a series of meetings held by Janet Yellen and her Financial Stability Oversight Council.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Friday, July 16, Secretary Janet L. Yellen will preside over an executive meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) by videoconference.  The preliminary agenda includes Federal Reserve stress tests, housing markets, and the proposed Council report to be issued under the Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/"><strong>Here's the relevant executive order, which does address actual climate issues affecting supply chain, etc.</strong></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhw44x/wondering_where_tf_the_sec_is_the_financial/">I actually wrote a DD on the FSOC back in March, which can be found here.</a> Here's the text from the original post (quoted so you can skip if you like)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: POLITICS ARE DISCUSSED, BUT ONLY ON AN UNBIASED, FACTUAL LEVEL. NO PARTISAN POLITICS HERE!</strong> I’m even leaving some details out to avoid saying certain names to trigger argument or auto mod. Anyways...  </p>
<p>I haven’t seen this talked about anywhere so I want to make sure apes are aware of what’s going on on a Federal level right now in the USA. We’re all wondering where the actual FUCK the SEC is in all this, and I think I may have found a clue.  </p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called a random ass <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/fsoc/council-meetings">meeting of the minds</a>  </p>
<p>yesterday in the form of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) which was established in 2010. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/min0gb/the_holders_of_the_boss_key_wondering_who_is_at/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">List of members in attendance</a> I’m not getting out in the weeds with technicals here, that’s what these other smart apes are here for. Just know that this group, a panel that consists of top regulators from SEC, Fed Reserve, NYSE, and Big Brother alphabet forces... has been tasked with <strong>Policing Wall Street Behavior that has the potential to crash the entire economy.</strong> <em>This is not a new statement, but it is relevant to why it was revived.</em>  </p>
<p>Now, the mainstream media keeps saying that the focus of this meeting was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/yellen-climate-change-fsoc-478769">climate change</a>  </p>
<p>(insert eye roll for buzzwords- it’s also carefully worded to say a market crash could be caused by the aftermath of the pandemic) but some interesting things have developed from it. Jerome Powell, the Fed Reserve Chair (the guy that makes the money printer go brrrrr) has “presided over the formation of 2 internal committees on “climate risk”- one on issues of relevance to bank examiners, and <em>the other on potential risks posed to the stability of the entire financial system</em>, the type that’s of most interest to FSOC.  </p>
<p>Now, the good shit... The climate change part was an open meeting. But the meeting’s agenda included a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/yellen-signals-scrutinizing-hedge-funds-is-a-renewed-fsoc-focus-kmxuj4hu">closed door deliberation</a>  </p>
<p>on open end mutual funds and hedge fund activities. Janet Yellen said she is re-establishing the “Hedge Fund Working Group”- a 2008-2016 era team of high officials within the council that will <em>scrutinize hedge funds in particular</em>, and will also look at ways of making funding markets that serve as the lifeblood of the financial sector more resilient. <strong>THE LAST TIME THIS GROUP MET WAS IN 2016</strong>.  </p>
<p><a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/TreasuryStatement.pdf">Here's the press release</a>  </p>
<p>Also of note from the document:  </p>
<p>The group received an updated presentation from the Office of Financial Research about Hedge Fund activities. So they got to sit through a hedgie slideshow of fuckery. (Do you think any of our DDs made it on a slide? 🧐😂)  </p>
<p><strong>“The council also discussed recent market developments related to hedge fund activities”</strong>  </p>
<p>“Chairperson Yellen asked interagency staff to assess potential financial stability risks associated with open-end funds, particularly focusing on <strong>LIQUIDITY RISKS</strong>.”  </p>
<p>So, why am I posting this here? What does this have to do with GME? Well, nothing directly. At least, not as presented. First of all, words have meaning in a legal document, every single one. And I noticed a few little blips that refer to CURRENT MARKET FUCKERY BEING INVESTIGATED. I know the press is covering this meeting as just another day at the office for Yellen, but IT HASN’T MET SINCE 2016. WHY NOW?!?! <em>political speculation gets involved here and thats not what this post is about. I'm not saying it's directly because of GME, but it sure seems to be a sudden priority in a notoriously slow responding gov't</em>  </p>
<p>Do the cops release details when they’re investigating a murder? No. Then the murderer might destroy the weapon and flee the country, maybe even burn down the neighborhood while he’s at it. You don’t show your hand at the poker table til the dealing’s done.  </p>
<p>My opinion as a crayon smoking apette? I think the Everything Short DD was spot on. I think Michael Burry has been trying to warn us for 18+ months that it’s imminent... and I think the US government is trying to get ahead of a fucking speeding freight train headed directly for our $USD. They have every reason to stop this cancer before it fully penetrates and evaporates US treasury bonds. I think they’ve known since pre-January squeeze that this was inevitable, but our little diamond hands on our GME just forced their hand. THIS IS NOT RETAIL INVESTOR’S FAULT. We didn’t create this, and we aren’t responsible for the resulting explosion just because we are the ones that exposed the fuckery! We are individual investors with individual reasons for liking the stock.  </p>
<p>But boy, oh boy do I like it more every day.  </p>
<p>💎🙌🏼🚀  </p>
<p>TL;DR: Remember❗Hedgies aren't just shorting GME to oblivion. They've been doing this to US Treasury Bonds. Particularly 10 year ones. If that implodes, then the government can no longer guarantee the value of its own dollar, because those "insurance policies" i.e. US bonds are worthless=Dollar go boom 💥 Treasury Secretary Yellen called a meeting to seemingly stop that boom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So now we see another meeting coming up this Friday going on about "Climate Change". Here's the thing- as several users around the sub have mentioned in recent conversation, this is a clever use of the word "climate" imo because it indirectly references the broiling economic climate that's about to bubble over. Sort of a wink-nudge, if you ask me.</p>
<p>Now, as user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Snowbagels/">u/Snowbagels</a> pointed out;</p>
<p>Follow the asterisk after “Climate-Related Financial Risks” and you’ll find this disclaimer:</p>
<p><em>“ In accordance with the Council’s Transparency Policy, which is available at</em> <a href="http://www.fsoc.gov/"><em>www.fsoc.gov</em></a><em>, the meeting will be held in a closed session to prevent the potential disclosure of information contained in or related to investigation, examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial markets or financial institutions; information which would lead to significant financial speculation, significantly endanger the stability of any financial market or financial institution, or significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action; information exempted from disclosure by statute or by regulation, or authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret; trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not otherwise be available by law; and to conduct administrative business of the Council.”</em></p>

<h1>PSA- Public Stonk Announcement</h1>
<p><em>New addition to automod's banned words list, post flairs, user flairs, and more</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>New Addition to Automod Banned Words List- Infinity Pool</strong></p>
<p>In moderating this sub and the the regular attacks placed against it, we have to remain ever-vigilant against subtle attempts to undermine us and our like of the stock. As a mod, you have to stay pretty proactive about what needs to be done to protect the members of this community and the next FUD attack coming around the corner.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So in the past we have warned of the use of third party links, clarified the use of the terms "we" and "us", and reiterated the fact that we do not have a leader in this group that speaks for the collective community. We just like the stock. Well, today I am issuing an official warning about the use of the term "infinity pool".</p>
<p>The moderators and members of this sub do NOT collectively agree to ANYTHING regarding the buying and selling of $GME stock. We do agree that buying the dip is a value at current and recent prices, and we all genuinely believe in the long term value of the company with Ryan Cohen at the helm of the renaissance of our beloved gaming store. For that, you will see this community reference holding. It's a common trader sentiment towards the stock they love, originating from the man Warren Buffet, himself. And it's far from illegal.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/u5864c0ytsa71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8d0f2438ae266ab050b74be4ff306c5e79af889</p>
<p>But the campaign for "infinity pool" being introduced into our popular culture has been on this pink cat's sus list since the first time I saw it. It's been a subtle campaign for some time, and however innocent its roots may be, it's time to stop the discussion. Again, the members of this sub do not collectively agree on any certain amount of shares being held for any certain amount of time. If you have 1 share and never want to sell it, awesome! If you have 100 shares but 69 of them will always remain in your possession, that's a cool story, bro! But positions aren't discussed here, and we just have a general sentiment that we really like the stock and some of us will likely hold it long term, just as Warren Buffet advises.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/vqle2ud1usa71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3718f31355f6109d8f76ed319a8f56bac5ae20b0">Even Warren Buffet, himself says that this is the key to wealth- buy and hold. So of course, that sentiment is seen all over this sub. </a></p>
<p>As such, the term "infinity pool" and all discussions referencing it are now in the banned words list. We do however still welcome the discussion of using the long-term buy and hold strategy that has proven successful for so many investors. Thank you for understanding our diligence in protecting you apes and this sub. 💖🐈</p>

<p><strong>Using and sorting by Post Flairs, with updates in the works</strong></p>
<p>There has been recent discussion in the community around the proper use of post flairs- namely, the DD and Possible DD flairs. As the hard-hitting due diligence wanes and more varying schools of thought begin to fill the "hot" section of the DD flairs, I wanted to let you know that the mod team, led by the suggestions of the DD specialists within, are discussing and reviewing how we can update the current post flair system to properly reflect the content we are currently seeing in the sub, while also allowing for those who may wish to filter out certain schools of thought, to do so.</p>
<p>Having said that, I want to remind veterans and newbies alike that you can always filter posts by post flair. Clicking the "DD" or "Meme" or "Fluff" flair under a post will direct you to only posts on the sub with that flair. It's great for if you're trying to only view certain content! Although you should note that at this time, there is no way to filter out an "everything but" scenario (for instance if you want to see everything but memes). If I am wrong, please let me know in the comments below, but as for right now, I have nooooooo clue how to do that 🙃</p>
<p>Also let us know how you'd like to see the post flairs restructured in the comments. There are a few posts arguing both changing the current post flair system, and keeping it the same:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oic6c9/any_dd_should_have_a_speculation_flair_until_it/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">This post is FOR changing the system</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oink7s/counterpoint_our_dd_system_is_fine_heres_why/">This post says don't change it</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>User Flairs 💎🙌🚀</strong></p>
<p>As I'm sure all you dear readers are aware, I have sort of dubbed myself the Superstonk Flairy, and I genuinely love to bless every ape I can with a lovely custom flair. It's definitely my favorite part of being moderator, which probably sounds incredibly silly, but hear me out.</p>
<p>I know how much it means to get a custom flair in the community you love, one which will likely go down in history books as one of the fucking weirdest things that ever happened in human kind (👁👅👁 <em>rick</em>) but also one of the purest and most excellent collections of the enduring human spirit there ever was. So I'm down to keep slinging dope flairs everyday until my wrists give out, and come back tomorrow and do it again. The !powerup! flair and the !apevote! flair, they have been part of this story and are almost like timestamps in this saga. And I love seeing all the crazy creative tags you apes come up with. Y'all are one-of-a-kind, and it's a small token of community that gives us a sense of belonging, an identity, a place. Plus they look fookin rad.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sappy shit outta the way, I can't ever possibly get to all of you on any given post. And I genuinely feel bad about that most the time. Having said that, I really only carve out time for flairs on Friday. So please don't be offended if I don't get to flair you!! I don't miss anyone intentionally and I WILL GET TO YOU ALL SOMEDAY I SWEAR ✌💖🐈</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can still comment <strong>!powerup!</strong> for the Power to the Players flair!</p>
