<p>Regardless of price movements, however long it takes to close, shorts are in debt to you if you hold GME.</p>
<p>If you hold one synthetic share, they owe you one share, that they don't have. You're in control and you decide exactly when their offer meets your demand.</p>
<p>They will try to drag this out as long as possible, by any means necessary, to get you to accept a lower price. That's all there is to it. It's a game of chicken.</p>
