Regardless of price movements, however long it takes to close, shorts are in debt to you if you hold GME.

If you hold one synthetic share, they owe you one share, that they don't have. You're in control and you decide exactly when their offer meets your demand.

They will try to drag this out as long as possible, by any means necessary, to get you to accept a lower price. That's all there is to it. It's a game of chicken.
