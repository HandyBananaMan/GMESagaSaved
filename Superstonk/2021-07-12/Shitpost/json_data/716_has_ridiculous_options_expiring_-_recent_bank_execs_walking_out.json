    "selftext": "I'm not saying anything especially dates - cause no dates.\n\nBut there's no way they can roll any more shorts into more FTD cycles. Regulations have largely stopped it now we've been hoping.\n\nSo +300k options expire; gotta get filled - no one is lending out anymore (to short) - we've seen the unbelievably low trading volume recently. T+2 brings us to 7/20.\n\nWhat's on that day? Moon Jam. Now I'm not saying we're going to MOASS; but just perfect timing to place an \"apes going to the moon\" themed Moon party. Now I DON'T know the significance of a whole month to August 20th; but I'm sure there's a reason. \n\nI'm not saying a party \"themed going to the moon\" is going to be us going to the Moon...\n\nBut if I had any sort of intelligent logic - even after seeing bank execs walking out and leaving the past few days...I'm just saying - if I were ever a gambler I would wager that is MOASS launch date.\n\nBut no dates! I'm just saying. The writing is on the fucking wall. Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse will be vaporized soon as the next Lehman Brothers.\n\nJP Morgan maybe not far behind - they've liquidated since March. SEC and DOJ has long been investigating APEX.\n\nWe've seen \"institutions\" charged with securities fraud in the news lately. We're here. Warm up your fryers.\n\nFriday might be your last day to get more nuggets for the Summer Sale. Monday or Tuesday morning (7/20) if you got some serious diamond balls and wanna risk the discount. \n\nIt's Tendie Time.\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf57 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd8d\u2197\ufe0f\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a",
