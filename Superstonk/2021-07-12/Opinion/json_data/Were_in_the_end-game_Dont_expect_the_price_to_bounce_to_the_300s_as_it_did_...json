The day they're buying is everyday trying not to let the price rise to margin call territory. Before, as they only had a monthly account check, they could let the price reach the 300's for a few days, but not anymore.\n\nThey are using everything they have left to avoid the price rising. We're in the endgame (again), they can't keep the price below 200 forever. Hodl, that's all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: typos.",
