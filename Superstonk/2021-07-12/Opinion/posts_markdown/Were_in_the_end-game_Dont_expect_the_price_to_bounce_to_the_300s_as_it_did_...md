Since the  NSCC-2021-002 rule became effective (montly to daily or anytime check account + 1 hour margin call), they can't allow the price to rise to XXX (can be 250, can be 350, no one knows). The day they're buying is everyday trying not to let the price rise to margin call territory. Before, as they only had a monthly account check, they could let the price reach the 300's for a few days, but not anymore.

They are using everything they have left to avoid the price rising. We're in the endgame (again), they can't keep the price below 200 forever. Hodl, that's all.
