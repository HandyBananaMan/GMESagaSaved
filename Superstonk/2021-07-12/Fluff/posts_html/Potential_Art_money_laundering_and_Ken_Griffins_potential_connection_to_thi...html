<p>I’m going to put this up with fluff because this is a speculation, due to multiple factors.</p>
<p>1.) Ken Griffin is deep into the contemporary art market</p>
<p>2.) It is a known secret that billionaires spend millions upon millions to buy art and don’t even look at it. It just stays in a vault in Switzerland and just gets passed around inside the bank to avoid taxes</p>
<p>3.) there is an interesting book about it called Boom: Mad Money, Mega Dealers, and the Rise of Contemporary Art that goes into this exact thing.</p>
<p>4.) If you’re a billionaire and have heavily invested into Art it’s weirder if you didn’t do this</p>
<p>TL;CR potential future speculative flared post about Ken Griffin and Tax dodging into the Art market</p>
<p>Edit: Tax dodging not money laundering. Since the money is already legally earned, it doesn’t fit the description of what they’re doing.</p>
