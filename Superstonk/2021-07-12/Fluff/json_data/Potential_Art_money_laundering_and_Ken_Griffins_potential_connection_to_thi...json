    "selftext": "I\u2019m going to put this up with fluff because this is a speculation, due to multiple factors.\n\n1.) Ken Griffin is deep into the contemporary art market\n\n2.) It is a known secret that billionaires spend millions upon millions to buy art and don\u2019t even look at it. It just stays in a vault in Switzerland and just gets passed around inside the bank to avoid taxes\n\n3.) there is an interesting book about it called Boom: Mad Money, Mega Dealers, and the Rise of Contemporary Art that goes into this exact thing.\n\n4.) If you\u2019re a billionaire and have heavily invested into Art it\u2019s weirder if you didn\u2019t do this\n\nTL;CR potential future speculative flared post about Ken Griffin and Tax dodging into the Art market\n\nEdit: Tax dodging not money laundering. Since the money is already legally earned, it doesn\u2019t fit the description of what they\u2019re doing.",
