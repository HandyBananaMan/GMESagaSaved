<p>In counterpoint to u/PWNWTFBBQ ‘s post on the state of DD in this sub.  </p>
<h2>Acknowledge</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, let’s acknowledge their accurate point that putting “DD” or “possible DD” on posts is totally open.  Anyone can do it.  I did it for this post.  Is it DD?  <img alt="**No.**" src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/483/348/bdd.jpg" />  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, this sub is known to have bad actors in it.  Shills.  Posts of comments.  Re-posts.  Is there a possibility of diluting the quality of the DD?  Maybe.  (I’ll go more into this in a minute.)  But is there a real threat of low quality DD being posted for ulterior motives?  Absolutely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, are there assholes on this sub?  Yes.  Am I one of them?  Depends.  I mean... we all have bad days.  Do some people have a hard time being publicly corrected, or just, corrected at all?  Do some people not want to admit to being wrong?  Absolutely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, are we publicly playing against semi-disclosed players with undisclosed positions hidden in deep regulatory strata?  Yes.  Is there a lot of <em>accurate</em> information available? Not really.  There are excellent <em>views</em> here, which are supported by meaningful data, but much of what we are doing is interpretive.  My own research-driven, actual DD is included in this statement (I spent my free time today reading HBS research papers on market structure for Part 3 of “The Sun Never Sets on Citadel”.  How was your Sunday?)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>However...</h2>
<p>But let’s get to the question: <strong><em>why do we need posts to be marked as DD in the first place?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I put DD on my posts to show that I did what I thought was research, and I found something which I think the larger community would want to know.  That’s it. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But it looks like a subset on r/Superstonk think that the DD tag is a signal for</strong> <strong><em>reverence</em></strong> <strong>for the posts</strong>.  To them, DD is a moniker for substance, and they are disappointed when the DD doesn’t meet up to their standards.  To them, if the post falls flat, is downright wrong, or worse, the OP is an asshole who doesn’t admit that it’s flatly downright wrong – then it doesn’t deserve the DD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>I disagree.  Full stop.  Fuck reverence.</h1>

<li>
<p>First, Superstonk DD is effective because of <strong>open accountability</strong>.  Meaning, DD is available for review by all.  I recognize u/atobitt’s name for his foundational work, even though I have a hard time remembering if it’s 2 “b”s or 2 “t”s when I’m trying to type it out.  <strong>His work stands on its own merits, and he includes his sources and references for all to see.</strong>  If he does shitty work, anyone can see it, critique it, and understand why it’s shitty.  Even u/atobitt is subject to criticism.  Nobody rests on their laurels.  <strong>Every DD is publicly accountable to anyone.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, Superstonk DD is effective because <strong>we already have a really effective system in place.</strong>  Our sub’s best DD is also our most awarded, upvoted, and referenced.  If you’re worried about shitty DD getting 100 awards – don’t worry, memes of Legos will get as many before they are both completely forgotten.  The best DD rises to the top, stays, gets referenced, shared, saved, printed out, framed, etc.  And by the way – not all good DD is the same.  Some DD is technical, niche, or isn’t written with everyone in mind.  <strong>The most popular DD is popular because it is meaningful to the <em>whole</em> community and the <em>whole</em> cause of $GME.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, Superstonk DD is effective because of <strong>open contribution.</strong>  I didn’t notify anyone when I posted DD.  There was no gatekeeper.  Several people have pinged me with their DD and the info they are working through.  Some of it is legit; some sucks.  <strong>I love it all.  This sub is about people trying.  And trying means we get it wrong.</strong>  I welcome feedback on mine (when I’m not an asshole).  But I also look back on mine and others and see how <strong>we didn’t quite have the whole picture, but we were better for trying to find it.  Even when we got it wrong along the way.</strong>  FYI There are really well-written, supported, highly awarded DD posts that point to MOASS happening this past April.  They were wrong.  But they were right to contribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, Superstonk DD works because <strong>we are about community.</strong>  I love the low-quality, shitty DD maybe written by a shill or a fourteen year-old with MS paint. (Guys, shut up, I know fourteen year olds are way more competent than to use MS paint unironically).  But I love it because subconsciously it trains everyone here, gives us a role, and teaches us what to do.  We’ve all seen post after post talking about how people feel a part of this community.  It’s important that we all learn not to revere DD because of the moniker, but be better at judging it, getting a sense for the intentions of it.  It’s important that each of our judgment on a DD is registered, because it might be meaningful to us in a way.  It’s important that we don’t expect others to do the thinking for us.  Each of these activities continues to knit our experiences together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>I can see many ways how a well-intentioned “DD approval” system would do more to kill the research in this sub than any hedgie campaign ever could.</strong>  </li>
<li>I’m happy to contribute my voice in setting up any new process, but my resources are limited (and everyone knows the mods’ time is too – thank you mods).  </li>
<li>It's one thing if there is an unprecedented, overwhelming abuse of the DD flair that will exceed our mod’s and Satori’s capacity to respond - that is a separate issue.  </li>
<li>But if we are “armchairing” our DD system to say that kids these days don’t write good DD… then find a new slant.  The good shit still gets to the top.  The bad shit gets 2 front page posts calling it out, with more awards than the actual bad posts themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <strong>bad DD is GREAT because it teaches us us that the only real true trustworthy info is BUY and HODL.</strong>  </p>
<p>I am happy to be wrong in my assumptions and views here.  But I post this openly, trusting in this community to beat the shit out of my karma if I’m wrong.</p>
