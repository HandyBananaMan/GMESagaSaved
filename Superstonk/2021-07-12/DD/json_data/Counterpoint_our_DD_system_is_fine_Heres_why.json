    "selftext": "In counterpoint to u/PWNWTFBBQ \u2018s post on the state of DD in this sub.  \n \n##Acknowledge\n \n* First, let\u2019s acknowledge their accurate point that putting \u201cDD\u201d or \u201cpossible DD\u201d on posts is totally open.  Anyone can do it.  I did it for this post.  Is it DD?  [**No.**](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/483/348/bdd.jpg)  \n\n* Second, this sub is known to have bad actors in it.  Shills.  Posts of comments.  Re-posts.  Is there a possibility of diluting the quality of the DD?  Maybe.  (I\u2019ll go more into this in a minute.)  But is there a real threat of low quality DD being posted for ulterior motives?  Absolutely.\n\n* Third, are there assholes on this sub?  Yes.  Am I one of them?  Depends.  I mean... we all have bad days.  Do some people have a hard time being publicly corrected, or just, corrected at all?  Do some people not want to admit to being wrong?  Absolutely.\n\n* Finally, are we publicly playing against semi-disclosed players with undisclosed positions hidden in deep regulatory strata?  Yes.  Is there a lot of *accurate* information available? Not really.  There are excellent *views* here, which are supported by meaningful data, but much of what we are doing is interpretive.  My own research-driven, actual DD is included in this statement (I spent my free time today reading HBS research papers on market structure for Part 3 of \u201cThe Sun Never Sets on Citadel\u201d.  How was your Sunday?)\n \n##However...\n \nBut let\u2019s get to the question: ***why do we need posts to be marked as DD in the first place?***\n\n* I put DD on my posts to show that I did what I thought was research, and I found something which I think the larger community would want to know.  That\u2019s it. \n\n**But it looks like a subset on r/Superstonk think that the DD tag is a signal for** ***reverence*** **for the posts**.  To them, DD is a moniker for substance, and they are disappointed when the DD doesn\u2019t meet up to their standards.  To them, if the post falls flat, is downright wrong, or worse, the OP is an asshole who doesn\u2019t admit that it\u2019s flatly downright wrong \u2013 then it doesn\u2019t deserve the DD.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#I disagree.  Full stop.  Fuck reverence.\n\n&nbsp;\n  \n##[Holup](https://i.redd.it/bwyowwbzmqa71.gif) \n\n1. First, Superstonk DD is effective because of **open accountability**.  Meaning, DD is available for review by all.  I recognize u/atobitt\u2019s name for his foundational work, even though I have a hard time remembering if it\u2019s 2 \u201cb\u201ds or 2 \u201ct\u201ds when I\u2019m trying to type it out.  **His work stands on its own merits, and he includes his sources and references for all to see.**  If he does shitty work, anyone can see it, critique it, and understand why it\u2019s shitty.  Even u/atobitt is subject to criticism.  Nobody rests on their laurels.  **Every DD is publicly accountable to anyone.** \n\n2. Second, Superstonk DD is effective because **we already have a really effective system in place.**  Our sub\u2019s best DD is also our most awarded, upvoted, and referenced.  If you\u2019re worried about shitty DD getting 100 awards \u2013 don\u2019t worry, memes of Legos will get as many before they are both completely forgotten.  The best DD rises to the top, stays, gets referenced, shared, saved, printed out, framed, etc.  And by the way \u2013 not all good DD is the same.  Some DD is technical, niche, or isn\u2019t written with everyone in mind.  **The most popular DD is popular because it is meaningful to the *whole* community and the *whole* cause of $GME.**\n\n3. Third, Superstonk DD is effective because of **open contribution.**  I didn\u2019t notify anyone when I posted DD.  There was no gatekeeper.  Several people have pinged me with their DD and the info they are working through.  Some of it is legit; some sucks.  **I love it all.  This sub is about people trying.  And trying means we get it wrong.**  I welcome feedback on mine (when I\u2019m not an asshole).  But I also look back on mine and others and see how **we didn\u2019t quite have the whole picture, but we were better for trying to find it.  Even when we got it wrong along the way.**  FYI There are really well-written, supported, highly awarded DD posts that point to MOASS happening this past April.  They were wrong.  But they were right to contribute.\n  \n4. Finally, Superstonk DD works because **we are about community.**  I love the low-quality, shitty DD maybe written by a shill or a fourteen year-old with MS paint. (Guys, shut up, I know fourteen year olds are way more competent than to use MS paint unironically).  But I love it because subconsciously it trains everyone here, gives us a role, and teaches us what to do.  We\u2019ve all seen post after post talking about how people feel a part of this community.  It\u2019s important that we all learn not to revere DD because of the moniker, but be better at judging it, getting a sense for the intentions of it.  It\u2019s important that each of our judgment on a DD is registered, because it might be meaningful to us in a way.  It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t expect others to do the thinking for us.  Each of these activities continues to knit our experiences together.\n\n##Conclusion\n\n* **I can see many ways how a well-intentioned \u201cDD approval\u201d system would do more to kill the research in this sub than any hedgie campaign ever could.**  \n* I\u2019m happy to contribute my voice in setting up any new process, but my resources are limited (and everyone knows the mods\u2019 time is too \u2013 thank you mods).  \n* It's one thing if there is an unprecedented, overwhelming abuse of the DD flair that will exceed our mod\u2019s and Satori\u2019s capacity to respond - that is a separate issue.  \n* But if we are \u201carmchairing\u201d our DD system to say that kids these days don\u2019t write good DD\u2026 then find a new slant.  The good shit still gets to the top.  The bad shit gets 2 front page posts calling it out, with more awards than the actual bad posts themselves.\n  \nFinally, **bad DD is GREAT because it teaches us us that the only real true trustworthy info is BUY and HODL.**  \n\nI am happy to be wrong in my assumptions and views here.  But I post this openly, trusting in this community to beat the shit out of my karma if I\u2019m wrong.",
