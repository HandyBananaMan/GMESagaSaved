Constructive criticism is welcome, and I'll try to include any good points brought to my attention with edits.\n\n\n**Algorithm Counter DD**\n\n\n\nAll the algorithm talk is making me, but not just me, concerned. I'm not worried by any of those conclusions, because the methodology appears rooted in conjecture rather than mathematical or logical testing, making them moot. However, because the approach to those conclusions isn't methodological, then incorrect conclusions can just as viably be submitted. Having good information and arriving to correct conclusions reliably is the most important tool which we exercise. If we are to remain on a path of proper discovery and dissemination of information, then we must critically examine submissions about Algorithms\n\n\n\n**What is an algorithm?**\n\na finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a series of computations. If you input a given value or condition into an algorithm, it returns a result based upon the rules that have been established. \n\nExamples of an algorithm:\n\nSimple Example:\n\ny=2x \n\nMore complex example:\n\nwhen x is between 1 and 100, y=2x\nwhen x is less than 1 or greater than 100, y=x\n\nAn algorithm can provide different responses or results based on the input value.\n\n\n\n**When is an algorithm used?**\n\nAn algorithm can be used to perform a series of complex computations or actions within the known set of parameters automatically. The primary function of an algorithm is to save time. A human could manually perform any set of calculations by hand, but a calculator is likely faster. Similarly, an algorithm will save time. In an environment like stocks, the parameters for an algorithm can be super complex while simultaneously executing the results quickly enough to take advantage of the fluctuations  \n\nExample of parameters that *could* be used in trading:\n\nIf: price is > $190 AND\n\nvolume for previous 1 min interval is < 5000\n\nOR \n\nprevious 1 min interval ended with price higher than interval previous\n\nThen: Submit wash sale sufficient to drop price to $190\n\nElse: do nothing\t\n\t\nIf price is < $190 AND\n\nvolume for previous 1 min interval between 5000 and 8000\n\nOR \n\nIt is a Tuesday before end of Quarter\n\nThen: execute buys on private exchange \n\nAND\texecute sells on public exchange\n\nElse: eat mayo with a ladle\n\n\nA post stating to have 'cracked' the algorithm or similar is suggesting they have determined the variations of specifics in the example above. That would require proving mathematically and/or with conditional statement parameters how things are changing. Manually adding lines, manipulating images with overlays, and/or conjecture of overall movement is NOT sufficient for identifying specifics of an algorithm. It's reasonable for us as peer reviewers to expect a DD on an algorithm to clearly define discovered parameters mathematically and/or conditional statements. Then we can test those parameters are by inputting known values and comparing them to the known results.   \n\n\n\n\n**An Algorithm IS NOT** \n\na TI-86 that no one has control over. It is not an out of control AI beyond the ken of mere mortals. It is not static.\n\nBanking/Trading institutions throw tons of cash at the smartest people in their field to create the algorithms that are used. These algorithms are created by individuals, and maintained by individuals, and are not some alien tech or unfathomable science. The people in charge can dictate changes they want to see happen in their approach, and the algorithm is altered to accommodate this change. It's important to know that any given algorithm can be altered, because if it is immutable, then it can eventually be discovered by competition, who you can bet will take advantage of it.\n\n**Conjecture and FUD warnings:**\n\nPosts stating an algorithm is in control imply that humans are no longer in control. I see a few issues with this assumption\n\n1- humans aren't in control, therefore we can't rely on human solutions:\n\nSuggesting the 'algorithm is in control' is like a driver saying 'the car is in control.' This can be potentially problematic, as bad faith actors can push the argument of 'the algorithm won't let it,' or 'no one is in control.' This is factually incorrect. We know flesh and blood humans are dictating any algorithmic changes. We also know, despite any algorithm, who is in control. Apes are in control. Despite whatever arguments about who will let what happen, remember the DD. There is only one lock. There is only one key. Apes hold that key. \n\n2- The Algorithm made me do it:\n\nPeople created this scenario, not an algorithm. Ken G, Steve C, and the rest of the fuckeroos are the ones who made the decisions. They have ultimate culpability and saying 'tHe AlGoRiThM!1!' removes the criminal responsibility these people personally own. Speaking for myself, I'd rather keep pointing a damning finger at the people who intentionally led the trolley car into a canyon, rather than blaming the tracks. \n\n3- There is NOT One Algorithm:\n\nWhy are suggestions from Netflix and google different when deciding what to watch? They use different algorithms. All the various institutions at play likely have their own proprietary software and their own finely tuned algorithms. These may work is concert or opposition to a competitor's algorithm. The efficacy of any single algorithm is directly tested by a competitor's, and it's an insanity game trying to guess who's is at work and when and whether they've been changed.\n\n4- It doesn't matter\n\nWhether or not there IS an algorithm, that doesn't change Ape strategy: Buy if you can, Hold if you can't. Any specific changes to an algorithm won't affect that. Once the price starts going up, all algorithms will be useless due to necessity of a single process: Buy GME or increase Bid until enough GME is bought to close GME shorts. \n\nEven if enough insight into the specifics of a single algorithm can be definitively exposed, with the number of eyes on this sub, I guarantee those exposed parameters will be altered by the owners ASAP. Endeavoring to reverse engineer an algorithm therefore provides very little insight given our known strategy.\n\n\n\n**Kill 'The Algorithm':**\n\nAs an alternative to speaking about *[The Algorithm]* as some On High GME Gatekeeper chasing us away from the lush grass of Tendietown, consider using this approach to explaining the ideas for DD:\n\n-Pattern\n\nThis would better be used to explain the various cycles that are analyzed and follow a recognizable form. Changing support lines, short term trends because of large or small price changes.\n\t\n-Trend\n\nA trend is the general direction of a price over a period of time. Though there are highs and lows, GME is trending UP\n\t\n-Strategy\n\nA strategy is a plan or policy that is designed to acheive a major or overall aim. For GME, shorts' strategy is to keep the price low\n\t\n-Tactics\n\ntactics are specific actions or steps that are used to implement a strategy. For GME, shorts' tactics are wash sales, married puts, and delusional lunacy.\n\n-\n\nThe most solid DDs are comprised of one of these ideas even if they don't use the exact terms. The terms aren't important, it's more about having a solid approach to what is being discussed and how it is relevant to other conclusions (though some of these are well established enough to not need reiterating, such as the shorts' strategy to tank the price). \n\nExamples, Broadly speaking:\n\n-I've noticed this pattern occurring within this trend. Based on this pattern, I have used supporting data to support, but not prove, a general strategy that is being used. This strategy is possible due to the utilization of these tactics.\n\n-I've taken a set of data and mathematically/statistically analyzed it, and the results correlate with a pattern or trend. The correlation indicates involvement of these elements which weren't previously expected to be involved.  \n\nExamples, Somewhat specifically:\n\n-Over the past 6 months, GME has demonstrated a TREND of higher highs and higher lows. Within this trend, we've noticed a PATTERN of price spikes and falls at work. This pattern supports a theory of, but does not prove, a TACTIC in which FTDs are being reset periodically. These resets coincide with our understanding of shorts' overall STRATEGY of keeping the price low and not closing positions. [Note: I'm using the word 'theory' in a scientific sense. A system of ideas and/or independently provable conclusions are used to create and support a theory. The theory can still be proven incorrect as new information is learned or discovered.] The T+21 theory was based on the previous iterations of the price spike. We hypothesized a spike in price the week of June 9th based on the T+21 theory. When this hypothesis proved false, the T+21 theory was reviewed, and an underlying assumption was struck down (that assumption being that shorts HAD to follow a T+21 pattern). \n\n-Using this known dataset of all stocks, and using the following methodology, this list has a high correlation to the GME trend or GME patterns, suggesting that these stocks are being manipulated as a group. Looking at the list, it's clear that entire ETFs are being manipulated to suppress the price of GME.\n\n-\n\n**TL;DR** - There is no single Algorithm and trying to figure out specifics of one is not worth the time or effort. DDs about an algorithm are often flawed, with little substance or data driven conclusions. As algorithms can be changed, the effort is largely wasted. Any DD about algorithm would be better served by using known alternatives.\n\nEdit1: formatting",
