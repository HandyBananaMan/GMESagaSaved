I have my own also and after reading the DD, it's close to gmefloor.com. I made my own decision and I'm not trying to give financial advice to anyone else. I've done my own research and made up my own mind. This is a once in forever opportunity to change my life and I'm not wasting it. I'm holding until I'm happy. 35 million may sound impossible but with all the fuckery and fake shares, it's possible. If RC and gamestop tweeted what they did, they had to have had confirmation.
