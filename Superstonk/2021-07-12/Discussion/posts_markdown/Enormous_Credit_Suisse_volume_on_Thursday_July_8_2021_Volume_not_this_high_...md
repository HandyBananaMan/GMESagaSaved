# TL:DR: 15 million CS shares were bought in 1 minute. This was probably to stabilise the price and prevent a crash on Thursday. Or somebody is starting to takeover Credit Suisse.

Hi all.

I was just looking over the charts and spotted a major anomaly on the 5 day chart for Credit Suisse: a 15.58 million share buy order. This occurs on July 8th 2021 the Thursday of last week when bank stocks, and everything else went down before the “this is fine” on Friday.

[There it is, the great green crayon](https://preview.redd.it/dfph6v5k0ra71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b4f2abdddbb47b41bdbee3dffe2bf3c0e7fc3d)

To check that this was not a display issue, I viewed the one day of Credit Suisse for Thursday 8th July and again found this same anomalous buy order. I expected that by going from the 5 minute (the 5 day) to 1 minute (1 day) volume display this massive buy order might be distributed across each of the 5 minutes being examined, so that an average buy of 3 million shares per minute for 5 minutes would be shown.

This was not the case.

Rather than diluting, closer examination revealed an even more concentrated buy order: **15,420,000 shares at $9.90 coming in at 10:27 am on July 8th 2021. This is a buy order worth around $152,000,000**

[Buy confirmed on 1 day at 10:27 on July 8th 2021](https://preview.redd.it/3qq1a74m0ra71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd233533b8d101e95e4f4b05d9fea08b23d16c7)

Again investigating that this was not a glitch I checked this against the YTD and found the same.

This confirmed that a major buy did occur at 21.27 million volume for the day compared to an average of 4 million shares on the surrounding days.

The last time volume in Credit Suisse was this high was during the Archegos meltdown

This spike comes during the Thursday price dump across the market, 2 days after the WSJ published [This article on more Credit Suisse staff leaving](https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-credit-suisse-senior-bankers-depart-in-wake-of-archegos-loss-11625587510?mod=hp_lead_pos4), and [4 days before the Compliance Chief of Credit Suisse was reported to have quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oil8aw/smells_like_somethings_burning/)

3 possibilities occur to me on this

1. Shares were purchased to stabilise the price, preventing shares in Credit Suisse from dipping below a critical level during a downturn and triggering wider selloffs and crashing the stock price.
2. Yahoo Finance stats show 10.4 million shares sold short as of June 14th 2021. I haven’t checked the SEC Failure to Deliver data, but perhaps that too would show something in our ballpark to suggest FTD purchases, or covering/rolling forward of options
3. This indicates that Credit Suisse is beginning to get bought out by rival firms to be swallowed up. There has been increasingly open talk about 1 merging CS with UBS, or 2 being bought out by other banks and ceasing to exist. Checking institutional holders of CS through Yahoo Finance again, the largest  3 institutional holder is Dimensional Fund at 4.5 million shares and 0.18%, followed by Allianze Bank at 3.5 mil and 0.14%, and earnest Partners at 3.1 mil and 0.12%. A block purchase of 15 million shares at the bargain price of 9.90 would provide more control than the top 3 institutional holders combined, instantaneously, and if being added to an existing position would quickly produce a dominant holder even though the ownership is nowhere near a majority.
