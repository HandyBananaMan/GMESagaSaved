**Disclaimer: This is not a debate about Gary Gensler. I don't give a shit if he's good or bad. You're all setting yourselves up for FUD and I'm stopping it now before it gets too bad.**

Put yourselves in the shoes of the Hedge Funds. Apes have three main things to confirm before they can confirm the MOASS:

1. The stock is heavily shorted
2. The shorts have not closed out their positions
3. The government isn't going to screw retail and bail out the Hedge Funds

Well guess what, #1 and #2 are solid. 100% solid. Zero fucking doubt. We've done the research on those a million times over and the price movement alone on GME is enough to confirm them. So where does that leave us? Number fucking three.

The ONLY remaining way the hedge funds can get us to paper hand is through the fear of being screwed by the government. While it's a meaningless fear, it's one we haven't discussed nearly enough on this subreddit. While this sub is avoiding the topic, however, Shitadel and co are clearly at work pushing topics straight to the top of this sub.

I'm not going to bother linking or giving attention to the posts, but whenever there's anti-Gary Gensler sentiment it always shows in batches of **3 to 5 posts which shoot straight to the fucking top faster then I can blink**.

&#x200B;

And it's not just bots, it's a mixture of users, shills, and people of all walks of life. **It's an easy and relatable sentiment to hate the SEC**. Hell, they've been corrupt for 84 fucking years, I get it. We all do.

However, what if that sentiment continues to spread? Well, that opens us up to the only remaining avenue of paperhanding.

"I'm getting out, the government's going to screw us."

"The stock's volume disappeared because they're erasing the short positions."

"I knew we couldn't beat the SEC."

"They're doing the same thing they did with Lehman Brothers."

This is the type of FUD you're going to get slapped with if you don't snap out of this sentiment. And it's all worthless FUD because none of it can happen. We have the key. The beast is locked in the cage. Just buy and hold and stop perpetrating this FUD, because the next wave WILL involve the government and they're going to try and scare the hell out of you. And nothing creates more emotion in people than the government, especially right now. Volatile emotions, as you've all experienced, are what they want and the only way they can get to you.

Oh, and there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Gary Gensler such as his net worth or his employment at Goldman Sachs 25 years ago, **but a 2-second clip from Inside Job that provides 0 detail and a handwavy comment from one of Criand's DDs is not one of them** *(Criand your DD is amazing so don't take this personally)*. It's blatantly obvious that very few of you even watched the movie, so stop referencing it until you see the clip.

Finally: Here's the clip. This is required watching for EVERYONE. I've clipped the exact point that he's mentioned:

I don't give a single shit about how you feel about Gensler, but please stop FUDing yourselves. You're setting yourselves up for disaster.
