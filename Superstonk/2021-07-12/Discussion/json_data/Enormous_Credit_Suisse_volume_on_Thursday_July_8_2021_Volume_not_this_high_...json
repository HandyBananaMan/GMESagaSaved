    "selftext": "# TL:DR: 15 million CS shares were bought in 1 minute. This was probably to stabilise the price and prevent a crash on Thursday. Or somebody is starting to takeover Credit Suisse.\n\nHi all.\n\nI was just looking over the charts and spotted a major anomaly on the 5 day chart for Credit Suisse: a 15.58 million share buy order. This occurs on July 8th 2021 the Thursday of last week when bank stocks, and everything else went down before the \u201cthis is fine\u201d on Friday.\n\n[There it is, the great green crayon](https://preview.redd.it/dfph6v5k0ra71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b4f2abdddbb47b41bdbee3dffe2bf3c0e7fc3d)\n\nTo check that this was not a display issue, I viewed the one day of Credit Suisse for Thursday 8th July and again found this same anomalous buy order. I expected that by going from the 5 minute (the 5 day) to 1 minute (1 day) volume display this massive buy order might be distributed across each of the 5 minutes being examined, so that an average buy of 3 million shares per minute for 5 minutes would be shown.\n\nThis was not the case.\n\nRather than diluting, closer examination revealed an even more concentrated buy order: **15,420,000 shares at $9.90 coming in at 10:27 am on July 8th 2021. This is a buy order worth around $152,000,000**\n\n[Buy confirmed on 1 day at 10:27 on July 8th 2021](https://preview.redd.it/3qq1a74m0ra71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd233533b8d101e95e4f4b05d9fea08b23d16c7)\n\nAgain investigating that this was not a glitch I checked this against the YTD and found the same.\n\nThis confirmed that a major buy did occur at 21.27 million volume for the day compared to an average of 4 million shares on the surrounding days.\n\nThe last time volume in Credit Suisse was this high was during the Archegos meltdown\n\n[Enormous spike in volume confirmed on YTD chart, volume last this high during Archegos meltdown. Compare with price drop, volume spike in late March \\/ early April 2021](https://preview.redd.it/c6w7icdo0ra71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe47930d3a008fb8e0d498be862dc7cf8b6cb50)\n\nThis spike comes during the Thursday price dump across the market, 2 days after the WSJ published [This article on more Credit Suisse staff leaving](https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-credit-suisse-senior-bankers-depart-in-wake-of-archegos-loss-11625587510?mod=hp_lead_pos4), and [4 days before the Compliance Chief of Credit Suisse was reported to have quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oil8aw/smells_like_somethings_burning/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 possibilities occur to me on this\n\n1. Shares were purchased to stabilise the price, preventing shares in Credit Suisse from dipping below a critical level during a downturn and triggering wider selloffs and crashing the stock price.\n2. Yahoo Finance stats show 10.4 million shares sold short as of June 14th 2021. I haven\u2019t checked the SEC Failure to Deliver data, but perhaps that too would show something in our ballpark to suggest FTD purchases, or covering/rolling forward of options\n3. This indicates that Credit Suisse is beginning to get bought out by rival firms to be swallowed up. There has been increasingly open talk about 1 merging CS with UBS, or 2 being bought out by other banks and ceasing to exist. Checking institutional holders of CS through Yahoo Finance again, the largest  3 institutional holder is Dimensional Fund at 4.5 million shares and 0.18%, followed by Allianze Bank at 3.5 mil and 0.14%, and earnest Partners at 3.1 mil and 0.12%. A block purchase of 15 million shares at the bargain price of 9.90 would provide more control than the top 3 institutional holders combined, instantaneously, and if being added to an existing position would quickly produce a dominant holder even though the ownership is nowhere near a majority.\n\nEdit 1: [Additionally the new COO of Credit Suisse Asset Management is coming from UBS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-names-asset-management-072346235.html)",
