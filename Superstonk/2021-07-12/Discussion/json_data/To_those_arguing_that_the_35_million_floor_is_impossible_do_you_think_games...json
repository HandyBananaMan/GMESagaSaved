I've done my own research and made up my own mind. This is a once in forever opportunity to change my life and I'm not wasting it. I'm holding until I'm happy. 35 million may sound impossible but with all the fuckery and fake shares, it's possible. If RC and gamestop tweeted what they did, they had to have had confirmation.",
