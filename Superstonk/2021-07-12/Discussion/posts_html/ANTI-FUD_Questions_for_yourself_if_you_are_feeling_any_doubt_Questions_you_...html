<p>When the buy button was shut off by brokers in January, if SHFs were covering their short positions why did the price drop rather than continuing to increase? We know they had to buy the entire float of shares back and then some, past squeezes tell us no one can do this would be impossible to do in one day.</p>
<p>If they covered in January, why did they run ads on CNBC saying Melvin covered their shorts? They don't gain anything doing that so why would they?</p>
<p>Why hasn't Citadel acted like a normal company since? For example, they used to post to platforms like Twitter regularly and they are now working through the night 7 days a week.</p>
<p>Why did we run up in price afterward from $40 to nearly $350 over a couple of days when everyone thought this was already over?</p>
<p>Why did we run-up from 240 to 340 then back down to 170 on no news on March 10th all before 1pm?</p>
<p>Why are SHFs still reporting massive and fluctuating losses related to the GME share price?</p>
<p>If the votes were accurate, why was there an anomaly in gamestops 8-K filing?</p>
<p>For everyone the total is: 55,541,279</p>
<p>Except for Larry Cheng where the total is: 55,541,280</p>
<p>Why did we see price swings up $30 then immediately back down $30 on no news within less than 10 minutes, while at the exact same time other "meme stocks" (I do not consider GME a meme stock obviously but this is the terminology easily used) did the same exact thing?</p>
<p>Why has GME charted exactly the same way as some other "meme stocks" (I do not consider GME a meme stock obviously but this is the terminology easily used)?</p>
<p>Why was the volume so low on June 9th? The lowest in a year, when gamestop issued 8.5million more shares tradable since. Should we not have higher volume as there are more available to trade?</p>
<p>Reported on iborrowdesk, SHFs used to have access to shorting millions of stock at a time back in January and February, there is now only 150,000 reported and the number has been shrinking. Shouldn't this be much higher after the 8.5m offering?</p>
<p>Why does good news from gamestop always send the price stock down?</p>
<p>Why isn't the buy massive pressure from retail causing the stock price to rise?</p>
<p>Why did the NYSE president say this?</p>
<p>"In some of the meme stocks that we've seen, or stocks that have a high level of retail participation, the vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic," said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) NYSE. That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is,"</p>
<p>Why have there been so many regulations put into place not only to curb what tools SHFs have to conceal FTDs but also contingency rules in the event of insolvency by large players?</p>
<p>In reference to a massive margin breach in Q1 the DTCC said this:</p>
<p>"The largest deficiency incurred during the quarter was mainly driven by a single security exhibiting idiosyncratic risk"</p>
<p>They have just stated here essentially, that one stock has caused the most Margin breaches in Q1, 3x the previous record. This is exactly what would be expected if the DD is correct on GME. Why do you think they would report this if we are incorrect with the DD?</p>
<p>We know Robinhood got margin called in January and that they "raised funds" to meet their margin requirements. The DTCC confirmed in their senate hearing that shutting off the buy button was not part of their discussion with Robinhood and that it was a decision made by Robinhood themselves. Therefore we have a timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Price runs up over $400</li>
<li>DTCC tells Robinhood et al, they have to meet margin requirements.</li>
<li>Melvin capital and Robinhood both meet margin requirements, due to an influx of cash from bigger HFs.</li>
<li>Robinhood shuts off the buy button the very next day to prevent a rise in price any further, thus not allowing margin calls to be triggered once more when the price rose higher.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is your reason for why they shut the buy button off if they closed their position? It shouldn't have mattered for them or anyone else as the margin requirements were met and they should have used that cash to close out their position.</p>
<p>What happened to the FTDs? Before the January run-up we have millions of FTDs sometimes multiple days in a row. I am told by shills this is normal... If this is normal, where did they all go since we have had the largest trading volume on the stock since all these FTDs? Shouldn't there be many many more? How is this not evidence they are concealing them in options like we know they can as confirmed by industry experts? Did they just magically get 1,000,000 times better at delivering shares during the highest volume period on the stock ever in it's history? <em>charts below.</em></p>

<p>Big one for the shills:</p>
<p>Without lying to yourself, how is it you reasonably believe SHFs closed an over 230%+ SI in one day - during the same time that the largest globally-spanning-retail-rally of a stock in history, on top of a massive Gamma squeeze - without sending the price rocketing into the thousands, despite evidence of previously squeezed stocks with far, far less SI taking multiple days at much much higher peak prices?</p>
<p>Additional question:</p>
<p>There was a total volume of <strong>1,115,376,000</strong> during just the ten days preceding January 28th - the day Robinhood turned off buying. How the actual fuck is that possible if the available float at the time was around 26.7 million?</p>
