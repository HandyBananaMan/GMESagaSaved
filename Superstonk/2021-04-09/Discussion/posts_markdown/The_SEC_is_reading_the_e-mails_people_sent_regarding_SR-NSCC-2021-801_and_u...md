# IF YOU E-MAILED THE SEC AND ARE WORRIED, EVERYTHING IS OKAY!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Edit:  TL;DR: Many apes e-mailed yesterday to SEC after reading a post about commenting on the rule immediately, because they did it for the greater good and they care about the people. Unfortunately, apes are worried if they were manipulated in doing so that could possibly affect the implementation of the rule and paint retail investors in a bad way. The answer is EVERYTHING IS FINE IF YOU DID THIS, from my reasonable belief.**

&#x200B;

I wanted to make this post for visibility and hopefully give some assurance to some of the apes that e-mailed the SEC and are worried about possibly delaying the rule because of what they did. **It is alright, and here is why:**

**This was the letter template that many apes used to send the e-mail:**

I am an individual retail investor and would like to express my opinion regarding this new proposed rule SR-NSCC-2021-801.

I believe this rule - if enacted- is a step in the right direction towards accountability for those who engage in the short selling/stock borrowing program. It is time for an update to the current RegSHO closeout requirements and I believe that this SLD change in process from Monthly to Daily settlement is progress.

I would like to see this rule passed and implemented immediately.

Lastly on this ruling, I would like to see stronger penalties enacted for non compliance and violation of this rule.

Thank you for your time & consideration in this matter.

People mentioned that flooding the SEC with these e-mails all of a sudden (since this was an event yesterday) could possibly delay the rule being put in place because they are required to read ALL these e-mails (a conservative number would be easily 10,000+ e-mails with the amount of apes there are), **but the SEC made it easier for themselves to read these:**

Oh word, so they're saying **if there's a lot of e-mails that are identical, they take the first OG copy, and then just add up how many e-mails that were identical to that**.

QUESTION: So how many did they receive of these e-mails (the letter template mentioned above?)

&#x200B;

ANSWER: **Over 9000.**

![Hey! That's the letter!](https://preview.redd.it/tocdm8m2g7s61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=e44ffcb765b479f1d72d056728d27e6a28aff439)

The SEC (so far) has read, and publicly stated that they have counted **9,332 of these letters.**

Earlier in the morning, I remember visiting the website and not seeing these letter types on their website before. What that means is; either I was blind as hell and just missed it point-blank, or that they updated it during the day. Is this the final count or is it still updating? I don't know. I'm just a dumb ape :/

**Conclusion: I believe everything should be okay. Don't take my word for it. Do your own DD and research. I did mine up top and shared it with y'all. This is not any type of advice.**
