    "selftext": "Hi ape detectives! Today me (Watson) and our resident Sherlock u/Jerrynka69 bring you a solution to the most recent DFV tweet ( [UNO Kitty DFV Tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1380611475757236226/photo/1) ), cryptically sending us a message like only he, The One Who Is Not a Cat can.\n\n1. Firstly, we'll pay attention to highlighted cards which have been edited in. There's 2 decks, one on the left side in hand and one on the right side, probably a discard pile.\n2. Check the left hand UNO deck. You can see 2,1,wild,6,4. A reverse has been played so read it in reverse and sub the wild for 1 (Wild is highlighted, in the original photo Ace is highlighted and Ace = 1, thanks u/hnddt1) - **4 / 16 / 21.** A date we all know very well - his options are expiring and some other DDs have been pointing to it!\n3. On the right side we see **WILD** highlighted, we can see reverse and some other numbers. ~~We've been unable to crack the other numbers but as they're not highlighted we assume they have been used just to cover the original card art.~~\n\nEDIT: Thanks you u/Thilanii we got this juicy piece of info: \"*You\u2019ve got 2 2 and 4 on the right side with the wild card. What happened on 2/24? We opened at 44.70, ended at 91.71, and after hours we peaked 200 a few times. Coincidence? Nope.* \"\n\nMany other detective apes pointed out that the **right hand numbers could be also read as 4/22** \\- so that\u2019s probably a possible date (I know we don\u2019t do dates here, I\u2019m just reporting the finds) to look forward to!\n\n4. Check the lamp above kitties heads very very closely. You'll see **5 GME logos** there! Do you know how many trading days are left until 4 / 16 / 21? **5.**([Check this GIF](https://imgur.com/a/7IxdbKw) from u/vivvienne if you can't see the logos!) 5. How many kitties do we have playing? **5.**\n\nWhat does this tell us?\n\nIn our opinion (GME bulls Discord investigators) it **means that 4 / 16 / 21 is gonna be WILD**. His options are expiring and with the right side numbers he's point at the last time we saw a very nice price hike after a dip!\n\nAlso, there is a possibility DFV has planned for this date, check out this DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme\\_target\\_dates\\_jan\\_15\\_april\\_16\\_not\\_march\\_19/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=mweb](https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb)\n\nThere is 5 GME logos on the lamp and 5 kitties playing, which means 5 trading days left until that date.\n\nNotice fat cash stacks on table, very thematic too! We\u2019re playing for big cash indeed - plus the kitty playing is **ALL IN!** (thanks u/Same-Tour9465)\n\nAlso, this just in: GME Youtube just uploaded a video with 5 nights at Freddy's. The title?\n\n**DECODED** | **FIVE** NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S SPRING COLORWAY PLUSHIES.\n\nTits? Jacked.\n\nTendies? In the fryer.\n\nHands? Fucking diamond.\n\nAll-seeing award from anonymous source? Incoming. (Don't be stingy on me u/deepfuckingvalue !)\n\nIf anybody has more clues, let us know!\n\n\u2014\n\nNew clue by u/Financial-Process-86 : WAIT. A. SECOND.\n\nFive nights at freddies is a game where you are constantly scared by FAKE ANIMALS, (animatronic machines) until you get to the fifth night. At which point YOU WIN.\n\nThe stock market is described as a zoo (ostrich, bulls, bears, sheep, pigs).\n\nYou have to be able to shine the light on the fake animals in order for the animals to not consume you.\n\nSEE ANY PARALLELS?\n\nI'M NOT CRAZY RIGHT?\n\n\u2014\n\nNew clue by u/baimeigui102460:\n\nPOSSIBLE NEW CLUE:\n\nDid you apes notice the photo DFV posted is squeezed a bit when compared to the original?\n\nHere is an original/unaltered version of the image:\n\n[http://gastrotekadanontzat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gastroteka-Danontzat-Hondarribia-La-trastienda.jpg](http://gastrotekadanontzat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gastroteka-Danontzat-Hondarribia-La-trastienda.jpg)\n\nOpen up both images in two browser tabs and flip through them back and forth to see the effect. You'll see a squozening happening. He could have chosen any version of the image as a base to edit. Can't help but notice this.\n\nThoughts? u/pepsodont\n\n\u2014\n\nEDIT: Just to make one thing clear - we don't think he's pointing to a squeeze date, nobody knows when that'll be. He's sending a message that he thinks something positively important / interesting will happen on that date. Might be just his options expiring. Might be a price hike. Who knows? Let's wait and see.\n\nEDIT 2: For those who didn't know - DFV has been tweeting decreasing numbers in his cryptic tweets, like a countdown. This could be number 5 in sequence.\n\nEDIT 3: RIP my inbox\n\nEDIT 4: I don\u2019t want to cause positive panic at the disco, but I have a feeling DFV\u2019s awarder karma jumped substantially recently - it\u2019s up to 1 131 384 \ud83d\ude33\n\nEDIT 5: New clues by other detective apes added! Keep \u2018em coming!\n\nEDIT 6: Looks like there is possibility of DFV knowing about 21/4/16 for SURE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme\\_target\\_dates\\_jan\\_15\\_april\\_16\\_not\\_march\\_19/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=mweb](https://www.reddit.com/r/trollwallstreet/comments/m0ndyr/gme_target_dates_jan_15_april_16_not_march_19/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb)",
