PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

YOU'RE NOT VOTING, AS MULTIPLE POSTS HAVE IMPLIED.

IT ONLY COMMENTS TO THE SEC.

IMO, it's not worth jamming up the SEC with comments, if you're hoping for a quick resolution...

We all  have opinions, but unless you have a legal pov it's just more for the reviewers to dig through.

&#x200B;

YOU'RE POTENTIALLY SLOWING DOWN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, WITH LITTLE TO NO UPSIDE.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**  
People have been commenting that you should be allowed to **express your opinions.** 

**I 100% agree.** However-

You're not expressing your thoughts when you **literally copy/paste someone else's email**. Especially if you haven't thought it out enough to realize **it's a comment not a "vote" as implied**, nor realized that **the due date was incorrectly posted** and posted a **day after it was due.**

If you have something **material**, by all means **express it**.

Otherwise, you're **burdening** an otherwise poorly staffed **system** and **slowing down the process.**

You either want it passed quickly or you don't...
