<p>PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.</p>
<p>YOU'RE NOT VOTING, AS MULTIPLE POSTS HAVE IMPLIED.</p>
<p>IT ONLY COMMENTS TO THE SEC.</p>
<p>IMO, it's not worth jamming up the SEC with comments, if you're hoping for a quick resolution...</p>
<p>We all  have opinions, but unless you have a legal pov it's just more for the reviewers to dig through.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>YOU'RE POTENTIALLY SLOWING DOWN THE APPROVAL PROCESS, WITH LITTLE TO NO UPSIDE.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br />
People have been commenting that you should be allowed to <strong>express your opinions.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I 100% agree.</strong> However-</p>
<p>You're not expressing your thoughts when you <strong>literally copy/paste someone else's email</strong>. Especially if you haven't thought it out enough to realize <strong>it's a comment not a "vote" as implied</strong>, nor realized that <strong>the due date was incorrectly posted</strong> and posted a <strong>day after it was due.</strong></p>
<p>If you have something <strong>material</strong>, by all means <strong>express it</strong>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you're <strong>burdening</strong> an otherwise poorly staffed <strong>system</strong> and <strong>slowing down the process.</strong></p>
<p>You either want it passed quickly or you don't...</p>
