    "selftext": "I've seen lots of apes talking about this subject and mentioning an insurance policy, so I want to clear a few things up.\n\nWe all know that when MOASS happens, all shorts will be forced to close their positions. This means that shares that were sold short must be bought back from the apes holding them. This will bankrupt a lot of firms. If the hedge funds that have shorted GME go bankrupt, the responsibility for closing these positions will be passed up a step along a staircase of companies, which looks something like this:\n\n1. Hedge funds\n2. Prime brokers\n3. Market makers (Shitadel)\n4. The DTCC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Staircase](https://preview.redd.it/mvrr1m6tmdc71.jpg?width=1438&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66547195a946c159e76a302ffc41b2c0b82536bc)\n\nWhen the 1s go bankrupt, the 2s take over closing out the shorts. When they're gone, the 3s takes over from them. And finally when they're broke, the DTCC will be required to take over.\n\nThe DTCC are a bit like the central bank of the US stock market. They are running the show, and if you want to sit and play at the big boy table, you have to join their club and become a \"Participant\". This means all the hedge funds, banks etc. are DTCC Participants. To become a Participant you have to put down a very, very big deposit with the DTCC.\n\nThe DTCC keeps all of these **'pledged assets'** in a big pool as collateral. If one of their members goes bankrupt and owes people money the DTCC sometimes has to pay the costs. It is a kind of emergency fund in case anyone fucks up so badly that the DTCC might be required to pay for their mistakes. Sound familiar?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rj65iobgndc71.jpg?width=1340&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07ee250af453007ae28b248860b869b86b9f860f\n\nThis pool has been referred to as an insurance policy in the past, because this is a quick and easy way of explaining how all of this works. But **there is no insurance policy on the planet that could cover the potential losses the DTCC could face here.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe largest insurer in the world, Allianz, has 'only' \\~$1.4t of assets. I work in insurance and I'm confident that the *entire global insurance industry combined could not pay for the MOASS.*\n\nThe terminology we use when talking about the source of funds for MOASS is important, especially as the conversation has recently started spreading to places like LinkedIn. Referring to insurance could be a source of FUD as people will chime in noting the limitations of insurance companies' assets, the liklihood that they will actually pay out etc.\n\nAnother noteworthy point is that the deposits can be made up of a variety of different assets such as stocks and bonds, all of which will have varying values as their market prices fluctuate. It is this pool of assets that the DTCC will have to dip into to get funds to pay apes. But our DD shows that either immediately before or immediately after the MOASS begins (depending on what triggers it) we will see a huge market crash around the globe, on an unprecedented scale.\n\nThis means that the value of the assets in this pool is likely to deteriorate significantly. We have had a few different estimates given (for which I can't find a reliable source) saying that the DTCC should have somewhere between $60-75t in the pool at the moment.\n\nSo let's do some napkin maths for a second. Let's pretend there are currently 300m GME shares out there. Let's pretend also that the DTCC's pool is devalued by 50% and is now worth only $35t. We'll add another $1t that is paid by the assholes from steps 1-3 on the staircase.\n\n$36t \u00f7 300m = $120k per share.\n\nNow, the geometric mean DD shows that a lot of people will probably paperhand way below a figure like this, which leaves more funds for diamond handed apes. We have also seen many apes **individually and of their own accord** confirming they will never sell some or all of their shares. I will be taking this approach myself also. This again increases the funds available for those who do sell. **So this means that the figure of $120k per share is definitely not a limitation, I personally expect the price to go into the millions.**\n\nBut it stands to reason that even the DTCC will only get so far through the task of closing these shorts before they run out of funds. What could happen after this is open to speculation and I'm not really going to get into it too much. But just know this - **if the DTCC were allowed to fail, the entire American economy would grind to a halt**. It's simply not going to be allowed to happen.\n\nWhat I personally would expect to happen is a bailout of the DTCC by the US government, and the money needed to do so will be printed on the day. The taxpayer will once again be burdened with the mistakes of wall street scumbags. But with their new wealth, apes can and will effect political change to try and avoid this happening ever again. I'm a dreamer, I know!\n\nAnyway, I'm getting sidetracked. The crucial point I hope people can take away from this post is that there is no insurance policy involved here. There will not be any way that an insurance company could weasel their way out of paying for this because they simply won't be involved.\n\n**I think we should refer to the DTCC's funds as something else e.g. the deposit pool.** I'll let apes figure the name out!\n\n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
