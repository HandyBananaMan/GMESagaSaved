<h1>Title: ðŸš¨ PSA ðŸš¨ Don't forget that there will be small "squeezes" before the real MOASS. These will be set up to fool you into a sell off. You shouldn't take this as an opportunity to day trade.</h1>

<p>Not financial advice.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how it will look. I'm guessing it will go up to the several thousands range before dropping back down for several days/weeks/months. They will do this to try and trigger a mass sell off by creating fear that you will miss the boat. Some people may be tempted to work this play and sell high to buy back in low, but this will delay MOASS even more. Just buy and hold. You won't miss anything. It will be obvious when it's really happening.</p>
<p>Edit: I wanted to add that without a doubt, media news networks will publish stories about the "epic" squeeze that just squoze. We know better.</p>
<p>Edit 2: while this post is meant for everybody, it's aimed at the new people who will be joining the community. You may have seen this 100 times, but with recent revelations on LinkedIn and other outlets, I felt it important to highlight the psychological tactics being used against us.</p>
