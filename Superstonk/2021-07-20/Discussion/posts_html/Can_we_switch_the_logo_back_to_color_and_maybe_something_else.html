<p>I enjoyed the whole banner contest, and then the Lego thing.<br />
I also enjoyed as everything went to gray... but I'd like to see things switch back to color.  </p>
<p>Maybe it is time to switch to an alternate logo/banner as well. The whole crayon cocaine thing has been fun, but I suspect anyone 'new' discovering this sub (and dare say--older) may immediately question their arrival.  </p>
<p>It would be nice to add newer Apes and retail to the cause.   <br />
I think some of the banner contest runner ups should get a shot at the top.</p>
