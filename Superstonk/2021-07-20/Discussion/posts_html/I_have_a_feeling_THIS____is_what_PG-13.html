<p>I hope everyone had a wonderful day today! By no means am I a wrinkled brain, I only see connections that could potentially give the community hype!   </p>
<p>So to begin, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-92213.pdf">NSCC-2021-002</a>, is the rule set that "Automates the Margin Call Process."  How this rule is getting put to use is something called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supplemental-liquidity-provider.asp">Supplemental Liquidity Deposits</a>. (Click for an Investopedia Link.)  </p>
<h1>Current Rules Relating to Supplemental Liquidity Deposits</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Currently, NSCC only collects supplemental liquidity deposits during monthly</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>options expiry periods in order to cover the heightened liquidity exposure resulting from</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>increased trading activity around options expiration.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Proposed Changes to the Rules Relating to Supplemental Liquidity Deposits</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>As discussed above, NSCC may only collect supplemental liquidity deposits  </p>
<p>during monthly options expiry periods under its current Rules.  </p>
<p><strong>However, NSCC can face sudden</strong> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortfall.asp">liquidity shortfalls</a> <strong>on any business day, not just those business days that fall within monthly options expiry periods, particularly during volatile market conditions unrelated to options expiration.</strong>  </p>
<p>To address this issue, NSCC proposes to change the  </p>
<p>frequency at which it may collect supplemental liquidity deposits to each business day,  </p>
<p>based on a daily calculation. This proposed approach to collecting supplemental liquidity  </p>
<p>deposits should allow NSCC to respond quickly to any sudden liquidity shortfalls arising  </p>
<p>from a Providerâ€™s activity, regardless of when those shortfalls occur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add on to that, the Top 30 Providers of the NSCC that qualified from 2016-2020, will be a part of the "new" SLP.  (links up to that liquidity test that recently happened and only tested for finances from October 2020 and before.)  </p>
<p>Now you must be wondering on how this relates to anything in the title, well take a look at this.  </p>

<p>If my speculation is correct, the 30 days for NSCCs holdings started July 20th, which is when MoonJam started. 30 days later . . . is when MoonJam ends. (August 20th)</p>

<h1>The kicker to seal my speculation? The "30 calendar day holding period" is also on Page 13.</h1>
