People do NOT have your best interest in mind regarding your money/future. Don\u2019t respond to texts or calls during the MOASS from people that usually don\u2019t ever try to contact you. Get a new number and leave those people in the past. I know we\u2019ve tried talking people into buying GME, but if they haven\u2019t done it yet and suddenly have a situation where they urgently \u201cneed\u201d money. Just say no. If any of you apes have any links that you could provide that could help one another regarding how to handle sudden large amounts of money it would be appreciated. Stay discrete, stay humble\u2764\ufe0f",
