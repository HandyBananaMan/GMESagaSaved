The whole crayon cocaine thing has been fun, but I suspect anyone 'new' discovering this sub (and dare say--older) may immediately question their arrival.  \n\nIt would be nice to add newer Apes and retail to the cause.     \nI think some of the banner contest runner ups should get a shot at the top.",
