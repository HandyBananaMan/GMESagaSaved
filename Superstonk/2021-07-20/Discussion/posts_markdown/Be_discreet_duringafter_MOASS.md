When it actually starts. Don’t start telling anyone anything about your exit plan. Even your best friend. People do NOT have your best interest in mind regarding your money/future. Don’t respond to texts or calls during the MOASS from people that usually don’t ever try to contact you. Get a new number and leave those people in the past. I know we’ve tried talking people into buying GME, but if they haven’t done it yet and suddenly have a situation where they urgently “need” money. Just say no. If any of you apes have any links that you could provide that could help one another regarding how to handle sudden large amounts of money it would be appreciated. Stay discrete, stay humble❤️
