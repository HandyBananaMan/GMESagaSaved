Anyone other ape confirm what I'm being told? I am talking to a mortgage broker about a home loan and he just told me that this morning (7/19) lending standards suddenly tightened for jumbo loans (> $300-500k, depending on market) and 1) banks will no longer do instant credit rescores (you have to wait 30-45 days for your report to update) and 2) at least half of your down payment must come from your own assets, not a gift.

These are the kind of moves I remember in 2008 when the mortgage market died and there was a credit crunch between banks. They're not trusting borrowers anymore and sort of not trusting each other.

I just want to buy and HODL, and then buy a house all cash with no banks involved. Papa RC, make it so!

Edit: The other thing was that the broker seemed legitimately surprised by the change. The fact it just landed on him without warning struck me as possibly meaning the banks are reacting to other events, like say, oh I don't know, Marge calling? He's sharp and seems very into mortgages, and this caught him off guard.

Edit 2: This is a mortgage broker I'm dealing with, so I should have titled it "Lenders", not "Banks", as they're not one and the same when it comes to mortgages.
