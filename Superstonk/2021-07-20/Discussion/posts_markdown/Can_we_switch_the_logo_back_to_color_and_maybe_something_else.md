I enjoyed the whole banner contest, and then the Lego thing.  
I also enjoyed as everything went to gray... but I'd like to see things switch back to color.  

Maybe it is time to switch to an alternate logo/banner as well. The whole crayon cocaine thing has been fun, but I suspect anyone 'new' discovering this sub (and dare say--older) may immediately question their arrival.  

It would be nice to add newer Apes and retail to the cause.     
I think some of the banner contest runner ups should get a shot at the top.
