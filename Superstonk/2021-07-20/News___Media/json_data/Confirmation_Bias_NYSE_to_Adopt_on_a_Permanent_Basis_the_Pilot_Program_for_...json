    "selftext": "Obligatory: This is not financial advice.\n\nWhen the market crashes due to margin calls and forced liquidation of hedge funds/market makers before/during MOASS, the NYSE has a rule in place for 15-minute trading halts on all market trading as well as ceasing all trading for the day if a \"level 3\" decline of the S&P 500 index is hit. On 7/16/2021, The NYSE filed with the SEC it's proposed rule change to permanently adopt this rule, and I just love the continued timing of all of the rules dealing with market volatility so I like to point it out. That's all this post is about.\n\nDuring the Mother of all Market Crashes, the rapid decline in the S&P 500 index (SPX) from it's previous day's closing price will be used to determine the 3 levels of halts for all trading activity:\n\nLevel 1 halt: 7% decline of SPX between 9:30 AM - 3:25 PM (15 minute halt in trading activity).\n\nLevel 2 halt: 13% decline between 9:30 AM - 3:25 PM (15 minute halt in trading activity)\n\nLevel 3 halt: 20% decline at any point in the day, all trading will cease for the remainder of the day. Here's a snippet, link to the filing is below.\n\n[ New York Stock Exchange Rulemaking \\(sec.gov\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/s2jnvmubggc71.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=7826932a3bb1470b70058bfc39566f19b0eaaf75)\n\n[SR-NYSE-2021-40](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse.htm#SR-NYSE0-2021-40)",
