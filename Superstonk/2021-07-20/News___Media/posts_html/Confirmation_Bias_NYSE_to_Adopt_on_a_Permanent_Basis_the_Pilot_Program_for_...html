<p>Obligatory: This is not financial advice.</p>
<p>When the market crashes due to margin calls and forced liquidation of hedge funds/market makers before/during MOASS, the NYSE has a rule in place for 15-minute trading halts on all market trading as well as ceasing all trading for the day if a "level 3" decline of the S&amp;P 500 index is hit. On 7/16/2021, The NYSE filed with the SEC it's proposed rule change to permanently adopt this rule, and I just love the continued timing of all of the rules dealing with market volatility so I like to point it out. That's all this post is about.</p>
<p>During the Mother of all Market Crashes, the rapid decline in the S&amp;P 500 index (SPX) from it's previous day's closing price will be used to determine the 3 levels of halts for all trading activity:</p>
<p>Level 1 halt: 7% decline of SPX between 9:30 AM - 3:25 PM (15 minute halt in trading activity).</p>
<p>Level 2 halt: 13% decline between 9:30 AM - 3:25 PM (15 minute halt in trading activity)</p>
<p>Level 3 halt: 20% decline at any point in the day, all trading will cease for the remainder of the day. Here's a snippet, link to the filing is below.</p>
