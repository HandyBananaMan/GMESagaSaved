<p>Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes across the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>Did you feel that? Monday felt so <em>different</em> than most days recently, maybe back to May or so. The energy was different, and the community felt like it had shed a great burden. Instead of general "try to remain positive" vibe, there was genuine excitement again. It really is a great time to HODL GME. The Apes own the float, the short hedge funds can't FUD us into selling, and the shorts must be closed. The existing DD is solid, the new DD flows, and Apes with Diamantenhände will be here through the MOASS. We love the stock and there is <em>nothing</em> that will change that.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände yesterday also felt different, again for the better. The challenges of last week took their toll on the community, and the stability and support of this worldwide gathering place helped many Apes come back to focus. Thank you all for helping to restore this community, and thank you for joining us again.</p>
<p>Today is Tuesday, July 20th and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>

<p>FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.18053998. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check <a href="https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie">Lang &amp; Schwarz</a> or <a href="https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099">TradeGate</a></p>
<p>Many among the Diamantenhände community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler, following their sudden disappearance after Memorial Day. I also am worried, as I had tried to make contact many times and never received a direct response. Three weeks ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the curator of the series. I've been serving as host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!</p>
