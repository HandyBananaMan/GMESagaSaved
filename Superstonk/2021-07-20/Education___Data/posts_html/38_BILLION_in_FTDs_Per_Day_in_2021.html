<p>Seriously WTF! </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm">SEC Fail To Deliver Data</a>, if you sum up the FTDs every day and calculate the value of them (# of FTDs for a stock that day x $ of the stock that day), the average dollar value of FTDs each day for 2021 is $3,853,138,714 ($3.853 BILLION).  EVERY DAY.</p>
<p>The lowest was $1.9B on Jan 5 with the highest being <strong>$11.3B</strong> on June 21st.</p>
