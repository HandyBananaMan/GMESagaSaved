    "selftext": "Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes across the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nDid you feel that? Monday felt so *different* than most days recently, maybe back to May or so. The energy was different, and the community felt like it had shed a great burden. Instead of general \"try to remain positive\" vibe, there was genuine excitement again. It really is a great time to HODL GME. The Apes own the float, the short hedge funds can't FUD us into selling, and the shorts must be closed. The existing DD is solid, the new DD flows, and Apes with Diamantenh\u00e4nde will be here through the MOASS. We love the stock and there is *nothing* that will change that.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde yesterday also felt different, again for the better. The challenges of last week took their toll on the community, and the stability and support of this worldwide gathering place helped many Apes come back to focus. Thank you all for helping to restore this community, and thank you for joining us again.\n\nToday is Tuesday, July 20th and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 120 minutes in: **$180.83 / 153,18 \u20ac**  *(volume: 1858)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 115 minutes in: $180.33 / 152,75 \u20ac  *(volume: 1491)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 110 minutes in: $179.25 / 151,84 \u20ac  *(volume: 1220)*\r\n- \u2b1c 105 minutes in: $177.95 / 150,74 \u20ac  *(volume: 1183)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 100 minutes in: $177.95 / 150,74 \u20ac  *(volume: 1168)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 95 minutes in: $177.97 / 150,75 \u20ac  *(volume: 1166)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 90 minutes in: $177.07 / 149,99 \u20ac  *(volume: 1159)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 85 minutes in: $176.56 / 149,56 \u20ac  *(volume: 1067)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 80 minutes in: $177.10 / 150,01 \u20ac  *(volume: 956)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 75 minutes in: $177.08 / 150,00 \u20ac  *(volume: 948)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 70 minutes in: $176.37 / 149,40 \u20ac  *(volume: 948)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 65 minutes in: $175.83 / 148,94 \u20ac  *(volume: 702)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 60 minutes in: $175.86 / 148,96 \u20ac  *(volume: 702)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 55 minutes in: $176.12 / 149,19 \u20ac  *(volume: 695)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 50 minutes in: $174.68 / 147,96 \u20ac  *(volume: 577)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 45 minutes in: $174.66 / 147,95 \u20ac  *(volume: 562)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 40 minutes in: $174.88 / 148,14 \u20ac  *(volume: 562)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 35 minutes in: $174.68 / 147,96 \u20ac  *(volume: 561)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 30 minutes in: $174.76 / 148,04 \u20ac  *(volume: 514)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 25 minutes in: $174.69 / 147,97 \u20ac  *(volume: 480)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 20 minutes in: $174.62 / 147,91 \u20ac  *(volume: 480)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 15 minutes in: $174.66 / 147,95 \u20ac  *(volume: 477)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 10 minutes in: $174.19 / 147,55 \u20ac  *(volume: 151)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 5 minutes in: $174.26 / 147,61 \u20ac  *(volume: 146)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $173.64 / 147,09 \u20ac  *(volume: 137)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 US close price: $173.49 / 146,96 \u20ac   *($173.09 / 146,62 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18053998. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)\n\nMany among the Diamantenh\u00e4nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler, following their sudden disappearance after Memorial Day. I also am worried, as I had tried to make contact many times and never received a direct response. Three weeks ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the curator of the series. I've been serving as host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
