Seriously WTF! 

According to the [SEC Fail To Deliver Data](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), if you sum up the FTDs every day and calculate the value of them (# of FTDs for a stock that day x $ of the stock that day), the average dollar value of FTDs each day for 2021 is $3,853,138,714 ($3.853 BILLION).  EVERY DAY.

The lowest was $1.9B on Jan 5 with the highest being **$11.3B** on June 21st.
