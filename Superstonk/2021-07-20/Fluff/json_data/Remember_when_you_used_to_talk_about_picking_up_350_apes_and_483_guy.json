The shorts have lost their bet and the losses are infinite. Writhe as they may to avoid impending doom, the game is done and coming to an end.\n\nEnjoy this moment now because, as frustrating as it may be, you will never be here again. Life is about to change. So invite it in, but don\u2019t forget what brought you here. Sure you might have a \u201cbetter\u201d tomorrow, but it\u2019s all relative and today, this moment right in front of you is yours to enjoy. Here. Now.",
