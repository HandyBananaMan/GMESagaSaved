Sigh, the good ole days.

The sub has changed. The majority of us our zen — maybe with a layer of frustration that’s been bubbling since the start. The shorts have lost their bet and the losses are infinite. Writhe as they may to avoid impending doom, the game is done and coming to an end.

Enjoy this moment now because, as frustrating as it may be, you will never be here again. Life is about to change. So invite it in, but don’t forget what brought you here. Sure you might have a “better” tomorrow, but it’s all relative and today, this moment right in front of you is yours to enjoy. Here. Now.
