# A New Eden

Hi. u/alieniity here. Take a seat. I have something crucial to show you.

TL;DR: I found evidence that Gamestop is going to use a blockchain technology titled EdenChain, which is *specifically designed* to convert "real assets" into "non-fungible tokens." Sound familiar? It should. I then speculate further using that evidence on what Gamestop may be doing right now. Spoiler alert; Amazon is history.

***Edit 1:*** *I decided to remove the speculation regarding dates on the post since it's pretty clear we all agree there's too much tinfoil floating around. Gonna keep this strictly about Edenchain.*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here's the deal. If this information I'm going to show you is what *I'm INTERPRETING* it to be, it is potentially large enough to instantly start the MOASS if it made it to public media. It is insider-trading level of huge. If there was no MOASS to begin with, this information would have sent GameStop to the moon anyway. You want to know why Keith Gill invested, then doubled down so many months ago? One word:

Edenchain.

What on earth is Edenchain? *I'm so glad you asked.*

I didn't know what Edenchain was either 24 hours ago, and now my blood is boiling. So I'll just take you on the journey I went on.

Remember [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com)? I had a thought about something yesterday. I thought to myself: *what is GameStop actually* ***DOING?*** I'm fed up with the TA, I want to know what GameStop is actually going to ***DO.***

So I looked for similar domain names to [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com). You can do this by doing a subdomain lookup, I used both [spyse.com](https://spyse.com) and [subdomainfinder.com](https://subdomainfinder.com). Here's what I came across...

![eden.gamestop.com? Wut doin...?](https://preview.redd.it/izez4xv55dc71.jpg?width=1914&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07c0104cbe0363d529760048f4713f11f07bd802)

There is a strange URL I've never heard of before. It's [eden.gamestop.com](https://eden.gamestop.com). Curious, I clicked on it, and nothing happened, the page just kept buffering.

So what did I find? I wasn't sure, but notice the IP as well. Looks like there's one other address with the same IP:

Okay so there's [eden.gamestop.com](https://eden.gamestop.com) and [kiosk.gamestop.com](https://kiosk.gamestop.com) and neither of them work. Okay, who cares?

I certainly do.

I did a quick google search for "eden crypto" and lo and behold...

What is [**Edenchain.io**](https://Edenchain.io)**?**

![Wow. That sure would be useful for GameStop.](https://preview.redd.it/w7ancq2k5dc71.jpg?width=1450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51482ffe519b6474bd651dc793737708cf4c9b20)

Here's something else you should know: *I have no idea how the hell crypto works.* I get the basics, but signing contracts and hashes confuse me. But I can tell you one thing, this is *exactly* what we've hoped GameStop would do, and now they're doing it.

One other important thing to keep in mind, this *does NOT* include or take into account ***Edencoin.*** It probably is something produced on the Eden chain, but the price of that coin is somewhere around $0.0015. Also, I don't see any evidence of Gamestop transferring any of that coin into their public wallet that we see on [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com). Like I said, *I have no idea how crypto actually WORKS, but I'm ASSUMING we can use ETHEREUM on the Edenchain for transactions.* My smooth brain assumption is just "big spooky Edenchain technology make GameStop go to andromeda and amazon go poof."  If anything, do more research on Edenchain and expect it to come up in the future.
