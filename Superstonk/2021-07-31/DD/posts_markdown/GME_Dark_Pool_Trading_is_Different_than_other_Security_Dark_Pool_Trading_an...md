Hi Apes, this is my first "DD" so go easy on me but feel free to correct anything that needs it.

A few days ago I started posting updates on "Dark Pool" trades (Alternative Trading Systems, or ATS) and had a lot of feedback that I was sharing information that was misleading and that GME dark pool percentages were no different than any other security. This may be true as far as percentages but take a look at these charts comparing GME's Dark Pool Indicator to other securities Dark Pool Indicator, or DPI's.

When DPI is higher than usual, that means there was more buying than usual in dark pools.

![When DPI is higher than usual, that means there was more buying than usual in dark pools.](https://preview.redd.it/dxgh1l0lqse71.jpg?width=1707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcbc12b94995087a820f23509778bf8b0e2188f8)

Now, lets take a look at GME's Dark Pool Indicator vs Other securities.

![GAMESTOP - The Dark Pool Indicator is the solid blue trend line](https://preview.redd.it/x39jaw3wsse71.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b98863d889724a7dc41e6fbefb21e9e1c7df426)

Notice how GME's DPI (64% DPI, higher than any other security) was very consistent prior to Januarys run up. Now look at the change that's taken place since. You don't see those large movements up and down. It doesn't fluctuate as it use to. If my research is correct this means that there is a lot more buying than selling going on in the Dark Pools. This would make sense if shares are being bought in the Dark and sold on the lit exchanges which would drive the price down causing the artificial value of GME. Also, check out the light orange color at the bottom of the chart between the volume and DPI. Thats the SI on GME. Someone tell me how the SI on GME has been between 20M-80M shares for 1-2 years or more but then suddenly apes figure out they have the SHF's up against a wall and BAM....drops like the Time Square Ball on New Years Eve . I don't think so Kenny!!!

Now lets look at the same chart with the same dates for Apple.

![APPLE - The Dark Pool Indicator is the solid blue trend line](https://preview.redd.it/wbizrfbysse71.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=84e36cd768623c3ab69acf6968010e16768b395a)

Although the price of Apple has moved up significantly the DPI has not. Because no one cares to drive the price of Apple down. Interesting huh?

And Amazon....

![AMAZON - The Dark Pool Indicator is the solid blue trend line](https://preview.redd.it/6d448m9tsse71.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=247ab5a8da12dfc11db6586348bafc653731b0a1)

Although the price of Amazon has moved up significantly the DPI has not.

And Disney...

![DISNEY - The Dark Pool Indicator is the solid blue trend line](https://preview.redd.it/lw9humhjtse71.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed136a1c4ffe1fef246482d212c399217e1d246)

Although the price of Disney has moved up significantly the DPI has not.

And Microsoft...

![MICROSOFT - The Dark Pool Indicator is the solid blue trend line](https://preview.redd.it/68zr2ktttse71.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e1311d7713fba6cb018a48daae17689040997b0)

And the last one, Facebook...

![FACEBOOK - The Dark Pool Indicator is the solid blue trend line](https://preview.redd.it/nv630wm1use71.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dc0d3fc7175d46a44184f7789cea16d246c11a4)

The DPI caught my eye and is very interesting. I believe the GME Dark Pool Trading is very different than any other stock in the market. They all know what they are up against and will do anything at this point to keep it from happening. This is confirmation enough for me to HODL until the lights cut off. And now I know the percentage of Dark Pool shares in the volume isn't really what matters.

***IT GETS BETTER. SOMETHING ELSE I FOUND WHILE SNOOPING AROUND..***

Dark Pool, or ATS, volume is shown in the volume of each security during trading hours. We just do not get to see the details of the trades. But I was looking through the FINRA OTC (Non-ATS) data that was reported for GME from December 2020 and May 2021. What I found is ridiculous.

**Citadel, and all the other OTC exchanges, traded OVER 1.27 BILLION shares of GME between Dec 2020 and May 2021. And these share DO NOT reflect in the volume the public can see!!!!**

Lets narrow it down to Citadel. *Keep in mind there are ONLY around* ***75,000,000 tradable shares of GME*** *in existence.* This includes institutional ownership and what the apes HODL.

For the week of January 19th-22nd the total volume of GME shares traded on lit exchanges (the volume the public can see) was 357,394,137 million shares. Of those shares 29,392,454 million shares were traded in the Dark Pools. Now get this...OTC GME volume for the same week...170,039,730 shares. This volume does not show in the daily volume. **Citadel's OTC Volume - 80,131,562**

These are just a few weeks out of the year. I understand that the volume comes from high frequency trading and that its buys and sells, **but seriously**....this is an insane amount of GME being traded. I wanted to post FINRA data from other securities and show you how the OTC trades on Apple, Tesla, FB, MSFT, WMT, and others do not compare to the amount seen in GME but it would have made this way too long. Go check it out for yourself. Its incredible. Ill post the link at the end. ***READ EDIT 2 BELOW!***

**TL;DR: The Dark Pool trading in GME seems to be way more buys than sells. Appears the sell are happening in the lit exchanges as everyone predicted. Over 1.2 Billion shares of GME were traded in Over-the-counter exchanges between December 2020 and May 2021. The 1.2 Billion doesn't include Dark Pools or Lit exchanges. Other securities such as Apple, Tesla, and FB do not come close to the statistics of OTC percentage of shares traded vs tradable shares seen in GME. There is no way the SHF's covered. This is mind boggling for me. HODL because we like the stock a lot. Moon coming.**

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards and positive comments. Being my first DD I just knew I was about to get hammered by the wrinkles. I was prepared. Hopefully, the Real Wrinkled Brains can chime in soon if they see it.

***EDIT 2: I forgot to mention that Citadel Connect is a Dark Pool that doesn’t report to FINRA, as mentioned in this subgroup before. “Numerous reliable reports suggest*** [***Citadel Connect***](https://tokenist.com/in-depth-citadel-connect-and-dark-pools-uncovered/) ***is indeed a dark pool. Interestingly enough however, Citadel Connect is not registered as an ATS, nor does it report its trading volume to FINRA, which is overseen by the SEC, per a 2015 Reuters report”. Think about that for a minute. Citadel trades securities OTC, as an (unregistered) ATS, and executes approximately 47% of all U.S.-listed*** [***retail volume***](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/products/equities-and-options/)***. INSANE! Imagine what they are hiding that we will never know about in this “free and fair” market of ours. What they are not reporting is key for SEC to find out IMO.***
