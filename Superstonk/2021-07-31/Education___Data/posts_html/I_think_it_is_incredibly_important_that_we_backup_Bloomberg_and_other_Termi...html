<p>At this point I feel it's absolutely vital we find an Ape with sufficient coding experience and another with access to Bloomberg (+all these other data/analytics paid services) to implement a script that scrapes then logs all of the options data say every couple minutes so that we never miss one of these potential "glitches" as they come and go.    </p>
<p>Not only will this help us direct our attention and potentially give more insight into shorts' strategies, but I can guarantee having this information saved and public will genuinely help speed along any future investigations when Bloomberg either <em>has trouble locating all previous data from this long ago</em> or fights against making it available to the relevant agencies.</p>
<p>If you can offer either of these things, please comment down below. Edit: or PM to remain anonymous</p>
