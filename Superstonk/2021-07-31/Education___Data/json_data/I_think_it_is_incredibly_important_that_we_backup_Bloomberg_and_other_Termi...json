    "selftext": "At this point I feel it's absolutely vital we find an Ape with sufficient coding experience and another with access to Bloomberg (+all these other data/analytics paid services) to implement a script that scrapes then logs all of the options data say every couple minutes so that we never miss one of these potential \"glitches\" as they come and go.    \n    \nNot only will this help us direct our attention and potentially give more insight into shorts' strategies, but I can guarantee having this information saved and public will genuinely help speed along any future investigations when Bloomberg either *has trouble locating all previous data from this long ago* or fights against making it available to the relevant agencies.\n\nIf you can offer either of these things, please comment down below.
