    "selftext": "Just think of what kind of agenda is pushed towards people who haven't invested before.\n\nStatistics like \"80% of traders lose their money\".\n\nOr the media talking about how much money was lost and hardly ever about how much was made.\n\nYou could even say that they were put off when they saw the massive losses made by those on certain subreddits.\n\nIt's not that they don't get it, they're just conditioned to think that they will lose everything and when you're poor, that's a lot of risk to take when every penny matters.\n\nThey never wanted more people to invest. Most people that do lose money are those looking for quick cash that take on huge amounts of risk and cut their losses - then most of the time if they just waited and were patient, they would have turned a profit.\n\nThis is what happens when people don't quite see the bigger picture or don't do their DD.\n\nNow imagine this on a larger scale and that's why people don't invest.\n\nThey need to see results, but by the time they see results, they missed out on the best opportunity that they had to buy some shares and hold. \n\n\"I'm not investing, the price has been going down for a while. I'll lose everything.\"\n\nFear is used to control and to keep us from taking great opportunities. It's really not that complicated to invest into a company, yet it's presented to be overwhelming with complicated terminology and the charts look incredibly complex. But it's really not, it's actually very simple and straightforward if you take maybe 15 mins a day to watch a video explaining a concept to you.\n\nJust know that those who say you're crazy when you tell them about GameStop, there's a lot more to how they came to that conclusion other than being bombarded by the media calling us a cult and dumb money.",
