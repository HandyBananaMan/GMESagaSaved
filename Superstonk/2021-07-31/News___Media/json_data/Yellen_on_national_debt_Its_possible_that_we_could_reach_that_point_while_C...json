These full retards can't even raise their own debt when they have complete control over the situation.  Maybe that's part of the \"plan\" but this outcome is looking like a superstonk prophesy.\n\n\\-Foreclosures begin\n\n\\-Debt ceiling achieved\n\n\\-Rates jump\n\n\\-Stock market gets wild\n\n\\-Shorts have to close\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like the Stonk...\n\nI'm retarded, don't listen to me",
