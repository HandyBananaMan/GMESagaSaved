I find it insane that we are all expected to live within our means, and not default on loans and such.  These full retards can't even raise their own debt when they have complete control over the situation.  Maybe that's part of the "plan" but this outcome is looking like a superstonk prophesy.

\-Foreclosures begin

\-Debt ceiling achieved

\-Rates jump

\-Stock market gets wild

\-Shorts have to close

I like the Stonk...

I'm retarded, don't listen to me
