Hi,

Saw this in another post, so not sure from which document this was found.

Other post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/outsvl/i\_figured\_out\_the\_missing\_puts\_located\_in\_brazil/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/outsvl/i_figured_out_the_missing_puts_located_in_brazil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

This sections right here. 

If this is legit, its basically a free pass on shorting the shit out of the market without any risk of getting margin called.
