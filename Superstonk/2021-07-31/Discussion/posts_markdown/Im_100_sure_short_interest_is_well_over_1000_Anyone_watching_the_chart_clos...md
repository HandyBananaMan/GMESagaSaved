# Title: I’m 100% sure short interest is well over 1000%. Anyone watching the chart closely knows they’ve been shorting hard for six months straight and they never covered back in January. Green candles are followed by red candles of the same size over and over.

And anyone telling you it makes no difference if it’s 220% or 1000% is either a straight up shill or stupider than shit.

Their argument is that as long as apes hold it makes no difference. But with the real number, the over 1000% number, all the apes don’t have to hold for the diamond handers to get the sp to astronomical numbers. 

There can be a bunch of paper handers along the way, which will temporarily lower the price with that increased sell pressure at the psychological price points where msm and shills will go into overdrive making apes think it’s a good time to sell, but it won’t matter one iota for those that hold because when the paper handers are all out of the way si will remain well over 200%.

This saga has become the ultimate narrative war because perception is reality when it comes to when we decide to buy and sell our positions. If the 220% short interest is taken as fact by the majority then when it gets to pretty high numbers and then starts to go down based on paper handers ringing the register, the decision on whether to hold or sell some or all of the position will be tougher than if the over 1000% short interest is taken as fact. So yeah, it matters.

Every indication is that retail from around the world has done nothing but buy nonstop over the last six months. A large percentage of those retail holders already had a big position in January and never sold a share during the sneeze and its aftermath. The total float is only 77 million shares and sp was less than $100 for long stretches of this saga. The chart doesn’t act naturally. Huge red candles appear to intercept the green candles over and over again. That’s not retail. Retail is buying and holding. There’s no way daytraders, with the tiny positions they take, could have that much of an impact against the entire shareholder base holding its position and buying more every day. That only leaves short selling.

It’s over 1000%. It has to be. It’s probably far more than 1000%.
