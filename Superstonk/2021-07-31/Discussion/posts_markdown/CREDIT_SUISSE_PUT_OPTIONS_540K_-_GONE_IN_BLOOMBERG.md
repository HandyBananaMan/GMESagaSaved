The 540,000 put options held by Credit Suisse are no longer in Bloomberg as of this morning. u/Ravada and I both posted screenshots of these two days ago. They had expirations dates of 10/15/21, so I'm not sure why they wouldn't be there anymore. Here is u/Ravada post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otxj0x/after\_my\_terminal\_post\_yesterday\_i\_checked\_again/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/otxj0x/after_my_terminal_post_yesterday_i_checked_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Here are the put options sorted by # of contract held in Bloomberg as of this morning (7/31/21):

Here is my screenshot from two days ago with Credit Suisse expanded to show that contracts held in the "multiple portfolios" were all indeed all puts:

Note that my screenshots have dates at the bottom right of the pics.

Edit 1: Note that Bloomberg does not have the Credit Suisse (BRA) put options in u/Ravada post on July 27.
