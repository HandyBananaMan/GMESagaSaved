Enjoy the rest of your weekend/Holidays if you're based in the US and Canada! Take a well-deserved break.\n\n**Edit:** Forgot to mention, if you have users asking to \"pass on theories\" to the sub, either direct them to this post or tell them yourselves to use the above two options!\n\n**Edit:** Having lots of afterthoughts here, please only submit \"quality\" posts through to SuperstonkBot.",
