Hey Everyone,

In light of the new Karma Requirements, this is a reminder to use  [https://www.superstonk.net/](https://www.superstonk.net/) where subreddit and non-subreddit participants can submit **anonymous** posts which will be reviewed by the Mod team and posted by u/SuperstonkBot in the sub if approved.

For those that want to get expedited approval (and have the relevant comment Karma reqs), remember to use **!apeprove!** to essentially "jump the line" to get checked and approved (or not) by Satori. **Note, even if your !apeprove! comment gets removed, it'll still be picked up by Satori to check you.**

Any questions, comment below. Enjoy the rest of your weekend/Holidays if you're based in the US and Canada! Take a well-deserved break.

**Edit:** Forgot to mention, if you have users asking to "pass on theories" to the sub, either direct them to this post or tell them yourselves to use the above two options!

**Edit:** Having lots of afterthoughts here, please only submit "quality" posts through to SuperstonkBot.
