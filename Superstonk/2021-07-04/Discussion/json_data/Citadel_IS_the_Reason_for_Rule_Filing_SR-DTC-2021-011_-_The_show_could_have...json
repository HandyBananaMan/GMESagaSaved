I hypothesized it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7vfvs/dtcc_update_submission_of_rule_filing/h32ej8v?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a week or so ago in another thread regarding the rule and u/[swede\\_child\\_of\\_mine](https://www.reddit.com/user/swede_child_of_mine/)'s recent DD makes me believe it even more now.\n\nBut, take this with a grain of salt as it could very well be and most likely is the ramblings of a crayon eating retarded ape & I'd really like to hear others thoughts on it.",
