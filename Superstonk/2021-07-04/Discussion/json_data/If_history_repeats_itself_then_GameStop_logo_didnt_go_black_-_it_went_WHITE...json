    "selftext": "ll take the downvotes and say I disagree, the GME logo has gone White. Ok, I googled GameStop logo history and realized that they did in fact have a white logo on black background before, but only for 1 year. Back in 1999 Barnes n noble owned Gamestop and in that transition they created an all-white logo on a black background. Then Barns later on at the beginning on 2000 acquired or bought a company called Funco. At this point Funco was renamed GameStop because Barns was planning splitting off GameStop into a company with a new ticker simple / as a NEW IPO. \n\nMaybe they\u2019re doing the same right now\u2026 Maybe history is repeating itself and they\u2019ve changed the logo White and will soon release a new logo / new ticker / and force all the current shares to transfer to the new ticker symbol\u2026 after all, one of the exects did NOT say that they were an ecommerce company, not a gaming company, what he said was that they were now a technology company,\u2026 AKA maybe we\u2019ll get something like GameStop Technology  -  GMET\n\n\nTLDR:  If history repeats itself then GameStop logo didn't go black - it went WHITE and the last time this happened was for only 1 year in 1999-2000 when they were owned by Barns (N) Nobel.... In 2000 Barns NN acquired Funco in and then changed the name of Funco to GameStop and broke it off into a new company. \n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop#Barnes_&_Noble_Booksellers_(1999%E2%80%932004)\n\n\nBarnes & Noble Booksellers (1999\u20132004)\n\nIn October 1999, Barnes & Noble Booksellers purchased Babbage's Etc. for $215 million.[14] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble Booksellers evaluated and signed off on the deal.[15] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, the owner of Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer FuncoLand, for $160 million.[16] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[17] With its acquisition of Funco,[18] Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[19] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[6][20] \n\nIn February 2002, the company once again became a public company via an initial public offering.[21] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22] \n\n\n1999-2000 Logo\u2019s\nhttps://logos-world.net/gamestop-logo/\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Awards and Karma..
