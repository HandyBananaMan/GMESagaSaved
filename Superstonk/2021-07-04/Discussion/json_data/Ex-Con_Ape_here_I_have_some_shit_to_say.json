    "selftext": "First and foremost, Happy 4th of July \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \n\nEdit2: **Happy Independence Day**\n\nOn this great day in this wonderful country that I love, I have been doing some thinking. I have been on this ride since January 28th. Literally bought in at the top. $469 a share. \nI\u2019ve held through it all. Average down at $40 and have averaged back up. I hodl many more* shares now. \n\nNot once have I even considered selling. Not once. Not for a second. I have had 100% conviction since the first shares I bought. I read the DD. I stayed up for 72 hours straight when I discovered GME and everything surrounding it. I was in no matter what. \n\nNow here I am, 5 or so months later, and still holding and buying more when I can. These shorts don\u2019t know who they are fucking with. I can wait motherfuckers. Oh, I can wait. I spent 3 1/2 years in prison. Yup. In California of all places. I waited 41 months just to breath free and fresh air. I can sit on the toilet for months if I have to. You know what I ate everyday that whole time? Top Ramen. Spreads (if you know you know). I scrubbed pots and pans in a fucking prison kitchen for $0.50 a day. I waited over 3 years to give my mom a hug (greatest lady on Earth. I love you, Mom \ud83d\udc9c). \n\nI saved every penny in there. I got out of prison almost 4 years ago. I got a good job. I have changed my life in every way. Prison changed me. I am lucky. \n\nAnd then along came GameStop and all you crazy mf\u2019s. When I got out of prison I thought I was going home. Not until I found my true family did I realize I found a true home. With all of you and with GameStop. This isn\u2019t just a company anymore. It\u2019s a family. It\u2019s an idea. It\u2019s a miracle in so many ways. This is what living is about. Making a difference! Fighting wholeheartedly in something you believe in. I believe in all of you and I know y\u2019all believe in me and that makes me one proud idiot. \n\nThe shorts fucked with the wrong one this time. \n\ud83c\udfae Power to the Players \ud83d\uded1 \n\nViva La GameStop! See you on the moon Fam. I got your back. Always \ud83e\udd1d \n\n\nLove, Dorvalis (aka Babushka)\n\n\n\nP.S. @ Kenny Boi Griffin: Fuck you. Let me catch you on the yard punk\n\nEdit: not sure what I missed but I see people commenting on the position statement in my post. I will remove it.* I don\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers. I must have missed the memo.\n\nEdit3: thank you all so much for the support! This is exactly why I feel at home here and I love all you crazy apes! Also: thank you to the haters and critics, for reminding me that y\u2019all still there \u270c\ud83c\udffc",
