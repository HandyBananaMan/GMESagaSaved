    "selftext": "I think that despite the fact that Citadel is doomed due to all the naked shorting, they're banking on crypto and other meme stocks to keep them afloat. \n\nThat's why they're kicking the can down the road. \n\nThey're using all these tactics of brigading, social media, pump and dumps to create fomo and to divert attention away from GME.\n\nThey're banking on 100:1 leverage in crypto. \n\nThey're banking on other companies to fail now. Movie company is billions in debt and if they don't survive because nobody goes back to the theater, then GG. Free untaxed profits. Don't know about all the other meme stock because GME is the only play but I'm sure they're also still at risk for bankrupty. \n\nThey're banking on GME having a bad quarter. Then they'll lay down the fud like never before. \n\nThey're banking on retail giving up. \n\nI know I'm not going to sell until I see my phone number in my account. This goes beyond just investing for me. My family has lost hundreds of thousands in the stock market due to shady msm articles followed by huge dumps. I know friends who IPO with companies and then their shares became useless because the institutional investors sold before the IPO. I'm tired of the elite rewriting the rules in their favor. \n\nOh yeah, I play to fucking win. \n\nPower to the players. Can't stop, won't stop, GameStop.",
