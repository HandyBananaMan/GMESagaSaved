    "selftext": "Assuming that all theories are correct, MOASS will be squeezing during one of the largest market crashes in history. There will be one security (maybe more, depending on how many have been shorted into oblivion) that\u2019ll be green in a sea of red. People will panic under immense losses and try to hedge. What\u2019s the best hedge that they can think of? Oh, right. That one security that\u2019s spiking to unimaginable levels. People buy in, thus\nexacerbating  the squeeze as non-\u201cmeme\u201d traders finally see what was brewing.\n\nEdit: just had a second thought that if tons of traditional retail investors buy in without knowing of its background, this will cause a lot more dumps during MOASS than we expect. This will NOT be a clean movement upwards, but an insane rollercoaster, making HODLing so much more important.",
