I was reading this DD ( [The Sun Never Sets on Citadel -- Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/od4bb1/the_sun_never_sets_on_citadel_part_2/) ) by u/![swede\_child\_of\_mine](https://www.reddit.com/user/swede_child_of_mine/) and this quote stood out to me:

>Let me it say again another way: we are at a point where MAJOR BROKERAGES AND EVEN EXCHANGES DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION WITHOUT CITADEL.

It made me think back to rule SR-DTC-2021-011 and specifically how it gives DTC the right to take over **any systems required to mitigate or facilitate the continuation of DTCâ€™s services**... ie - Keeping the market running.

Maybe Citadel hasn't met their fate yet as they're services are needed to avoid a market wide crash. I hypothesized it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7vfvs/dtcc_update_submission_of_rule_filing/h32ej8v?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a week or so ago in another thread regarding the rule and u/![swede\_child\_of\_mine](https://www.reddit.com/user/swede_child_of_mine/)'s recent DD makes me believe it even more now.

But, take this with a grain of salt as it could very well be and most likely is the ramblings of a crayon eating retarded ape & I'd really like to hear others thoughts on it.
