<p>ll take the downvotes and say I disagree, the GME logo has gone White. Ok, I googled GameStop logo history and realized that they did in fact have a white logo on black background before, but only for 1 year. Back in 1999 Barnes n noble owned Gamestop and in that transition they created an all-white logo on a black background. Then Barns later on at the beginning on 2000 acquired or bought a company called Funco. At this point Funco was renamed GameStop because Barns was planning splitting off GameStop into a company with a new ticker simple / as a NEW IPO. </p>
<p>Maybe they’re doing the same right now… Maybe history is repeating itself and they’ve changed the logo White and will soon release a new logo / new ticker / and force all the current shares to transfer to the new ticker symbol… after all, one of the exects did NOT say that they were an ecommerce company, not a gaming company, what he said was that they were now a technology company,… AKA maybe we’ll get something like GameStop Technology  -  GMET</p>
<p>TLDR:  If history repeats itself then GameStop logo didn't go black - it went WHITE and the last time this happened was for only 1 year in 1999-2000 when they were owned by Barns (N) Nobel.... In 2000 Barns NN acquired Funco in and then changed the name of Funco to GameStop and broke it off into a new company. </p>

<p>Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers (1999–2004)</p>
<p>In October 1999, Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers purchased Babbage's Etc. for $215 million.[14] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes &amp; Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers evaluated and signed off on the deal.[15] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes &amp; Noble acquired Funco, the owner of Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer FuncoLand, for $160 million.[16] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes &amp; Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[17] With its acquisition of Funco,[18] Barnes &amp; Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[19] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[6][20] </p>
<p>In February 2002, the company once again became a public company via an initial public offering.[21] Barnes &amp; Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes &amp; Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes &amp; Noble, making it an independent company.[22] </p>
