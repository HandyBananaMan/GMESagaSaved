<p>I was reading this DD ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/od4bb1/the_sun_never_sets_on_citadel_part_2/">The Sun Never Sets on Citadel -- Part 2</a> ) by u/<img alt="swede_child_of_mine" src="https://www.reddit.com/user/swede_child_of_mine/" /> and this quote stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me it say again another way: we are at a point where MAJOR BROKERAGES AND EVEN EXCHANGES DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION WITHOUT CITADEL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It made me think back to rule SR-DTC-2021-011 and specifically how it gives DTC the right to take over <strong>any systems required to mitigate or facilitate the continuation of DTCâ€™s services</strong>... ie - Keeping the market running.</p>
<p>Maybe Citadel hasn't met their fate yet as they're services are needed to avoid a market wide crash. I hypothesized it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7vfvs/dtcc_update_submission_of_rule_filing/h32ej8v?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here</a> a week or so ago in another thread regarding the rule and u/<img alt="swede_child_of_mine" src="https://www.reddit.com/user/swede_child_of_mine/" />'s recent DD makes me believe it even more now.</p>
<p>But, take this with a grain of salt as it could very well be and most likely is the ramblings of a crayon eating retarded ape &amp; I'd really like to hear others thoughts on it.</p>
