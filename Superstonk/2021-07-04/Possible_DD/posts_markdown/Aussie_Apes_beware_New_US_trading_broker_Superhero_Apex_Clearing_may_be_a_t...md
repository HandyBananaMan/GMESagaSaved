TLDR: New Australian US trading broker Superhero uses the clearing firm Apex, who back in Jan restricted trading and receive PFOF from Shitadel. Nice try at milking Aussie apes, Apex. (speculative: they're entering untapped markets to raise liquidity/ it's their last ditch effort to prepare for what's to come)

Woke up to a piss-poor piece of local journalism announcing [Superhero's US trading launch](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/superhero-launches-us-share-trading-as-more-australians-bet-on-markets-20210704-p586ol.html). Two paragraphs in, Dom reveals their US counterparty is none other than Apex Clearing Corporation LLC. So you will be custodian owners of any shares bought, which are cleared & held by Apex.

The zero dollar brokerage and 0.5% FX Superhero offers can seem quite tempting. But here's a quick recap of why it may be risky for Apex to hold your shares.

1. They halted trading in Jan, but possibly WORSE than Robbinghood. They are at the centre of brokers/clearing firms being sued atm for their collusion during the January run-up. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwklbg/looks\_like\_gamestop\_is\_cooperating\_with\_an\_sec/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwklbg/looks_like_gamestop_is_cooperating_with_an_sec/)
2. You are "protected" as per Apex's Safety of Customer Assets doc, also linked on Superhero's support page. [https://www.apexclearing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apex-Safety-of-Customer-Assets.pdf](https://www.apexclearing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Apex-Safety-of-Customer-Assets.pdf) Your insurance is 250k tops, not even worth 1 GME share. I know most other clearing firms follow similar protocols in the event of broker default. But I bet Apex falls sooner than brokers/clearing firms with deeper pockets.
3. They route retail orders to Shitadel and receive PFOF in return. That's where their profit lies. Retail traders are their product. When Shitadel falls so will Apex's revenue (as Shitadel pays the highest PFOF premium), increasing chances of their own default.

A [great DD on brokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mowzjk/the_broker_preparation_guide/) by u/socrates6210 compiled the list of brokers and their role in the Jan trading restrictions. Apex was a centrepiece.

In short, the general consensus is to avoid Apex. I'm sure there's more evidence out there that shows Apex's shadiness, many already posted in this sub or r/GME. You should be able to find them pretty easily (e.g posts about Apex affiliated brokers' Jan trading restrictions)

**Update:** Many apes asked me what brokers to use.

Lurker ape [u/Jewinsohn](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jewinsohn/) mentioned Schwab International is available for Aussie apes. There's a catch though, you need to deposit 25k USD to open an account. Not sure if share transfer is possible to meet that requirement. More wrinkly apes plz comment.

Otherwise, diversifying brokers is the way to go as many great apes have suggested. Be sure to check the custodian ownership deets. Most brokers disclose it somewhere on their websites. Ask if not sure.
