    "selftext": "Think about it, it\u2019s the morning of the MOASS. The premarket opens, not much happens. You think it\u2019s just another day of sideways trading. Then all of a sudden the spike happens. It hits $350 in a matter of seconds.  $420. $500. $750. $1000. \n\nThe adrenaline rush kicks in, suddenly you need to take a seat. You\u2019re dizzy. You take a drink of water and go back to watching the ticker climb. You call off work for the rest of the day.\n\n$10,000. \nYou log on to /r/superstonk, 500,000 people are online. Confusion and excitement floods the sub. The memes are off the charts.\n\n$50,000.\nYou\u2019re in disbelief, but you\u2019ve known for months this would happen. The countless hours you\u2019ve spent reading DD were right. You\u2019ve done your best to prepare for this moment. Now you\u2019re wondering how high will this actually go.\n\n$100,000.\nThe balance between the 1% and 99% are beginning to teeter. Suddenly the mega rich are fearing for their wealth while dumb money is becoming multimillionaires in a matter of hours.\n\n$1,000,000.\nA few days go by. You quit your job. You begin to realize you\u2019ll never have to work another day in your life. You won\u2019t have to fight and slave away anymore at a job that doesn\u2019t appreciate you.\n\n$10,000,000.\nA week passes. You\u2019ve found generational wealth. Your friends, family, children, will never have to work another day in their life. Euphoria takes you.\n\n$25,000,000.\nYou\u2019ve probably sold a few shares. You\u2019ve secured generational wealth. You quit your job, you hug your significant other and tell them to pick out their nicest outfit because you\u2019re going to drop $10,000 on dinner tonight. Now it\u2019s time to decide on what your ultimate vacation destination is.\n\n$50,000,000.\nYou\u2019ve sold a few mores. Now you\u2019ve left the remaining bit in the infinity pool. How far will this actually go? It doesn\u2019t matter, you have more money than you will ever need. It\u2019s time to return some of that wealth back into the community.\n \nI can\u2019t wait for tomorrow.\n\nEdit: As others in the comments have pointed out, only sell on the way down! This blew up a lot more than I anticipated!",
