Credit Suisse saying trillions are going to change hands seems timely since they got screwed by JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs in May. 

I've tried to do all the research neccessary to explain the collapse of Bill Hwang's hedgefund Archegos accurately. It should provide a cautionary tale for why you should never ever trade in margin. Story time!


Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume permits margin trading at 100:1 ratios. Meaning, you could post collateral of $1,000 dollars in your account, and Binance would loan you up to $100,000 (At a steep interest rate) you can trade with. So long as those trades do not go poorly and you keep up with the margin requirements, your trades stand.

The *maximum legal amount* a bank is able to allow trading in stocks on margin is 5:1. Right before the stock market collapse that preceded The Great Depression, it was common for traders be required to put $10-$20 of their own money down in order to trade $90-$100 worth of stock so 10:1 - 5:1 leverage. You'd be charged 5% APR on the loan, again, so long as you could outperform the interest you were being charged on the $90-$100, and your trades didn't go backwards, you were OK. If either of those things happened you were "margin called" and the bank would demand you post more collateral, or sell assets in order to cover the trades going poorly. If you couldn't, the bank steps in and sells all the shares, and collects cash as well as your collateral, and settles your accounts at a loss.

In a rapidly growing stock market filling up with investment, you can throw a dart at a board and earn money, so trading on margin might make you think (I can definitely outperform 5% YoY with the bank's money). For comparison, if you invested $100 in 1920, and held it until just before the stock market crash of 1929 you would have realized returns of 15.47% average year over year. Over 3X the interest you paid over that time. Just about anybody from bank presidents to kitchen cooks with cash wanted to use margin trading to give themselves investment income, and get a piece of the prosperity pie. Bonds were sold enmasse for funds, homes were mortgaged for cash, all that money poured into the stock market.

It was this bullish sentiment that caused the roaring 20s to, well, roar. The economy couldn't do any wrong. None of our infrastructure had been destroyed during WW1, so investment was pouring in from overseas too, and The Fed finally thought "Maybe we better calm things down" and they increased the margin interest rate from 5% to 6%. 


Stock prices slumped as investors cooled down, and a few weeks later recent traders who had just borrowed to the gills had trades going backwards and accruing interest and they got margin called. They couldn't pay, so the banks sold the stocks (At a loss), causing the price to fall further, which caused more margin calling, so the banks tried to buy blocks of stock themselves (think thousands of shares owned by one account) which stopped the plummeting for a day or so, but it wasn't enough, and stocks kept falling. We were in a bear market.

15 months after that, the stock market was anticipating a recovery. Then, the largest financial conglomerate in the South was heavily invested in the stock market, and those investments did poorly, forcing them to drain cash from banks in Tennessee they owned to cover their position. Those banks closed, so depositors started quickly going to other banks to withdraw cash, draining all available cash reserves. When those ran out, the remaining depositors started panicking, and fleeing to nearby towns to visit *those* banks to withdraw all their cash, and it was like a contagion from there ushering in the Great Depression.

But this isn't a story about that, it's a story about what happened in May.

You and I can't get 5:1 margin from a bank to trade in the market. But Hedge Funds can. And that's why Bill Hwange's Archegos Hedge Fund collapsed, because they basically went to all the various banks and said, "Hey give me 5:1, because that's the legal limit" and each bank went "fine!" except JP Morgan who said, "Hey you got busted for insider trading, no thanks." and months later said, "OK the fees we could be collecting from you are too tempting, and you've got insane returns YoY, we'll give you 5:1".


Meanwhile, none of the banks actually checked what the other banks had already done, and so Archegos effectively had 5:1 leverage with five banks in the stock market, and got busy pumping up stocks, including a struggling cable company "Viacom" whose stock he helped cause to 5X over the past year. They also got into Rocket, but we'll leave that alone for now.

Viacom executives had a board meeting where they said, "Hey man, our stock is absolutely insane and we're making so much money, why don't we go to the equity markets for funding, it will strain the stock a bit but we'll use that capital to become a Netflix competitor and our shareholders will thank us for it. So they announced issuance of Class A and Class B shares worth several billion dollars to be used on streaming investment and general corporate purposes (Sound familiar?). The stock predictably lowered due to dilution, but then guess who had built a super steep position in Viacom using 5:1 leverage five times over? Bill freakin' Hwang. If one bank margin called, the other banks would margin call too.


One bank noticed Bill Hwang was now in the danger zone on leverage, and then found out other banks were saying the same thing. The banks all got together on a Thursday and realized they were all holding shares of a shit sandwhich and it had to be eaten. Credit Suisse said "Hey guys, this sucks, but if we're strategic about this, we can work together to offload shares slowly with minimal impact to the price, and we'll all eat a small piece of this sandwhich". Let's start this Monday at market open, and all the other banks agreed to wait. So they margin called Bill Hwang, and got ready to do damage control.

Friday comes, and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan (Nobody is sure which said it first or both) said "I'm not eating any shit sandwich" and quietly but aggressively went into the market and started selling block shares to other hedge funds. The other banks (Deutsche, then Nomura) start hearing about it and get to work, doing the same thing. Credit Suisse wakes up late Friday morning from a horrible dream where it alone is eating the shit sandwhich only to realize it's not just a dream. The damage is done. The cut-throat American banks have unwound their positions and mostly come out completely unscathed, Nomura is vomitting from what it had to eat, and Deutsche says "We're eating our shit sandwhich but the shit is being used as a sauce for our tendies so we should break even". Credit Suisse eats whatever the lion's share of a shit-sandwich is, and the WSJ reported it's still taking bites of it as of June.

The two heads of Credit Suisse Brokerage resign in disgrace. Risk Managers are fired. Archegos loses $20 Billion dollars, the banks lose about $6 Billion. And this was all with 5:1 leverage at 5 banks. 20X that and you have the current state of what Binance is doing. Imagine if Bill Hwang had had some friends in Europe, and a Binance account...


**Edit:** Coincidentaly, in the 1930s an ancient but not broadly used investment strategy from 17th Century Holland was being tried out in the US stock market. Short-selling. Seriously, 1934, look it up. It helped cause The Great Depression.

**2X Edit:** I made a mistake writing Archegos as being 20:1 leveraged, but it's actually correct to say they had 5:1 but at five banks. Meaning if he failed margin mintainance requirements at one, the other four would be impacted. Hence the banks meeting up to coordinate their response.
