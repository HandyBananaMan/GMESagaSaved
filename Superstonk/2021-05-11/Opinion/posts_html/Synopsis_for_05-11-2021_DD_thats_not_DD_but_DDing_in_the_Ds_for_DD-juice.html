<p>Good morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole,</p>
<p>Do you smell that?</p>
<p>*insert flashy intro card*</p>

<p>GOOOOOD MOOOOORNING EVERYONE!</p>
<p>So let's go!</p>
<p>First of all I want to tackle a few things I've been noticing, this post is not news but more opinion stuff.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>Mayo posting</h1>
<p>I've seen a lot of people suddenly post a lot of stuff regarding Mayo. This immediately triggered a "forum sliding" feeling for me, so I thought I'd help the situation a bit.</p>
<p>for the people who want to look at DD and only DD there are some sweet buttons on the side that say "DD" and "possible DD", if you click those you'll only see D'est of D's </p>
<p>For mobile click on the Superstonk sub and then go to the "about" page, scroll down and you'll have the same buttons.</p>
<p>This means you can click to see the content you want and filter out the stuff you don't want to see.</p>

<h1>Flash! AHAAAAAA</h1>
<p>Yesterday we saw a sharp decline in price... no kidding it was just about 10% and we've seen worse and we've seen it before. if you need a good indicator on why this is happening it's good to look at the TA people of the sub, I am to smoothbrained to do TA but if you read a lot of their work you may even get a wrinkle.</p>
<p>The thing that's interesting to me is the latest post of u/wardenelite, in it he describes multiple scenarios that could happen and what they may be able to do on a technical level to give off certain ideas.</p>

<p>But more specific I like this image </p>

<p>Go give his thread a read if you'd like, I know I liked it and gives me a good idea of what they may be trying to do right now.</p>

<p>For the new Apes and apettes I want to repeat a simple manta we have had here since day one.</p>
<p>Buy the dip, Hodl, repeat.</p>
<p>Sounds simple right ? because it is. <br />
Shitadel and others may want to wriggle out of this, but it's been established that a few things happened.</p>
<p>The DTCC said on record that they did not margin call anyone in January, meaning more than likely the same SI% or higher is still correct.</p>
<p>Robinhood will fuck you over, don't look at just GME look into the companies history they seem to halt trading for multiple things, going from crypto to stocks, because the guys that pay them for orderflow hold their strings, so be smart look at a better dealer/broker and look for one who wont fuck you.</p>
<p>Melvin got a 2 billion influx of cash to not get margin called in January, and have been "closed" since then (seen a lot of posts/messages on several boards saying that their phones are disconnected or not ringing, no public statements or activity and nothing has been heard from them since) so they may be out of business for the most part (this is pure speculation as no one knows exactly what's going on).</p>
<p>Gary Gensler is now in his 4th week.</p>
<p>We have had some great AMA's hosted by u/jsmar18 and u/atobitt which gave us some great new insights and even having Dave Lauer join the board and help explain some stuff (like the NYSE darkpool thing was not a darkpool thing but rather a datafeed thing) and we have more to come!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Final note</h1>
<p>We have an awesome news crew which I am particularly proud of, u/pinkcatsonacid and u/bye_triangle, and I'll be working with them from now on to make the news, this means the news can be posted by anyone of us as I don't want to go back to a one man show haha, I love my Brick and Veronica and can't wait to see today's news.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank all the other mods who help keep this place in order each and every day, and all the amazing sub members being so damn awesome to each other, it warms my heart to see everyone trying to be on their best behaviour and help each other.</p>
<p>One last thing of note, if you find a new filing, don't be afraid to say </p>
<p><strong>"I found this but I don't know what it means"</strong></p>
<p>legalese is difficult even for people who come from a legal background so don't be afraid to say you just don't know, you're bringing new info and maybe the wrinkle brains can make sense of it! </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
<p>But don't forget</p>
