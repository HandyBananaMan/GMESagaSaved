<h1>DTCC Liquidity Test (again)</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-002.pdf"><strong>So the DTCC is having a liquidity test this Thursday May 13th.</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/Clearing-Services/FICC/CCLF-Annual-Test-Reference-Doc.pdf">What the hell is a liquidity test anyway?</a></p>
<p>Well... This doesn't effect anything in the market in real time, it is merely a computer simulation test meant to test the liquidity of the market. But liquidity tests do require... liquidity. So you might need to sell a few things to rack up those liquid assets.....</p>

<h1>Massive Sell of in DOW, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, and C0ins</h1>

<h1>The SEC awards 2 new whistleblowers with rewards totaling $22 Million</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-81">The first whistleblower received an award of $18 million, while the second whistleblower received a $4 million award.</a>  The larger award was in recognition of the fact that, among other things, the first whistleblower was the initial source of the investigation while the second whistleblower submitted information much later after the investigation was already underway.        </p>
<p>“This case demonstrates once again the value of the whistleblower program in helping to protect investors, and the Commission’s continued commitment to rewarding individuals who provide high-quality tips,” said Emily Pasquinelli, Acting Chief of the SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower.  “The reporting of credible information by these whistleblowers and their subsequent cooperation with the staff’s investigation allowed the Commission to better understand complex transactions related to the matters under investigation.”</p>
<p>$18 MILLION IS A LOT OF FRICKIN DOUGH FOR WHISTLEBLOWING. THEY HAD CENTRAL INFO TO THE INVESTIGATION. THAT'S A BIG ASS RAT! 🐀</p>

<h1>Bringing attention to the OBV once again - there has not been any significant selling since FEBRUARY. On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicates (in SPITE of the price action) that the trend has been on BUYING for the last 3 months. Good job, apes.</h1>

<p>What the heck that means according to Dave Lauer, after a post claiming this would put an end to rehypothecation:</p>
<p>So unfortunately I don't think this is saying what you think it's saying. Now to be fair, I haven't had time to review in-depth. Couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any broker that facilitates trading <strong>already</strong> has to be registered, with FINRA.</li>
<li>The Consolidated Audit Trail is the system that will be collecting trading data and will be used for forensic examinations for market manipulation. This system has been under development for almost 10 years, and is finally being rolled out, starting last year.</li>
<li>This filing appears to be focused on security-based swaps, not the equities market. That's more focused on what happened with Archegos than what is happening with trading in the equities market. I don't believe anything here is directly related to the equities market, except insomuch as it's focused on security-based swaps. -<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9abxf/i_dont_know_how_this_is_not_being_talked_about/gxmsr3h?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">u/dlauer</a></li>

<h1>👀 New Mod-Only Post Flairs 👀</h1>
<p>After an influx of requests for tighter moderation in the sub and much deliberation amongst the mod team, we decided it would be best to instead of removing questionable/unverified/contended posts, we would instead create some Mod-only use post flairs that we can assign when posts have been determined to be unverified, or totally debunked.</p>
<p>So we decided that removing some posts was too much, and instead made a mod-only flair</p>
<h1>⚠Inconclusive⚠</h1>
<p>so we can mark posts that seem suspect, inconclusive, or are potential FUD. OP can then revise their post with accurate info to have flair updated. Additionally, you apes can still see the post, and it's very transparent in what we are considering to be suspicious or potential FUD without removing it. You can then discuss for or against a flair change in the comments;</p>
<p>We also added the</p>
<h1>🚨Debunked🚨</h1>
<p>flair to the mod-only flair lineup. Please note, we will still remove posts that blatantly break rules; but this way we can manage in a transparent way whether to be cautious or not with posts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8irtwr9maey61.jpg?width=758&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afe80c1078d68010371c01ddcc5e6e92bca5f4e8">Stupid is as stupid does</a></p>
<p>On that note, I made an error in yesterday's post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9326x/sro_filings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">which I corrected as soon as I saw dave lauer's explanation on the matter</a>. We are all human and we all make mistakes. I want to stress the fact that if OP gets marked with the inconclusive flair and they bring verifiable data to back it up, the flair can be changed by mods. And note that while not exclusive to DD and education posts, that's the majority of what we had in mind when creating these flairs.</p>
<p>We're all just a bunch of smooth brained apes tryin' to get a couple wrinkles here. ✌</p>

<p><strong>This is an AMA you do NOT want to miss!!</strong></p>
<p>All this time since January, we have been searching for answers, slowly peeling away the shit onion to expose more shit layers when we read DD like House of Cards. Screaming into the void, wondering where tf the SEC is. Or the White House is. Why isn't anyone doing anything to make this right.</p>
<p>I know we don't talk dates or catalysts around here. But I need apes to understand how game changing it will be when everyone exercises their right to vote. And Carl is coming to help us understand that. <strong>The importance of this AMA cannot be overstated.</strong></p>
<h1>THIS IS HOW WE EXPOSE THE MARKET FUCKERY IN A WAY THEY CAN'T DENY!!</h1>

There are many ways to safely get a package without giving your address. But I can't even afford to go visit my family out of state, I promise I won't show up in Germany or some shit unless it's post MOASS and I'm tryna buy a castle. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</em></p>
