The Consolidated Audit Trail is the system that will be collecting trading data and will be used for forensic examinations for market manipulation. This system has been under development for almost 10 years, and is finally being rolled out, starting last year.\n3. This filing appears to be focused on security-based swaps, not the equities market. That's more focused on what happened with Archegos than what is happening with trading in the equities market. I don't believe anything here is directly related to the equities market, except insomuch as it's focused on security-based swaps. -[u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9abxf/i_dont_know_how_this_is_not_being_talked_about/gxmsr3h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Doritos for the Class (spicy)\n\n[Will she go up or down?](https://preview.redd.it/vhovvgnpfey61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=87c0da4d2ef0612562729e8ca3b8bd2430296b0c)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# \ud83d\udc40 New Mod-Only Post Flairs \ud83d\udc40\n\nAfter an influx of requests for tighter moderation in the sub and much deliberation amongst the mod team, we decided it would be best to instead of removing questionable/unverified/contended posts, we would instead create some Mod-only use post flairs that we can assign when posts have been determined to be unverified, or totally debunked.\n\nSo we decided that removing some posts was too much, and instead made a mod-only flair\n\n# \u26a0Inconclusive\u26a0\n\nso we can mark posts that seem suspect, inconclusive, or are potential FUD. OP can then revise their post with accurate info to have flair updated. Additionally, you apes can still see the post, and it's very transparent in what we are considering to be suspicious or potential FUD without removing it. You can then discuss for or against a flair change in the comments;\n\nWe also added the\n\n# \ud83d\udea8Debunked\ud83d\udea8\n\nflair to the mod-only flair lineup. Please note, we will still remove posts that blatantly break rules; but this way we can manage in a transparent way whether to be cautious or not with posts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Stupid is as stupid does](https://preview.redd.it/8irtwr9maey61.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afe80c1078d68010371c01ddcc5e6e92bca5f4e8)\n\nOn that note, I made an error in yesterday's post, [which I corrected as soon as I saw dave lauer's explanation on the matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9326x/sro_filings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). We are all human and we all make mistakes. I want to stress the fact that if OP gets marked with the inconclusive flair and they bring verifiable data to back it up, the flair can be changed by mods.
