The Carlsberg AKA Carl Hagberg nod was cool and all, but we missed the juice of it, which was sitting right in front of us.

# THERE. That triangle, sitting right in front of your face, where have you seen one of those before?

# BOOM. TITS JACKED.

u/WardenElite and all our crayon wizards keep talking about **triangles** and wedges. So I deep dived into it.

This is the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle) for **triangles:** 

    A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted △ABC.

# Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?! 

# A B C?! 

# As in ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ?! 

# That’s the Alphabet!

And what is the Alphabet’s stock ticker? 

# GOOG.

# BOOM. 

[Google](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/), alright, but what about Google? Why is GameStop talking about Google? What breadcrumbs did they leave for us? So it got me thinking...

The astronaut in the picture is clearly in space. So why the fuck does he have a beer he can’t drink? If he takes off his helmet then he's dead. BUT WHAT IF it wasn’t a beer, and instead it was a clue! It’s pointing up! What **didn’t** Google do today? It didn’t go up! So much red!

# Why didn't go up? 

Because [ad growth is slowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/ad%20growth%20is%20slowing). And everybody knows that the Asian markets are the largest source of advertisement revenue in the world. And who owns the Asian markets? ASIAN MONEY. 

# And what is ASIAN MONEY an anagram for?

That’s right. The GameStop social media team just gave us Citadel’s Achille’s Heel. They told us to stop, relax, and just trust the mayo and we’ll all be on the moon soon.

Thank you for coming to my TEDxTalk.
