TITS JACKED.\n\nu/WardenElite and all our crayon wizards keep talking about **triangles** and wedges. So I deep dived into it.\n\nThis is the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle) for **triangles:** \n\n    A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted \u25b3ABC.\n\n# Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?! \n\n# A B C?! \n\n# As in ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ?! \n\n# That\u2019s the Alphabet!\n\nAnd what is the Alphabet\u2019s stock ticker? \n\n# GOOG.\n\n# BOOM. \n\n[Google](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/), alright, but what about Google? Why is GameStop talking about Google? What breadcrumbs did they leave for us? So it got me thinking...\n\nThe astronaut in the picture is clearly in space. So why the fuck does he have a beer he can\u2019t drink? If he takes off his helmet then he's dead. BUT WHAT IF it wasn\u2019t a beer, and instead it was a clue! It\u2019s pointing up! What **didn\u2019t** Google do today? It didn\u2019t go up! So much red!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2h86libqly61.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=833206c0e6a994f2bef8ad127eeed6a4dd7e4da4\n\n# Why didn't go up? \n\nBecause [ad growth is slowing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/ad%20growth%20is%20slowing). And everybody knows that the Asian markets are the largest source of advertisement revenue in the world. And who owns the Asian markets? ASIAN MONEY. \n\n# And what is ASIAN MONEY an anagram for?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7snwfqrrply61.gif\n\nThat\u2019s right. The GameStop social media team just gave us Citadel\u2019s Achille\u2019s Heel. They told us to stop, relax, and just trust the mayo and we\u2019ll all be on the moon soon.\n\nThank you for coming to my TEDxTalk.",
