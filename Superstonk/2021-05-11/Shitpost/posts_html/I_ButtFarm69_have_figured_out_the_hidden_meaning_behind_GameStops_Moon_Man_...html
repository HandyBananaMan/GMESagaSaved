<p>The Carlsberg AKA Carl Hagberg nod was cool and all, but we missed the juice of it, which was sitting right in front of us. </p>

<h1>BOOM. TITS JACKED.</h1>
<p>u/WardenElite and all our crayon wizards keep talking about <strong>triangles</strong> and wedges. So I deep dived into it.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle">Wikipedia entry</a> for <strong>triangles:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted △ABC.

<h1>Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?!</h1>
<h1>A B C?!</h1>
<h1>As in ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ?!</h1>
<h1>That’s the Alphabet!</h1>
<p>And what is the Alphabet’s stock ticker? </p>
<h1>GOOG.</h1>
<h1>BOOM.</h1>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/">Google</a>, alright, but what about Google? Why is GameStop talking about Google? What breadcrumbs did they leave for us? So it got me thinking...</p>
<p>The astronaut in the picture is clearly in space. So why the fuck does he have a beer he can’t drink? If he takes off his helmet then he's dead. BUT WHAT IF it wasn’t a beer, and instead it was a clue! It’s pointing up! What <strong>didn’t</strong> Google do today? It didn’t go up! So much red!</p>

<h1>Why didn't go up?</h1>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/ad%20growth%20is%20slowing">ad growth is slowing</a>. And everybody knows that the Asian markets are the largest source of advertisement revenue in the world. And who owns the Asian markets? ASIAN MONEY. </p>
<h1>And what is ASIAN MONEY an anagram for?</h1>

<p>That’s right. The GameStop social media team just gave us Citadel’s Achille’s Heel. They told us to stop, relax, and just trust the mayo and we’ll all be on the moon soon.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TEDxTalk.</p>
