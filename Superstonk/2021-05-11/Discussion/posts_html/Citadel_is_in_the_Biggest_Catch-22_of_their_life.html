<p>Citadel found themselves in an extremely important Catch-22 that involves both GME and AMC.</p>
<p>Before anyone downvotes or disregards this post just hear me out. I very well count be wrong but it makes sense.</p>
<p>What we know:
Citadel has a liquidity test on Thursday.
Amc borrow rate hit 80%
GME dropped 11% 
We are at the end of the MOAW</p>
<p>How it connects:
Citadels liquidity test coming up is a huge opportunity for them to avoid a margin call. So today to prepare, they short attack tf out of gme to get those liabilities down and sell some tech stocks so boost their assets. This explains the 11% drop and a huge red day for the market.</p>
<p>By doing this the hedgies also try and convince apes that we are falling out of our MOAW. After reading wardens DD they realized we were hyped and they dropped the price. However Warden did talk about a possible short ladder after the wedge followed by a slow upward trend. Yes hedgies we do read. The drop and wedge went as expected and are perfectly fine.</p>
<p>This is where amc comes into play. The amc borrow rate spiked to 80% and the price went up 10% or so. The amc apes are hyped and word is likely getting out as GME saw a similar borrow rate spike before the baby squeeze. This is the catch-22. If citadel chooses to short amc to drop the price their interest payments will be huge and their liabilities will increase. If they do nothing and let amc run they will see the same spike in their liabilities. ALL BEFORE THEIR LIQUIDITY TEST THURSDAY.</p>
<p>IF THEY FAIL THEIR TEST THEY WILL BE MARGIN CALLED AND THE DOMINOS WILL FALL</p>
<p>Tl:Dr hedgies fukd, gme is on a fire sale.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the support guys, means a lot! To the people saying this is an amc message blah blah blah, it’s not. Check my post/comment history it’s obvious what side I’m on</p>
<p>EDIT2: People in the comments asking if amc will moon before gme. There is no way to tell. Apes with more wrinkles than me have speculated that it could happen as their last effort to get apes to sell GME. GME is over 100% shorted, and we own the float. GME is much more catastrophic to them than amc.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: Liquidity test post</p>
