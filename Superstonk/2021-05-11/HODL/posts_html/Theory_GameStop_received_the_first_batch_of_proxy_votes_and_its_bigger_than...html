<p>We all saw the post from GameStop today on their Instagram and Twitter page. (Also Facebook?)</p>
<p>My theory is that they either received the first batch of proxy votes and itâ€™s more than 100% or we surpassed the 100% just now and they are going to post soon. </p>
<p>TLDR: we are going to the moon and GameStop is waiting for us.</p>
<p>EDIT: they edited GS (GameStop) on his right arm. My ape tits are jacked</p>
