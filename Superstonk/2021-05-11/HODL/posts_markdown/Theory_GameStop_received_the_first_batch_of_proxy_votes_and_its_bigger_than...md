We all saw the post from GameStop today on their Instagram and Twitter page. (Also Facebook?)

My theory is that they either received the first batch of proxy votes and itâ€™s more than 100% or we surpassed the 100% just now and they are going to post soon. 

TLDR: we are going to the moon and GameStop is waiting for us.

EDIT: they edited GS (GameStop) on his right arm. My ape tits are jacked
