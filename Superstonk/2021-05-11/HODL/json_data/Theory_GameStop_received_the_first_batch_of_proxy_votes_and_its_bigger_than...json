(Also Facebook?)\n\nMy theory is that they either received the first batch of proxy votes and it\u2019s more than 100% or we surpassed the 100% just now and they are going to post soon. \n\nTLDR: we are going to the moon and GameStop is waiting for us.\n\nEDIT: they edited GS (GameStop) on his right arm.
