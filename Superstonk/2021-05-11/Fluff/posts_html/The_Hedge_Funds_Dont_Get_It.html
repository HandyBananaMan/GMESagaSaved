<p>Literally the ONLY thing that will get me to sell my GME shares is the back side of MOASS.</p>
<p>Not FUD, not AMC, not price drops, not cryptoo, not messaging me, not marketed disinformation campaigns, not IAMGME hashtags, not flooding this message board with bad memes.....NOTHING</p>
<p>LET ME REPEAT,  NOTHING, will get me to sell my shares until MOASS.ðŸš€</p>
<p>See yâ€™all on the Moon.</p>
<p>Edit:  Thanks Apes for the awards!  This was just my morning coffee rant!</p>
<p>Edit #2:  I had this calm come over me as I drove the kids to school this morning.  A total realization and buy in to this whole experience.  I can honestly lose what I have in GME, all of it, and still go on in life without much changing.  But I now have reached a zen where I will have no emotion throughout MOASS selling on the way down.</p>
