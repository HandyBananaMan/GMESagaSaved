    "selftext": "Literally the ONLY thing that will get me to sell my GME shares is the back side of MOASS.\n\nNot FUD, not AMC, not price drops, not cryptoo, not messaging me, not marketed disinformation campaigns, not IAMGME hashtags, not flooding this message board with bad memes.....NOTHING\n\nLET ME REPEAT,  NOTHING, will get me to sell my shares until MOASS.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSee y\u2019all on the Moon.\n\nEdit:  Thanks Apes for the awards!  This was just my morning coffee rant!\n\nEdit #2:  I had this calm come over me as I drove the kids to school this morning.  A total realization and buy in to this whole experience.  I can honestly lose what I have in GME, all of it, and still go on in life without much changing.  But I now have reached a zen where I will have no emotion throughout MOASS selling on the way down.",
