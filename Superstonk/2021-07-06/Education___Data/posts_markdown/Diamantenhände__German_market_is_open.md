Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes across the world! üëãü¶ç

Thank you to everyone who joined us on July 5th to watch the German market while the US markets were closed! It's amazing to read through the comments and experience the positive energy that people bring to this community. Thank you to the mods of r/Superstonk for their endless work in fostering such a vibrant community!

Since the US market will reopen today, this thread will be back to the usual first two hours before US pre-market. I received some helpful information about where to get live data from a higher volume exchange, so I'm going to be using a different data source for today's Diamantenh√§nde (now with volume!). Today is July 6th, and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange!

###üöÄ Buckle Up! üöÄ

FAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current price and volume from https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099 and converting to USD. Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18574732. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.

Many among the Diamantenh√§nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Over a week ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.

Diamantenh√§nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!
