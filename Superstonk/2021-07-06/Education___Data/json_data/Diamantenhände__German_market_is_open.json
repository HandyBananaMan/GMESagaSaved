    "selftext": "Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes across the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nThank you to everyone who joined us on July 5th to watch the German market while the US markets were closed! It's amazing to read through the comments and experience the positive energy that people bring to this community. Thank you to the mods of r/Superstonk for their endless work in fostering such a vibrant community!\n\nSince the US market will reopen today, this thread will be back to the usual first two hours before US pre-market. I received some helpful information about where to get live data from a higher volume exchange, so I'm going to be using a different data source for today's Diamantenh\u00e4nde (now with volume!). Today is July 6th, and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 120 minutes in: $205.99 / 173,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 648)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 115 minutes in: $205.99 / 173,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 647)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 110 minutes in: $205.99 / 173,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 641)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 105 minutes in: $205.98 / 173,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 637)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 100 minutes in: $205.98 / 173,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 636)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 95 minutes in: $205.97 / 173,70 \u20ac  *(volume: 622)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 90 minutes in: $205.96 / 173,69 \u20ac  *(volume: 614)*\r\n- \u2b1c 85 minutes in: $205.93 / 173,67 \u20ac  *(volume: 559)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 80 minutes in: $205.93 / 173,67 \u20ac  *(volume: 559)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 75 minutes in: $205.90 / 173,65 \u20ac  *(volume: 538)*\r\n- \u2b1c 70 minutes in: $206.25 / 173,94 \u20ac  *(volume: 360)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 65 minutes in: $206.25 / 173,94 \u20ac  *(volume: 360)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 60 minutes in: $206.35 / 174,03 \u20ac  *(volume: 254)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 55 minutes in: $206.46 / 174,12 \u20ac  *(volume: 202)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 50 minutes in: $206.43 / 174,10 \u20ac  *(volume: 189)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 45 minutes in: $206.70 / 174,32 \u20ac  *(volume: 145)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 40 minutes in: $206.70 / 174,32 \u20ac  *(volume: 144)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 35 minutes in: $206.68 / 174,30 \u20ac  *(volume: 124)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 30 minutes in: $206.74 / 174,35 \u20ac  *(volume: 119)*\r\n- \u2b1c 25 minutes in: $206.73 / 174,35 \u20ac  *(volume: 113)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 20 minutes in: $206.73 / 174,35 \u20ac  *(volume: 113)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 15 minutes in: $206.70 / 174,32 \u20ac  *(volume: 92)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 10 minutes in: $206.64 / 174,27 \u20ac  *(volume: 54)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 5 minutes in: $206.62 / 174,25 \u20ac  *(volume: 51)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 US close price: $202.83 / 171,06 \u20ac   *($202.83 / 171,06 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current price and volume from https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099 and converting to USD. Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18574732. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.\n\nMany among the Diamantenh\u00e4nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Over a week ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
