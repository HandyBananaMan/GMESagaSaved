Must. Close. Every. Short. Position. \n\nSay it with me. Say it ten times. Say it to your spouse. Say it to your friends. Say it to your damn computer. \n\nSHORTS. MUST. CLOSE.\n\nEdit: bring me your downvotes shills! I've seen what makes you cheer\n\nEdit 2: u/6days1week pointed out below that it was technically correct when the MSM reported that HFs covered their positions back in January. This is why we should be mindful about what words we use, because that'll be important when this eventually hits the courts and congressional hearings.\n\nEdit 3: for those wondering if there's a difference: covering a short means you have enough capital to essentially sustain the short position and afford the interest on such position. Closing means you've bought back the share that you borrowed, and have paid market price for it. What we are waiting for is the massive amounts of closings that SHFs will be forced into by Marge & Call. All shorts must be closed. Shorts must close. Shorts close. Short Close. Shoclo?",
