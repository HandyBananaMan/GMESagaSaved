    "selftext": "# So it begins\n\nHere is the share price history we all know and love <3!! It \\*does\\* look like history is repeating itself. Specifically the area some of the most recent data to that back in March.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/749k5va8xn971.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6d2c915770d45db8c389e1e3dd0113ed1d1a0b\n\nI snipped the June / July data and overlaid it on the March / April data while also adjusting the height of 3/15 and 6/10 to match one another.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzdjl2mgxn971.png?width=1263&format=png&auto=webp&s=407f09d56fb0b51b341d7e11305ef6166ba40bcc\n\nHere is the zoomed in image of the March / April timeline with the most recent June / July. Immediately, one can see not only is the same overall trend continuing but almost every day has the same colored candlestick.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt9gn1rrwn971.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=01de7a87a93cfe97b2843f276040012652a953e9\n\nHere's another overlay of images without any adjustments to length to show how the trends are EXACTLY THE FUCKING SAME:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ab116bvko971.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdf677e18529e06b463386b034e23184e7bd4cdf\n\n# Putting Numbers to Candle Sticks\n\nUsing 3/15 and 6/10 as our corresponding Day 1, we now have 18 data sets for each timeline.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vukb6b69o971.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=73cdd97ac817721c999279b1571387fabadb5c21\n\nThe below graph shows the OHLC of March / April and June / July for their corresponding days. Shit looking EERILY similar, eh??\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j02k1rg19o971.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a447c6e71ed7b4f1a933e483d9c0d0da815f1a2\n\n# It's so Dark! We need some CANDLESTICKS! ZOOM Enhance!!\n\nSo MORE zoom into that big ass candlestick we names as day zero!! Even with June red dildo stretched out like old ricky's butt hole to match the same length as March, the close and high have the same ratio size. This is circled in rotten banana color.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cg9qqrsa1o971.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=129af2e399c532be54f3de007541fddee0a0f695\n\nIt looks like we can compare the wick and the upper body of the candlesticks against each other.\n\n# BUT FIRST\n\nLet's refresh our memory on how candlesticks work. Both the red and green have the same locations for their highs and lows, however, their open and close are different:\n\n[Candlesticks!!](https://preview.redd.it/vgeijt5d2o971.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=c55b37214afe7f75306c5124538344237fe8cd85)\n\n# Back to the Mathemagics!!\n\nSince we're just wanting the top part, we'll do some shitty excel \"coding\" so our column labels \"Open\\_Close\" will have the largest value whether it is the open or the close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddyyr3qc9o971.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ea41d34c3a0024f6e5ef0fd3f338f43a81f2ee\n\nLet's make histograms of that \"Open\\_Close\" and see what happens!! The top section is for March / April and the bottom is for June / July. That one dot for both graphs happens to be Day 1 for both. We can exclude this point and we have a normal distribution. (Normality has been tested but negated to show for ease of understanding). Looks like there's like a $30 shift between the two.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zckufui5ao971.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d5879ae01f756052904c4d6d8acff0d58bb4fa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's graph the data from March / April and June / July against each other. It's looking REALLY FUCKING linear to me. The rotten banana circled is comparing 3/24 and 6/21. Makes sense since 3/24 was really fucking known T+21.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbdbh79meo971.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=48e58e5fa62cae3e1a3b9cdd933982cfcfe56a50\n\nLet's add an equation to match!!! Oh fuck!! We even got a decently high R\\^2.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jdosppdxeo971.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=87fb1c7a94a00b846382ff03e0e8288e0063d040\n\n# Just for shits and Giggles\n\nLet's see how far back it goes with our 3/15 and our 6/10 dates matched up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2nzc6wuqo971.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a82c2ee58b396a70b3c2752de24d2b0149dccc3\n\nAnd another bivariate plot for you apes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0qeun0svo971.png?width=1329&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f54da6fa1931cac780717616f91a02f2ee7f0b\n\n# In Conclusion:\n\nTL;DR: March / April and June / July data are looking statistically similar to one another. Shit may go further back than that.\n\n# Thoughts:\n\nOf course the same algorithm has been used, however, this would suggest there is a correlation that extends further in time than a single shorting amount for 1 day. It's all linked.\n\nEdit 1: Added another overlay image\n\nEdit 2: Thoughts\n\nEdit 3: [GME Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME)\n\nEdit 4: Shits and giggles\n\nEdit 5: Another bivariate plot\n\nEdit 6:  [tweet](https://twitter.com/pwnwtfbbq/status/1412557445143031811?s=20)\n\nEdit 7: Needed to highlight how this data also included July data.",
