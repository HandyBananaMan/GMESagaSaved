I'll keep you up to date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~So, thats great, but what about GME dude....Later that day or tomorrow you will find the extracted GME data from the data collection here - I just didnt have the time so far to extract the pure gme data from the data set - but just look back this evening or tomorrow and you will find it here.~~\n\n~~And the excel sheet?...... Yes. Will also follow up here.~~  \n\n\nLook at the bottom of the thread.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[But perhaps you keep in mind that out there are a lot charities doing great work you can support.](https://preview.redd.it/77o5w0uzuk971.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=4670b6913941eedbb4447c4baf01303f2831e956)\n\nSo thats it.If you got any questions, reach out to me!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext data collection that will be published will contain Rule 605 Data to make it easier for every retail to look into Order Execution Quality and how good their orders are routed. Rule 605 data has to be published for every month, containing the information of how many orders/shares had been routed, how good or bad the orders had been executed and many other informations. - So stay tuned.\n\nBest wishes and have a great week!\n\nYour\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[datAnnihilationGod](https://preview.redd.it/pwuaj1fzyk971.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68f945a74e2b708d88552bb8a13e1befd23ddf2c)\n\nPS: My daily Short Volume Ratio Update for GME can be found on twitter: Annihil4tionGod  \n\n\n  \nADD: 8.
