Hello again everyone,

As promised, I am here to continue slowly reading through every minute of GME's day to check for weird shit to do with the volume, and oh boy do I have a big post ready to share with you later today/early tomorrow once I have finished typing it up. 

Obligatory - I am not a financial advisor, this is not, and should not be taken as financial advice.

For those of you who don't know, I have observed that GME has an oddly high amount of minutes in the day with more than 1% of the total day's volume being traded (for context each minute should have an average of 0.256% of the day's volume). So I have decided to count how many happen each day, what percentage of the total volume they make up, and how this compares to last week's statistics (check my previous posts here).

Any minutes with volume of 1%+ in relation to the day's total volume will be referred to as **Majorly Significant Ticks,**  
Minutes with volume of 0.8%-1% of the day's total volume will be referred to as **Minorly Significant Ticks.**

**Before I get onto today's update, I'll quickly explain why the DD I promised on why this has been happening didn't come out over the weekend as I had originally promised, so if you don't give a fuck about that and just want the numbers, feel free to skip to the end.**   


I have since been given data for **every single minute of GME's trading since 2019** and like any moron would do, I tasked myself with looking at every important event in the last 6 months of our trading to see if anything looked weird at a minute-by-minute basis. And wouldn't you know it - **our volume has always been weird as fuck, apart from the few days it hasn't.** Inspiring stuff, I know, but these normal days are actually the most interesting thing in the whole DD. Anyway, the reason this DD has taken so long is simply that I have found out a lot more shit than I thought I'd ever gain from doing this, and it's now taking much longer to gather all the data and actually type out why I think this is happening - but the good news is I actually now have theories on why it's happening! So my patience has paid off, hopefully yours will too and you'll actually think the DD is good.

**Anyway onto today's stats**

**Week beginning 6/7 (yes 6th of July, deal with the date being the correct way around)**

6/7  
Volume - 2,604,813

**Total Majorly Significant Ticks - 11**  
Total Minorly Significant Ticks - 6

**Total Significant Ticks - 17**

**Majorly Significant Tick total volume - 467,306 = 17.9% of the total volume for the day.**  
11 Majorly Significant ticks represent **2.82% of the day's minutes for 17.9% of the volume.**

**Total Significant Tick volume - 602,790 = 23.1% of the total volume for the day.**

**Therefore, the 17 largest ticks of the day, representing 4.36% of the minutes of the day, were responsible for 23.1% of the volume**

&#x200B;

*Here's how this compares to last week* 

 

**5 day average volume of Majorly Significant ticks as % of total daily volume**  
% of ticks (out of 390 minutes in trading day) - **3.26%**  
% of daily volume - **20.06%**

**5 day average volume of all Significant ticks as % of total daily volume**  
% of ticks (out of 390 minutes in trading day) - **5.18%**  
% of daily volume - **26.7%**

**5 day average Majorly significant ticks - 12.8**

**5 day average Minorly significant ticks - 7.4**

**5 day average significant ticks outwith 10 min of open/close - 14**

***The above are the averages for the whole week beginning 28/6/2021.***

Just before I go, a special shoutout must be given to my boy 12:39 today, a fat red crayon in the middle of the day, 12:39 was responsible for 73,177 trades, making up 2.8% of the day's trades - and he resulted in a **MASSIVE PRICE DROP OF $1.13!!!** 

I don't know about you guys, but that seems like a whole lot of effort for a price drop of a little over a dollar,

I hope to see you tomorrow, and at the DD that's coming soon,
