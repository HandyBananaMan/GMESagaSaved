Hey, it's me again - The dude with the boring data collection!

After some more reserach and many hours of downloading, searching and structuring, its finally done:

**Version 2 of my data collection is available with more sources and like before: Free for everyone.**

&#x200B;

![Me finding more data, realising its not over yet.](https://preview.redd.it/kw2oaftjvk971.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f1f1fc7f2d688c22bbc4ae51eb0d8afebcd467b)

**So, what is new about the data, or - what can be found in the new data set**

I uploaded and zipped the collection in 4 parts that I can provide a VirusTotal Scan for the files.

**What is Virustotal?**

Wiki:  *"VirusTotal aggregates many antivirus products and online scan engines to check for viruses that the user's own antivirus may have missed, or to verify against any false positives."*

![Me waiting for the uploads to complete that the data can finally go public - but I just got a countryside internet connection.....](https://preview.redd.it/ayydtdd4vk971.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb5643467f1ff2b80b48917fe358f61d115e70e)

Concerns I have regarding the data set:Perhaps some of you already observed that some market codes (Last Column in every file) are the same - but the reported numbers are not.This raises the question, if all data has to be used or if some files could contain other market information without tell us about this fact.

For this reason, I reached out to FINRA and my bank to get an answer on the question: What files/exchanges/sources have to be used for a correct data collection? - So far i got no response - both mails were send 13 days ago. I'll keep you up to date.

&#x200B;

~~So, thats great, but what about GME dude....Later that day or tomorrow you will find the extracted GME data from the data collection here - I just didnt have the time so far to extract the pure gme data from the data set - but just look back this evening or tomorrow and you will find it here.~~

~~And the excel sheet?...... Yes. Will also follow up here.~~  


Look at the bottom of the thread.  


&#x200B;

![But perhaps you keep in mind that out there are a lot charities doing great work you can support.](https://preview.redd.it/77o5w0uzuk971.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=4670b6913941eedbb4447c4baf01303f2831e956)

So thats it.If you got any questions, reach out to me!

&#x200B;

Next data collection that will be published will contain Rule 605 Data to make it easier for every retail to look into Order Execution Quality and how good their orders are routed. Rule 605 data has to be published for every month, containing the information of how many orders/shares had been routed, how good or bad the orders had been executed and many other informations. - So stay tuned.

Best wishes and have a great week!

Your
