<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>This pertains to $GME ownership among the U.S. adult population. If you'd like to know what this post is all about, please take a moment to hit up the original post below. It contains tons of info like <strong>methodology, links to result, surveys for other countries, research bias details, sample size calculators, other resources, and lots more:</strong></p>

<p>So ... my follow on survey completed over the weekend, providing another 400 samples for a total of 700. I haven't checked, but at 700 I imagine the margin of error is around 3%. That said, I just wanted to provide this quick update with this larger sample as I know folks were curious.</p>
<p>FYI, as this is a randomized sample from a massive pool of participants, combining these sample in such a way is totally kosher.</p>
<p>Here's how things shook out:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/5i7269716p971.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c956f8084d0b63281c9abc00128488b92593530">**U.S. retail only. Doesn't include foreign retail, insiders, ETFs\/mutual funds, institutional investors, family firms, hedge funds ... or those juicy open shorts.</a></p>
<p>\~If I've made any math error in the above, I assure you it wasn't intentional, but I'd appreciate it if you could kindly point out my mistake so I can correct.\~</p>
<p>I should mention that when I posted the initial results, someone reached out and said they started a survey to gather 1,500 samples. I reached out to this person a short while ago via PM, but haven't heard back yet. That said, since my 400 just recently completed, I imagine their 1,500 survey is still running strong. But I will update this post, should I hear back from them.</p>
<p><strong>******If you have any questions or comments about sample size or methodology, I do ask that you please visit the OP first. Not on;y is there a ton of details in the post, there were also more than 600 comments on the thread with lots of great ideas, insights, suggestions, and just some very good discussion.******</strong></p>
<p>Finally, this: None of what I am saying is financial advice, and I encourage everyone to do their own research when it comes to $GME, the stock market, and investing in general.</p>
<p>My personal advice: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. And as an aside ... if you have a guest in your home and they ask for some of your mayo, don't be a dick. Please share your mayo.</p>

<p>Edit #1: I guess I should post the survey result links here, huh? Sorry, there they are for anyone who wants to slice and dice the data:</p>
<p>Survey #1 (N=300): <a href="https://surveys.google.com/reporting/question?hl=en-US&amp;survey=sv2uhkuhypyl6olmiokx2zzkma&amp;question=1&amp;raw=true&amp;transpose=false&amp;tab=chart&amp;synonyms=true">https://surveys.google.com/reporting/question?hl=en-US&amp;survey=sv2uhkuhypyl6olmiokx2zzkma&amp;question=1&amp;raw=true&amp;transpose=false&amp;tab=chart&amp;synonyms=true</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Survey #2 (N=400): <a href="https://surveys.google.com/reporting/question?hl=en-US&amp;survey=gei6t23feekehqpuxr5woosr5a&amp;question=1&amp;raw=true&amp;transpose=false&amp;tab=chart&amp;synonyms=true">https://surveys.google.com/reporting/question?hl=en-US&amp;survey=gei6t23feekehqpuxr5woosr5a&amp;question=1&amp;raw=true&amp;transpose=false&amp;tab=chart&amp;synonyms=true</a></p>

<p>Edit #2: I heard back from the person who was running <strong>the 1,500 sample size</strong>, and it's almost complete (1,356/1,500). Below is a quick calc. of the current results, and the link to the survey for anyone who wants to play around and slice/dice the data. Google has a pretty good interface for breaking out demographics, etc.</p>
<p>So, without further ado ... this larger sample size results in:</p>
<p>Ownership: 5.6%</p>
<p>Avg. Shares: 32.5</p>
<p>As you can see, these results pretty closely align with the initial 700 sample (5.71% ownership and 39.5 share avg.) ... this larger sample size supports all the above results. The average share count has a little more flex than I'd like to see, but again, I've intentionally capped the count at 101 to guarantee a very conservative number here.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the survey (I'm not sure if the owner wants to be named, but I am asking ... if they are okay with that, I will update once I hear back):</p>
