    "selftext": "How\u2019s this for FUD; I\u2019m **bored**, **tired**, **impatient**, **frustrated** and occasionally **doubtful**. As I watch my parents age and feel the fire of mortality on my asscheeks, I wonder if I should take my GME gains and start another venture so at *least* they can buy a house to retire in. Captain Hook has long been a pile of reptile shit and Tick-Tock the Croc is back on the clock.\n\nThere\u2019s only *one* thing that could make me feel worse about this whole situation and that would be **SELLING**! It\u2019s painful even to consider. The thing hedgies want most is the last thing I\u2019d consider a *solution* to my problems. Funny how that backfired on them eh?\n\nThere is, however, a *long* list of things that make me feel *better*:\n\n**1.** **BUYING MORE** \ud83d\ude05 Every time I buy more it unlocks a new level on my favorite mobile game, *Calculator*.\n\n**2.** GME *consistently* **dips** on *good news*. (Who *didn\u2019t* see today\u2019s dip coming after announcing west coast fulfillment?) This shit is all the confirmation bias I *need* to see we are **right**.\n\n**3.** GameStop\u2019s constant improvement with customers, their website, product expansion, etc. (watch what we do, not what we say)\n\n**4.** **THE VIDEO GAME & TECH INDUSTRY**. This is the future of entertainment and convenience. It\u2019s everything. We know it, RC knows it. Barring an apocalyptic, grid-destroying event- this shit ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere and it\u2019s only going to get better and better. If you know, you know.\n\n**5.** And finally you fucking **APES**. Who knew there were so many *decent* degenerates in the world? How could I leave this community? Why would I subtract this level of chaotic positivity from my life? I can\u2019t afford to.\n\n**Isn\u2019t it ironic? Don\u2019t ya think?**\n\nEvery SINGLE tactic SHFs have used and continue to use to shake us off does *exactly* the opposite. It\u2019s an infuriating and hilarious dance.\n\nIf GME had slowly climbed from $40 with little bumps on good news I probably would have believed shorts had covered bc the stock was behaving somewhat normally. I probably still would have invested, but not as heavily and with such conviction. *They. Fucked. Up.*\n\nWe are *pacified* by the shares we buy during the dips they hope will shake us.\n\nWe are *emboldened* by downward movement on positive news.\n\nThe serpent continues devouring its tail in a negative feedback loop unwittingly optimized for apes \ud83d\ude42\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what people can adapt to and I\u2019m adapting to this. I can buy and hodl *indefinitely*, let\u2019s see who runs out of money first.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
