Howâ€™s this for FUD; Iâ€™m **bored**, **tired**, **impatient**, **frustrated** and occasionally **doubtful**. As I watch my parents age and feel the fire of mortality on my asscheeks, I wonder if I should take my GME gains and start another venture so at *least* they can buy a house to retire in. Captain Hook has long been a pile of reptile shit and Tick-Tock the Croc is back on the clock.

Thereâ€™s only *one* thing that could make me feel worse about this whole situation and that would be **SELLING**! Itâ€™s painful even to consider. The thing hedgies want most is the last thing Iâ€™d consider a *solution* to my problems. Funny how that backfired on them eh?

There is, however, a *long* list of things that make me feel *better*:

**1.** **BUYING MORE** ðŸ˜… Every time I buy more it unlocks a new level on my favorite mobile game, *Calculator*.

**2.** GME *consistently* **dips** on *good news*. (Who *didnâ€™t* see todayâ€™s dip coming after announcing west coast fulfillment?) This shit is all the confirmation bias I *need* to see we are **right**.

**3.** GameStopâ€™s constant improvement with customers, their website, product expansion, etc. (watch what we do, not what we say)

**4.** **THE VIDEO GAME & TECH INDUSTRY**. This is the future of entertainment and convenience. Itâ€™s everything. We know it, RC knows it. Barring an apocalyptic, grid-destroying event- this shit ainâ€™t goinâ€™ nowhere and itâ€™s only going to get better and better. If you know, you know.

**5.** And finally you fucking **APES**. Who knew there were so many *decent* degenerates in the world? How could I leave this community? Why would I subtract this level of chaotic positivity from my life? I canâ€™t afford to.

**Isnâ€™t it ironic? Donâ€™t ya think?**

Every SINGLE tactic SHFs have used and continue to use to shake us off does *exactly* the opposite. Itâ€™s an infuriating and hilarious dance.

If GME had slowly climbed from $40 with little bumps on good news I probably would have believed shorts had covered bc the stock was behaving somewhat normally. I probably still would have invested, but not as heavily and with such conviction. *They. Fucked. Up.*

We are *pacified* by the shares we buy during the dips they hope will shake us.

We are *emboldened* by downward movement on positive news.

The serpent continues devouring its tail in a negative feedback loop unwittingly optimized for apes ðŸ™‚

Itâ€™s amazing what people can adapt to and Iâ€™m adapting to this. I can buy and hodl *indefinitely*, letâ€™s see who runs out of money first.
