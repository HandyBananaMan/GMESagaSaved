<p>Howâ€™s this for FUD; Iâ€™m <strong>bored</strong>, <strong>tired</strong>, <strong>impatient</strong>, <strong>frustrated</strong> and occasionally <strong>doubtful</strong>. As I watch my parents age and feel the fire of mortality on my asscheeks, I wonder if I should take my GME gains and start another venture so at <em>least</em> they can buy a house to retire in. Captain Hook has long been a pile of reptile shit and Tick-Tock the Croc is back on the clock.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s only <em>one</em> thing that could make me feel worse about this whole situation and that would be <strong>SELLING</strong>! Itâ€™s painful even to consider. The thing hedgies want most is the last thing Iâ€™d consider a <em>solution</em> to my problems. Funny how that backfired on them eh?</p>
<p>There is, however, a <em>long</em> list of things that make me feel <em>better</em>:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>BUYING MORE</strong> ðŸ˜… Every time I buy more it unlocks a new level on my favorite mobile game, <em>Calculator</em>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> GME <em>consistently</em> <strong>dips</strong> on <em>good news</em>. (Who <em>didnâ€™t</em> see todayâ€™s dip coming after announcing west coast fulfillment?) This shit is all the confirmation bias I <em>need</em> to see we are <strong>right</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> GameStopâ€™s constant improvement with customers, their website, product expansion, etc. (watch what we do, not what we say)</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>THE VIDEO GAME &amp; TECH INDUSTRY</strong>. This is the future of entertainment and convenience. Itâ€™s everything. We know it, RC knows it. Barring an apocalyptic, grid-destroying event- this shit ainâ€™t goinâ€™ nowhere and itâ€™s only going to get better and better. If you know, you know.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> And finally you fucking <strong>APES</strong>. Who knew there were so many <em>decent</em> degenerates in the world? How could I leave this community? Why would I subtract this level of chaotic positivity from my life? I canâ€™t afford to.</p>
<p><strong>Isnâ€™t it ironic? Donâ€™t ya think?</strong></p>
<p>Every SINGLE tactic SHFs have used and continue to use to shake us off does <em>exactly</em> the opposite. Itâ€™s an infuriating and hilarious dance.</p>
<p>If GME had slowly climbed from $40 with little bumps on good news I probably would have believed shorts had covered bc the stock was behaving somewhat normally. I probably still would have invested, but not as heavily and with such conviction. <em>They. Fucked. Up.</em></p>
<p>We are <em>pacified</em> by the shares we buy during the dips they hope will shake us.</p>
<p>We are <em>emboldened</em> by downward movement on positive news.</p>
<p>The serpent continues devouring its tail in a negative feedback loop unwittingly optimized for apes ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Itâ€™s amazing what people can adapt to and Iâ€™m adapting to this. I can buy and hodl <em>indefinitely</em>, letâ€™s see who runs out of money first.</p>
