<p>Likely this was noticed elsewhere, but I realized for myself that the gap of time between the share offering and July 14th is 34 days. Just to point out why I care about 34, remember that if it gets to 35 then covering for FTD's starts getting taken out of the hands of hedgies, so they want to get it done prior to the cut off.</p>
<p>To point out a quick historical comparison, the April share offering began on April 5 and T+35 later was when we began the run that went from May 11- June 10.</p>
<p>Since that June 10th date, % of shares sold short has been anywhere to 50-65% daily, price slowly decreasing on very little volume (\~ minus $6 a week), and going off stonk-o-tracker it looks like FTDs right after 6/10 shot up although we only see two dates of that. So July 14th might be kicking off the next round of large amounts of FTD's hitting the T+35 threshold.</p>
<p>Now what if those T+35 settlements line up with the NFT release? All the general public sees is the price increasing (FTD settlement) after an NFT was announced. To the uninformed viewer, they think the NFT is driving the price upwards. And maybe to a degree it would, but also there's the behind the scenes of the FTD settlement. If only we could see what FTD's looked like after June 10.</p>
<p>What else is happening right after the 14th? July 16th and that insane amount of OTM puts expiring. What happens when those expire and don't get rolled to another date? The put writer who was using those as a way to reset the FTD clock (because on paper it looks like they'll be buying shares) can't keep kicking the can. So from the 14th on, we see the T+35 timer from June 10 kicking in and should start stacking FTD's.</p>
<p>But what if they do reroll? For one, that is an absolutely massive number of puts that have historically had sky high OI. I'd hope (and I know it shouldn't be a lot to ask for) that this immediately gets the SEC's attention to say "hey we explained that what you are doing is a crime" and they actually do their job. On the other hand, whoever is buying those puts is gonna be seen as a participant in the crime. Back in early Feb when the contracts were originally bought maybe they could then argue there was evidence to say the price would go right back down. But now with the GME cash in reserve and business improvements how do they justify believing in it going to $5? So would these guys open themselves up to be accused of fraud when they already know they are going to take a massive financial hit?</p>
<p>Here are the things I need some more wrinkled brains to dig into that would either reinforce or poke holes in this thought....</p>
<p>- how does 005 tie into options? I believe there was language in it relating to not creating bullshit contracts.</p>
<p>- Is there any way to see the late June FTD data early?</p>
<p>- Deep OTM worthless puts are only a viable option because they are gonna be extremely cheap. If they just put them at reasonable strike prices then the cost to buy them is much more expensive. However the assumption is even if they did go ITM, they won't be exercised because the holder doesn't actually have the shares. How much more expensive would it be if they tried to move the entire strategy up to higher ($180-200) strikes?</p>
<p>- Strategy wise, and maybe this isn't a wrinkle brain idea but just something to mull on, would these events lining up next week signal to shf that its time to race for the exit or would this be like the movement T+35 after the April share offering where it's a slow drift up to the first failed margin calls? If it's a slow climb then I'd guess the shf still have a few cards left they plan on playing to try and delay the inevitable. If it's a more violent shot up then my guess is they realize there are no more moves and its a race to get out first.</p>
<p>Edit 1: Decided to take this mornings news and look back to before the previous run. Welp, this is likely nbd but for some baseless tit jacking........On may 3 we got news of GME expanding the fulfilment network with a facility in Pennsylvania. A week later we went on that run. TODAY we hear about a facility in Nevada.....and a week later puts us in July 14th territory. Like I said, there's no reason to believe this is some special or meaningful connection but it's neat to pick out similarities.</p>
