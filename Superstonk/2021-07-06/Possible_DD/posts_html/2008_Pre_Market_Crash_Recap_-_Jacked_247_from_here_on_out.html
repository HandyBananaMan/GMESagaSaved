<p>Was looking at 2008 pre market crash news and saw something that happened then and  (i think) we just experiened June 23rd 2021 when Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac securities lost their value. Keep in mind I am a true retard and I know the situations were way different and possibly this has no value.</p>
<p><strong>9/7/2008 Headline:</strong>  The U.S. government places Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,  companies that together hold more than half of the country's mortgages,  under government conservatorship, which is akin to bankruptcy  reorganization. U.S. treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., says the  move was crucial to avoid turmoil in the national and international  economies. "This turmoil would directly and negatively impact household  wealth: from family budgets, to home values, to savings for college and  retirement,? he says. ?A failure would affect the ability of Americans  to get home loans, auto loans and other consumer credit and business  finance. And a failure would be harmful to economic growth and job  creation</p>
<p><strong>Almost exactly 3 weeks later - 9/7/08 was a Sunday, but if you only count from the following Monday it IS exactly 3 weeks later:</strong></p>
<p><strong>9/29/2008 (Market Crash Day):</strong>   In a stunning move that leaves the financial world in  disarray, the House rejects the bailout plan, 228 to 205. Only 65  Republicans vote in favor of the bill, despite strong pleas by President  Bush; 140 Democrats support the measure. The Dow Jones Industrial  Average drops 778 points, it's biggest point decline ever.</p>
