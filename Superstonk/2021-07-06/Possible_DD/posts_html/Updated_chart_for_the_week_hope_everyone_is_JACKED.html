<p>Hey Apes, hope everyone had a great weekend.  Thought I'd give an update on the Dorito chart, looks like GME is consolidating for a massive break out. Moon soon?</p>
<p><img alt="This is the one day chart.  I speculate a MACD crossover this Thursday or Friday.  Volume is very low.  From what I can see the Market makers algo's were able to break the diagonal support , but weren't able to push it down any significant amount.  Looks like someone is running out of money LMAYO" src="https://preview.redd.it/5uwxqsg78m971.png?width=986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ca8fe8fab45acb1a14e99e719e55c97c6dd7b5b" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Lets looks at the 4 hr chart.  Look at that MACD on the bottom! looks to me that the rocket is ready to take off any day now! awe yes, dorito shape.  Looks like they broke down, but its stuck above the 193.  Not good for the hedgies cuz when volume picks up this shit is going to flyyyyy.  The cup and handle is still intact, I'm looking forward to when that breaks out.  Until then, I think we will end up trading sideways.  From a TA perspective we could POSSIBLY see a gamma squeeze leading to the MOASS.  As we all know this stock is heavily manipulated.  These losers are spending A LOT of money to break the trends.  Hedgies are so fukd'd and market crash is imminent.  " src="https://preview.redd.it/w7a11re5cm971.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ecba920b458bc9009f6fe4dfa23a0858c8780e" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="I think the Cup and Handle is the best pattern to indicate a parabolic break out.  The handle could consolidate another week or 2 before breaking out, but with how the MACD is going to cross over soon on the 1 day, and on the 4 hr it looks like a fart will blow this thing up.  I'd say one good catalyst and it can start the rocket, but as we know good news means the price goes down.  With how deep this goes and how the DTCC is cooking their books to hide counterfeit shares, it looks like the only way this one go to the moon is if they are forced to cover.  I speculate the NFT is going to have something to do with that. until then we're kind of stuck between 190-207.  I'd imagine we stay in that range this week, and maybe even next week.  Honestly, it can take off ANYDAY though. with the 195 as a STRONG support it looks like 7\/15 is going to be the breaking point.

<p>I also think that they NEED to drive the price down to keep marge away from calling.  They are most definitely running out of money.  That's why they are asking the fed for money to help kick the can down the road.  We all know how this is going to end, so lets sit back and watch the shit show.  I think the next upward movement will be to much for shitadel and friends.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let's look at other indicators as to wen moon.  Lets look at the 4 hr spy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="there is still a gap from 6\/23 and looks like a death cross is coming. Wasn't 002 passed on that day? I wonder if that has any connection.  Looks like a market crash is coming, could be this week or next week.... but it's coming and it's going to be UGLY" src="https://preview.redd.it/rfqg68qehm971.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5ba090f956339ffdfd8fa9391ea7485337958db" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Lets look at the 1 day for spy, looks like it topped out and the MACD is heading for a death cross as well. Hedgies, DTCC, banks, and FED are FUK'd.  " src="https://preview.redd.it/7d4wezu4im971.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39afe53836beb6724f861285324c4788b0f1ef15" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>for the last picture, lets look at VIX</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="This is the 1 day for VIX.  Looks like a golden cross on the MACD..... to me that looks like volatile times are coming! yay. " src="https://preview.redd.it/n5yvwkgzim971.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94ba89c8bfc3b813a405bd2289819df8e80160f7" /></p>
<p>GME looks like it's going to trade sideways as the market tanks and volatility picks up.  like u/criand said.  If the market crash's GME will moon, or if GME moons the market is going to crash.  From a TA perspective I see both happening.  Buckle up! shit is going to get CRAZY.  I also want to say that I love all you guys, this is a great community and it's been such a great time! looking forward to making the world a better place after the MOASS</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> GME broke out of the wedge and will consolidate until the next huge move.  The cup and handle is still forming and looks like it will break out any day.  Spy looks like it's going to tank any day, and VIX is indicating volatile times are coming up. Buckle up!</p>

<p>Update for 7/7: I'm very jacked!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="1 day chart. we are in a downward ascending chanel.  We still haven't broke the cup and handle yet. MACD is inching closer to a crosser.  I think when it cross's over GME go boom" src="https://preview.redd.it/suzqai8b9u971.png?width=1017&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d10132f2036097c9f97fb4f667ce6148ac43a052" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="this is the 4 hr chart along with what i think will happen.  MACD is looking nice and ready to blow up, I marked vertical lines to mark important dates.  NFT is the first one 7\/14, and then the next two lines are the from GAMESTOPS tweet on when we are landing on the moon 7\/20-8\/20. Tin foil hat i know haha but it lines up with the cup and handle break out.  I think we can break out the handle any day ( maybe this week?) and bounce off the 480.  then NFT is released on the 14th and possibly a big announement? but IF that did happen we will literally go off the chart haha" src="https://preview.redd.it/myle8tyiau971.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b287f40e2e5a5fca18742ff4cfcfdc4ff45b239c" /></p>
<p>I wonder if they did the announcement of the fullment center to test how much ammo they had left to set up the next move.  Like a dividend being paid out on a date Gamestop chooses too?</p>
<p>This is not financial advise and I eat crayons.  Looks like shit is going to happen soon and I'm so jacked!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this is spy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="it can crash almost any day still " src="https://preview.redd.it/q8qdycbwcu971.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a5429fbb1831e0b427676fb18f30b60fdd6937" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="finally a Dorito! VIX is still looking prime for a break out and volatile times" src="https://preview.redd.it/kkf7cou8du971.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4753806a7f5b3f3ecc4fe7cde671905f78780f46" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Nothing has changed since yesterday, except that we are getting closer to take off! Cup and handle is still forming and getting ready to test new highs. Gamestop tweet moon landing 7/20 lining up with this beautiful set up. I'm very jacked</p>
