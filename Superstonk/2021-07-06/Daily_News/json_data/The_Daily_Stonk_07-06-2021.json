I see 103M hidden shorts\n\nu/WhatCanIMakeToday made a thead [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oenvoh/peekaboo_i_see_103m_hidden_shorts_part_deux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nHis post goes into checking the married puts/calls action, worthless OTM married puts are to hide short interest and Deep ITM calls are to hide/reset FTD\u2019s and after Feb 1'st they went up quite a bit.\n\nIt's an interesting read and idea that they indeed try to hide their short position with deep itm/otm married puts and calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwnri9mr7k971.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8230fbd2f2721f046cd82064813d5aa4398a0c7\n\n# The apes of the group\n\nu/zedinstead made a list of all the apes and what they do in the sub, it's good to keep this aside just in case it ever becomes useful for you, it's ranging from dank memelords to people who post TA.\n\nthe list can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oek6xl/im_just_a_guy_that_likes_the_stock_and_likes_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[no one is quite sure

down\n\n[https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/goldman-sachs-predicts-us-shares-to-begin-falling-20210705-p586yf](https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/goldman-sachs-predicts-us-shares-to-begin-falling-20210705-p586yf)\n\nNow goldman is predicting that the us shares will fall soon, now isn't that a thing \ud83e\udd14\n\nBut wait there is more.\n\nReuters is reporting that our current situation isn't unlike other situations we've had before, mainly the crashes, but this time it's worse.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/chancellor-this-time-isnt-different-scarier-2021-06-03/](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/chancellor-this-time-isnt-different-scarier-2021-06-03/)\n\n(also this is written by  Edward Chancellor not THE chancellor)\n\nAnd the Zoltan also saying there is danger on the horizon\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisses-zoltan-warns-of-trouble-ahead-in-money-markets-11625391002](https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisses-zoltan-warns-of-trouble-ahead-in-money-markets-11625391002)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow if I were a wrinkled ape, I would think this spells out danger for the banks/stockmarket in the months to come. but I know I'm smoothbrained at best\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y531tywu5k971.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=45cccf8065baa9b34f39fae309f98b623d3c4762\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/baxpq78f6k971.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=68a0f9c52e856430c184eb047357e7047b4b3544\n\nDaily

RC's tweets are timed with ETF FTDs\n\nu/dentisttft also has a theory that he might need some more eyes on, because perhaps this one holds true, and we can fill in the blanks were needed, or it's false and we can see why.\n\nEither way it's interesting as hell to think about and think that there may be something there\n\nYou can check out his thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oeahh2/rcs_tweets_are_timed_with_etf_ftds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xk1lno7y8k971.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&s=648c8daad71b0bb7ecfadcf5f02fafa80b30f7ff\n\n# Technical TA math stuff\n\nu/MOSfriedeggs made a TA, which shows mostly bullish signals, and even something that's even more rare then we normally see in TA **Historical Volatility Percentile** signal was given off last month, meaning we could see some big rips in the coming weeks.\n\nCheck out his thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/od7swq/wen_moon_10_endgame_final_ta/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmfn665z8k971.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be07f86f0a4a67e9bb3e2c28dabc2258eee5bdc\n\n# EXCELLENT!\n\nBe friendly, help others!\n\nas always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.\n\nThis doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.\n\nWe help each other, we care for each other.\n\n**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**\n\nthis helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.\n\nremember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.\n\nThere is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\nRemember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6z3wh119k971.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb1c6d1204518d6404068c60ddc2cb7a54cd0b3\n\nremember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.\n\nIf anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.\n\nbackups:\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\n[https://twitter.com/ByeTriangle](https://twitter.com/ByeTriangle)\n\n[https://twitter.com/u\\_sharkbaitlol](https://twitter.com/u_sharkbaitlol)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BradduckF](https://twitter.com/BradduckF)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit
