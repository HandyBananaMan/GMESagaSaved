&#x200B;

Every trading day for the longest time, u/DerGurkenraspler gave us a live update from Germany. While taking some time away due to personal reasons, u/Parsnip has carried the torch with the daily updates like clockwork. It was pointed out that OP DerGurkenraspler has since deleted his account. So I really would just like to say if you're reading this, Superstonk wishes you well and we hope you are safe and healthy and happy! And also, all the love and good vibes to Parsnip for continuing the daily posts. The community built in the comments of these posts are what makes Superstonk so incredible and unique. Thank you for making the jungle beautiful!! 💖💖💖

# Updates on Automod Requirements, Satori Approval, Superstonk Bot, and more

&#x200B;

💡 ***Most*** **posts screenshotting comments will be removed for spam.** The upvotes and awards provide the proper visibility, within context of the entire post it's associated with. This is sufficient for bringing proper content to visibility. Posting screenshots like this is a known shill tactic to acquire karma ("karma farming") because they know it's popular, relevant content that will get them lots of awards and upvotes. There might be a few exceptions as this is largely at moderator discretion, thus it not being a blanket rule. We try to let the spirit of democracy reign and votes decide, but as we grow, the need to curate quality content grows as well.

💡 **Any posts made "in favor of someone who doesn't fit the automod reqs" will be removed for circumventing our sub rules. Often times this content is from a shill account, trying to spread FUD.** If someone wishes to submit a post to the sub, but they don't meet the requirements, please direct them to [www.superstonkbot.net](https://www.superstonkbot.net)

Superstonk bot is an anonymous DD submission tool that anyone in the world can access. Submitted posts are then reviewed by a team of community members- which does include mods like u/Jsmar18, u/Leaglese, u/hey_madie, and others- and is subsequently approved for posting if they meet community requirements.

&#x200B;

💡 **Satori Approval is Limited by Reddit to how many accounts can be approved per day.** If you have commented !apeprove! I assure you that your name is on the list of those up for review. Please note that being placed on this list does not necessarily guarantee your approval, it only ensures you are reviewed ahead of the general membership. It also surpasses the karma and age requirements if you are approved, so even if you don't meet the rising requirements, you are already an approved user and will continue to enjoy free access to all aspects of the sub. Once an ape, always an ape (until you leave, I guess). **You will receive a message once you are approved!**

*Approved users are still bound by the regular automod requirements*

&#x200B;

💡 **New Karma and Age requirements**

*Once again I reiterate, once approved, you bypass these requirements.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

💡**Crossposting now limited with only named subs being an exception.** r/GME and r/DDintoGME have been added to the automod "safe list" of approved crossposts coming in and out of the sub. Any other subs are still restricted from crossposting to and from Superstonk. This is part of our continued effort to fight brigading, and we really appreciate your cooperation in implementing all these emergency rules to protect the sub. We will strive to continue to ease the earlier restrictions as is appropriate.

# The Media Narrative is Shifting

&#x200B;

As the $GME ~~world domination~~ saga unravels, MSM is getting the hint that they need to say *something*. So we're seeing more and more stories talking about Gamestop, "meme stocks", and a general impending market crash.

&#x200B;

Business Insider had an interesting article on it this morning. No I won't link it. I don't like giving them clicks. You'll see it at the top of your Broker news most likely.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kdpuxbc19m971.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f99411d30b9718a6005652d61bff8ea92c86173c

&#x200B;

Remember that Leon Cooperman is the infamous "Fair share is a bullshit concept" dude. It's part of the lore of GME and we mustn't forget. [Link for reference.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI-nItz56Fs)

&#x200B;

**We also saw a shoutout this morning from Yahoo Finance.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0w8pcnaojm971.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5096e7ae618ce7e12fa490b2045fac1c9edc6f7

So let me get this straight.

&#x200B;

We are considered a valid source of information- albeit just as a barometer of public sentiment at this time, but still- if we are a community worth lurking, and quoting then why the continued silence on the issues we discuss in this community?

&#x200B;

Where's the article covering the [House of Cards?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlwqyv/house_of_cards_part_3/)

&#x200B;

How about a link to the [Superstonk Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index)?

&#x200B;

Say "Naked Shorts" like CNBC did and link some of the DD we have explaining it.

&#x200B;

[Here's my Beanie Baby DD from months ago explaining it ELIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7aem7/eli5_dd_for_apes_with_crayon_drawings_no_amount/) *warning: this is originally from early February (I deleted OP during the migration but was requested to repost) and is reflected in some of the terminology and information we knew at the time. Remember this was written looong before Superstonk!*

&#x200B;

It appears the media is beginning to craft a narrative around a market collapse. It will be interesting to see how it's written.

# !powerup! 🎮 Power to the Players 🛑 flair

We had a lot of fun debuting the new flair on Friday and turning everything from the sub to our twitters to match Gamestop's sleek new colors! We wanted to capture the excitement of the new branding campaign seen across Gamestop's socials, and it really took off! We even got a fun 4th of July tweet from the man RC himself, which I choose to believe was his way of taking part of the 4th of July Flair Friday Fun.

Please remember apes, as you are interacting with Gamestop Social Media, that their objective is to reach gamers and promote their brand to their demographic. Yes it's fun when they tweet MOASS and Chickie Tendies, but let's not flood them with comments about Ken, Naked Short Selling, and Mayonnaise. Let's show them support by joining, contributing to, and expanding their robust community of gamers!
