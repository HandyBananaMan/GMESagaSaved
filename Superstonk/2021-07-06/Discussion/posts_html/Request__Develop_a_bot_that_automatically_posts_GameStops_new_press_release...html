<p>Boom. No more need for 378 smooth brains to post the same bit of information!</p>
<p>The post would stay pinned until a mod removes it manually or another press release is posted.</p>
<p>Apart from violating the rules, the amount of mass-shared content of official corporate news in the form of links to secondary sources, screenshots, and other redundant ways of trying to farm some karma by ‚Äúbeing the first to post the news‚Äù has become inacceptable and difficult for mods to control.</p>
<p>I would do it myself but I can't code at all.</p>
<p>Any volunteers and further suggestions, name ideas?? üôÇ</p>
