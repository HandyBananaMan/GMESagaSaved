    "selftext": "tl;dr:  FUD and shilling doesn't need to wear us out and divide us if we're doing it to ourselves.\n\nToday is July 6.  We're 1-5 days past tHe AnOuNceMenT!! that never came.  We're 2 days divorced from the Prophecy of the Cryptic Tweets.  We're two weeks past the busted T+21 cycle (which has since likely been explained away with the stock offering.)  And we're all ginned up for the *cup & handle*, the *bull pennant*, and the many other signs that are overlapping that strongly suggest action will happen within the next week or two.\n\nBut like many Apes I personally know, and many of our more sensible number here, we're *tired*.  We're not tired of money. We're not tired of waiting.  We're tired of being irrationally hyped up every day being told that payoff is imminent.\n\nImpatience isn't killing us, it's being told day-in, day-out, with countless SCREAMING MEMES and hYpE ViDEos telling us we're special, and the tin-foil analyses of tweets and gifs and what-not  that *we don't need patience.*\n\nAnd guess what?  You need patience.  You need a lot of it.  Remember: Burry knew *exactly when* the housing market was going to crash... and it still clung to life for months.\n\nInstead of hyping dates, we need to hype the patience needed to reach the inevitable endgame.   BUY and HODL is all that should be hyped.  **FUD should be fought at every turn, but with fact versus screaming enthusiasm.**\n\nWe are in a war.  A war against cheating.  A war against victimizing the lower classes.  A war for our financial independence.  A war to redistribute wealth.  A war for the chance to have the resources to make meaningful change in society.  A war to level the playing field and make the market more fair and meritorious in the future.\n\nBut guess what?  Elan doesn't win wars.  The French 100 years ago can tell you this.  Enthusiasm and and an exceptional spirit doesn't win the day.  If you fight a war, you have to show up prepared.  This is how you come prepared to this war:\n\n- You read and understand the DDs.\n- You steel yourself against the enemy's attempts to FUD you into submission.\n- You take comfort with your compatriots, and rely on them to bolster you when you doubt your purpose.\n- You expect the war to last until your enemy surrenders.  **There is no \"the war is over tomorrow\"-thinking.**  You don't get to dictate the enemy's timetable.  You need to tell yourself \"I'll fight today; I'll fight harder tomorrow; and I'll fight until the enemy surrenders.\"\n\nThe hype and the irrationality of hunting for cryptic messages in tweets and crap that is now dominating this sub is like feeding your soldiers amphetamines: you've got them wound up right now, but they'll crash hard and suffer withdrawals in the future.  And at the rate we're going, that future will happen *before* MOASS.\n\nYou're risking turning off a large chunk of the community by jumping around and whooping like monkeys instead of being calm, cool and observant like apes.  Instead of wading through a pool of smooth brains trying to get wrinkles, discussing DDs or possible DDs, or laughing at the sarcasm and wit of a clever meme, we're we're more often needing to cover our ears from the screeching of people excitedly telling us how others are fucked and we're the best and WE SHOULD BE RICH ALREADY!!!\n\nJust stop.  Just calm down.  Just be patient.  And encourage others to be patient as well.  Explain the rationale.  Do some math. Read some math.  Read some theory.   Explain how BUY and HODL is the way and the only way.\n\nMOASS will arrive when it arrives.  There is NOTHING we can do to make it arrive any sooner.\n\nAnd while most/many of us wake up every day thinking today might be MOASS day, and if not tomorrow, I don't need to have 500,000 people telling me that I'm right... just for all of us to be wrong.\n\nIt's exhausting after so many times.  And while I doubt it will encourage anyone to sell their shares or change their belief, it *will* encourage them to stop participating in this community.  And that's a bad thing for many reasons and may ultimately still hurt the cause.",
