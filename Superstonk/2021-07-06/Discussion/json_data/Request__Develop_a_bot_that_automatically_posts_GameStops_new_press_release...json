No more need for 378 smooth brains to post the same bit of information!\n\nThe post would stay pinned until a mod removes it manually or another press release is posted.\n\nApart from violating the rules, the amount of mass-shared content of official corporate news in the form of links to secondary sources, screenshots, and other redundant ways of trying to farm some karma by \u201cbeing the first to post the news\u201d has become inacceptable and difficult for mods to control.\n\nI would do it myself but I can't code at all.\n\nAny volunteers and further suggestions, name ideas?? \ud83d\ude42",
