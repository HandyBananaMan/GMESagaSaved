    "selftext": "Here\u2019s why I think Ryan Cohen is about to take on Amazon with GameStop.\nIn an interview with Forbes, Ryan discusses how he turns down 99.9% of investments and that sometimes, the greatest thing you can do as an entrepreneur is simply be patient and wait for a great opportunity to come by.\nRyan Cohen also mentions how he took on Amazon with Chewy and exploited Amazons weakness in customer service and other areas to build his company.\nWith his success and chewy I think Ryan realized the customer service always wins with two gigantic warehouses and 5000 Stores across the US, Ryan Cohen can now sell all tech with same-day delivery plus 5000 stores retail can shop in , and go to for help. As far as I know Amazon does not have 5000 stores. How will they even compete?\n \nTL;DR- I think Amazon is fucked. Ryan Cohen figured out how to beat them, and will transform GameStop into the greatest tech company in the world. Laptops, tv screens, gaming computers, literally everything tech related. GameStop is looking to transition to one of the Biggest e-commerce companies in the world. And to think you were able to get in at such a low price \ud83d\ude05",
