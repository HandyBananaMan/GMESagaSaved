Boom. No more need for 378 smooth brains to post the same bit of information!

The post would stay pinned until a mod removes it manually or another press release is posted.

Apart from violating the rules, the amount of mass-shared content of official corporate news in the form of links to secondary sources, screenshots, and other redundant ways of trying to farm some karma by ‚Äúbeing the first to post the news‚Äù has become inacceptable and difficult for mods to control.

I would do it myself but I can't code at all.

Any volunteers and further suggestions, name ideas?? üôÇ

_EDIT:_ Wow, thanks everyone! I didn‚Äôt really expect this to take off like that!

An ape that is not yet approved by SATORI has already hit me up and wants to take up on the challenge. I advised them to get in touch with the mods as they eventually decide whether or not to implement such a news bot.

The bot however would probably not have to be coded completely from scratch, as GameStop also provides an RSS feed and I guess there are dozens of RSS bots available for Reddit, hopefully with a "pin this shit" feature. Sorry, I had totally forgotten about that feed. So maybe this could be implemented easily.

Several apes also mentioned to check out the customizable email alerts that GameStop provides, so I strongly recommend you subscribe and never miss an SEC filing or business update from RC and the gang again!

An auto-generated news post serves two functions:
1) It pulls the rug from those redundant "I saw it first!" posts, reducing or even preventing this kind of spam completely
2) It consolidates the discussion to one post, making it more inviting to exchange opinions on the topic.
