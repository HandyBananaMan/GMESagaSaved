When I was hired I was told I would have a raise at a certain time in the year. He mentioned it again a few times as a motivator I suppose. Anyways I get into the meeting and when I get a chance I ask for it. I was denied, some bullshit runaround about not enough money in the company. Although just before was bragging about this big new job and how they went way over last years sales by a huge amount. Not to mention the brand new boat he just bought. 

Then he gets all pissed and throws up this .jpeg of the bathroom at work on the projector and started pointing to the hand soap container was on the ground. So instead of picking it up after it was knocked off the sink, he stopped took a photo and got the projector ready for it. All while leaving it on the floor. And the kicker is I didn’t even use this washroom as it was in the office and I work in the shop.

I begged my body not to do it. I clenched my first, bit my tongue...

I started laughing. Hard. Like fuck it was bad. I might actually get fired over it. He was pissed as hell. I couldn’t stop laughing for longer then I’d like to admit, even was trying to hide the chuckles on the way out of the office. No way I’m going to be a slave to the grind for this type of people ever again after this. 

Lol good thing I’m not here for much longer.
