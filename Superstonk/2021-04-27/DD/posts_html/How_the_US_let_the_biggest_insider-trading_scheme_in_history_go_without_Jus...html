<p>I've recently gotten into writing DD ( all in chronological order at bottom ) and have begun delving deep into a certain hedge fund manager, Steve Cohen. 3 out of my last 4 DD have involved him. I've continued looking into his connections and here's what I've found today.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/lcop9g0xgrv61.jpg?width=1520&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1dedfe30bcc66402dffb75012809a8cbbfea80c7">Indicted</a></p>
<p>Background for people who haven't read the previous DD. Steven Cohen was involved with insider trading at his old hedge fund, SAC. A bunch of people were indicted and the hedge fund itself got shut down. Steve was banned from the industry until 2018. </p>

<p>Gabe Plotkin, Melvin's founder and boss, was also working for Steve at SAC. He was also getting insider information from Steinberg (screenshot above) like Cohen was, but faced no major punishment. You can dive deeper into all that with my past DD, this is a new one. </p>

<p>The FBI had been working on a massive investigation that had over 70 arrests so far. They were calling the SAC insider trading scandal "the biggest insider-trading scheme in history." Everything was looking good so far, rooting out insider trading by setting an example here. <a href="https://www.investmentnews.com/senior-manager-at-sac-capital-indicted-for-fraud-50572">Source for screenshots above</a></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/e34mqmouirv61.jpg?width=1126&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=049c722103fd4db6df6a49ce81961ea85b854ed0">Well we knew</a></p>
<p>Yeah, Cohen got away as we all know. We also know that Plotkin was the same. </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/0lsgd46mjrv61.jpg?width=1111&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ce66d683b873b8d7978a6e3433125283ca6481d">Prosecutors withholding evidence</a></p>
<p>The prosecutors had asked that evidence which showed Plotkin and Cohen both making trades based on Insider information be barred from use in the case. They said that didn't the jury to be confused. Why you ask?</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/y75yihc6krv61.jpg?width=1143&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5271574ffecc27c8b5e67e5790774df4e5743412">Reason </a></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8z5yi8d7krv61.jpg?width=1031&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1af72cc66079ffd2c16f96e852a159a8806b26a0">reason</a></p>
<p>They claimed that no solid evidence linked Cohen and Plotkin to the insider information directly. They made trades based on the info, but they received it from Steinberg, who was indicted. Maybe Steinberg never told them what his source was, maybe he did, we don't know do we?</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/u2uk0w9okrv61.jpg?width=1089&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2330c174e03a7d80b90675d2d2a58f9aeca067ad">No charges here</a></p>
<p>The FBI continued, but could find nothing. Well surely if THEY couldn't do it, it just wasn't possible and we can't blame them....</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/uh1v384enrv61.jpg?width=1082&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a52df6097622b985637d972bfea3cee0e3db1b82">Unaware</a></p>
<p>Plotkin was the apparent point at which it all fell apart. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/sac-plea-hedge/in-sac-case-one-chain-of-insider-tips-reached-a-dead-end-before-cohen-idUSL2N0IT14X20131108">source for above screenshots</a></p>
<p>If only they could prove he was aware of it all... I won't act like I know better than the actual criminal investigators. At least they were able to get some of the guys involved, right? right..? Well, there's a reason I've only mentioned Steinberg being <em>indicted</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/x5z5j6k7orv61.jpg?width=1117&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b245f7d4449ab6f9be4f686a887dff7707cc5dfd">Never brought to justice</a></p>
<p>Steinberg was convicted back in 2013, but appealed it until the U.S. courts ruled in his favor and interpreted the law in a way that meant he never broke it.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/0ecknd5norv61.jpg?width=1091&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4491ae9f4194b8e9ad1bdf25da0851824044dad4">14 people </a></p>
<p>At least 14 people were able to get away from what was supposed to be an investigation which rooted out hedge fund insider trading. This major "crackdown" has been underway since SAC's indictment but now will probably be unable to accomplish its goal thanks to the court. </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/h5tbifo8prv61.jpg?width=1138&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65b893962d9aa86e108255f8f024cbf4f7fa3e3">result of the ruling</a></p>
<p>As long as the insider trading does not fall under the narrow definition, it won't even be insider trading in the law's eyes. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-insidertrading/u-s-abandons-insider-trading-case-against-sacs-steinberg-idUSKCN0SG2JZ20151022">Source for above screenshots</a></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/5t5xvrzkrrv61.jpg?width=1573&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab28fd1620c6c9e306c9da4c7dc86446d6decb31">endless cycle</a></p>
<p>And he just goes back to doing what he's always been. Except this time, he's in charge of his own hedge fund. </p>
<p>This isn't just the story of how a bunch of criminals ran an elaborate scheme and were able to handle it well enough to get away. This is about how the government, law enforcement, and judiciary allowed it to happen. They let them get away. They let them continue what they've always done.</p>
