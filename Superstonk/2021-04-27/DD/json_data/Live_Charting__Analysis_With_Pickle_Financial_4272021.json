    "selftext": "Hello APES!\n\nGood morning! It's Me, Gherkinit, bring you another day of crayons and tea leaves.\n\nSo some good news on the GME front we sold 3.5 million Shares at a cost average of $157. Guess this means the new value of GME's post-squeeze minimum is $157 , sorry to all the shorts who have a cost basis below this number. You might get margin called.\n\nWe had an amazing climb out of the poke-ball resistance zone yesterday and are looking for new highs today as long whales scramble to pick up GME nice and cheap before it moons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs this bullish? You tell me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yk5kfuwpnpv61.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95bc84bb6e0ee869fcd20bccad73a5e193c0bcf\n\nWe had an Awesome Day on stream yesterday and thank you for everyone's support once again.\n\nWe will be live again today [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vu7j6xxf9uw) if you have a chance come by and check it out .\n\nHistorical Resistance/Support:\n\n116.5, 125.5, 132.5, 141, 145, 147.5, **150**, 152.5, 156.5, 158.5, 162.5, 163, 165.5, 172, 174, 176.5, 179, 180.5, 182, 183.5, 184.5, 186, 187.5, 190.5, 192, 195, 196.5, 197.5, **200**, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, 226, 230, 234, 243, 250, 253, 256\n\n*This Post will read from top to bottom, any images over 20 will be deleted as the day progresses.*\n\n**Questions are always welcome I will reply down in the comments as often as I can**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# After Market Analysis\n\nThese are our closing Stats for the day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lardcdkqvrv61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=15904caba9040d4ce084844e581fb0de2a81df68\n\nOverall I think we had a good day up 5.37 percent and up day is a win against the bear side. Not very much volume in the latter half of the day. Looking for moves upwards of that 180 resistance we got stuck on today moving into the 185-200 channel in the pre-market or tomorrow will put us in a strong position. \n\nI'm  so sorry for the automod issues that occurred earlier today I do not know if it was server side or reddit but I tried to keep you all updated. If you need up to date information and are unable to watch on YouTube during any reddit outages, our discord has a live audio stream. I just want to provide other options for anybody looking as reddit has been known to not handle high traffic moments well.\n\nThank you all again for you support, awards, and help. All of you are really making this whole thing feel very worthwhile and I love the Company! \n\nThank you again and see you tomorrow,\n\ngherkinit\n\nEdit 15 3:55\n\nLooks like were just gonna close at 178-180\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sp5syc4ztrv61.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd511227c55fce6fd754786472fe05020929f92f\n\nEdit 14 3:22\n\nPower hour is looking lackluster no volume and we can just end between 176-180\n\nEdit 13 2:52\n\nStill sideways not a lot happening. You guys know the deal no volume = no fun.\n\nEdit 12 2:09\n\nSo sorry the automod got me for having sub 500 karma...\n\nI posted some updates in the comments to keep it alive. We are trading sideways slightly upward on very low volume into power hour. I missed you all. Testing 180 on low volume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z472cqbfbrv61.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=454b0b269973c8962ca29204c40b690ace37453b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 9 12:07\n\nMore chop and sideways action you can join the discord [here](https://discord.gg/HbqnUVsSrH) for live audio or look at my pinned posts to follow along\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmrboktspqv61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=790491c80b9256e3df7e0272133abbffb247d979\n\nEdit 8 11:00\n\nHead and shoulders forming sloppy but that's what I'm gonna call. Might see a small dip to the 175 resistance\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5tfnu2rjdqv61.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c611d1e3f8d124ce3a36d0b0f3d9205aa64e700\n\nEdit 7 10:47\n\nMore chopping\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5t4zoj81bqv61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=791d130d91cd44d7ddb9cdaadf5855ae8a6403c7\n\nEdit 6 10:31\n\nVolume picking up as we push through VWAP, nice uptrend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjhov1588qv61.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=bec9c111eadbe8bf00278b268750d5cd5bc78ef1\n\nEdit 5 10:17\n\nFighting for 180 chop volume is down right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtlqb5as5qv61.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=a35b5d692dd456ec0fd4824d383a4b01d5e45067\n\nEdit 4 9:58\n\nMorning dip could happen if we continue to breakdown from this 180 support\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuq3wz6j2qv61.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=783cc5489d66e1c6743a519835143f8280cc42ff\n\nEdit 3 9:46\n\nDropping below support at 180 could lead to a nice sale\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45aswz870qv61.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=2522addf32a90c088b6dfb961ae06056430603af\n\n**Edit 2 9:42**\n\nLooking like we are gonna chop a bit at VWAP\n\n**Edit 1 9:35**\n\nExcellent open volume 1MM in the first five minutes short and long pressure were about equal,turning around to the upside as long pressure wins out\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/js1y2r2kypv61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=181f6270d532ff0479115e6137e8bfebbc8e5fa3\n\n# Pre-Market Analysis\n\nPre-Edit 9:29\n\n175k Volume slow but I think it will pick up\n\nPre-Edit 2 9:20\n\nLooking good volume picking up crossed to the upside of VWAP going into the opening bell\n\nLook at this Big Beautiful Breakout.\n\n[BBB](https://preview.redd.it/u37qwkysnpv61.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=f95d4adb198992382efe396a91fdd09f0ca3b154)\n\nPre-Edit 1 8:30\n\nWe are sitting comfortably @ 184.39 up 8.97% since closing bell. Normally on a slow day I would expect to gap-fill before climbing but I think we are going to just rocket as long whales scramble to buy more shares at a discount (More on this as volume picks up around 9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rd030kernpv61.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=73624d3229d7cfc5340a53d0dbb0f0035e9a3318\n\n*This is not Financial advice.
