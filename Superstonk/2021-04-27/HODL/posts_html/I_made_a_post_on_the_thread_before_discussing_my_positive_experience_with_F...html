<h1>Title: I made a post on the thread before discussing my positive experience with Fidelity. I just spoke with a rep from there and he said 8-10 million robinhood users have switched to Fidelity 🤯 we definitely own the float</h1>

<p>Basically I was inquiring on voting procedures and whether my shares had been converted to cash. After he informed me of my details I asked him if Fidelity planned to update their UI in response to all us new poop slingers joining Fidelity. 
He went onto explain how fidelity has seen a migration of 8-10 million robinhood users with Fidelity having 80 million customers to satisfy prior. He then went on to say that Fidelity focuses on quality over quantity as I mouthed out “holy shit” at the prospect of 10 new million robin hood users on Fidelity. </p>
<p>Let’s be super conservative and assume 6 million of these 8-10million new users hold GME. 
Let’s now say there is an average of 5 shares between 6 million people - that is 30 million shares of GME on ONE BROKER ALONE.<br />
(Cough cough there are many other brokers with many gme holders)</p>
<p>After asking about my control number he also told me to check back next week as there are unprecedented amount of shares to locate for this process. 
Smooth brain 🦍 out 
HODL ME</p>
<p>EDIT: He also told me to call GameStop? And or check their website for details regarding your vote so keep your eyes peeled, don’t click on any links anyone sends you, and be dope to one another.</p>
<p>For those saying show me proof - I welcome your healthy skepticism, but as this was a phone call I I wasn’t expecting to happen I did not record the call. Only way to investigate is if more apes inquire from other reps. If The fidelity rep told me these figures then I’m assuming other reps should say the same. But in any case I’m not the one providing the numbers I just came here when I heard them. 
It’s important to address all claims that come through though so no harm no foul 💪🏾</p>
<p>Thank you for all the awards you beautiful apes, I only shared this interaction because I believed it would confirm our bias so hard as we deserve 🙌🏽💎 
Love to see the love and sharing of information</p>
