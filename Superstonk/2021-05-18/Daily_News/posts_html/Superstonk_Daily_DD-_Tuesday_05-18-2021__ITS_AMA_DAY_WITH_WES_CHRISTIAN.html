<h1>Y'all ready for another AMA?!</h1>
<p><em>Written by</em> u/pinkcatsonacid 🦄</p>
<h1><a href="http://www.csj-law.com/attorneys/jchristian.html">Today at 4:30 pm eastern we have Attorney Wes Christian</a>!!</h1>
<h1>His primary focus in the last 11 years has been suing Wall Street for fraud.</h1>
<p>Wes Christian is a Texas attorney with <a href="http://www.csj-law.com/attorneys/jchristian.html">an accent as big as his list of accomplishments</a>!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/l8sw44levsz61.png?width=170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30566ca147a7bf7d97992cfadde50a766f0526ac">Wes Christian</a></p>
<p>Once again I'm going to <a href="https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU">shamelessly plug the old documentary Wall Street Conspiracy</a>, where I first learned of Wes Christian along with all of the other OGs we've been talking to. And a fun fact... our former AMA guest and very favorite resident wrinkly brain, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/dlauer/">u/dlauer</a> has served as an expert witness for Wes multiple times in the fight against naked short selling. They go way back...</p>
<h1>Which is why we're having <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Dlauer/">u/Dlauer</a> cohost* this AMA with his old pal Wes!! We are literally assembling the dream team here!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</h1>
<p><strong>*the AMA will be curated and hosted by</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Jsmar18/">u/Jsmar18</a></p>
<p><strong>Here's what Dr. T has to say about how she first met Wes in her book, Naked Short and Greedy:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Chapter 3: A Sidewalk Café in New York. At the request of a business colleague, I have coffee with a lawyer from Texas who tells me that a problem was about to blow up the financial markets: Wall Street brokers are using short sales and fails to deliver to grab the assets of American entrepreneurs. I feel a pang of guilt for not sticking it out to fix this before I left DTC in 1993. By 2003, it was a full-blown regulatory crisis!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>The Napkin Story</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"One afternoon [in late 2003], my boss tells me he has just come from lunch with an old friend, Gary Jewell, a Houston-based lawyer. Gary said that he was in New York looking for someone who understands post-trade clearing and settlement, possibly someone who may have worked at the DTC. My boss recognizes the company name as part of my past work experience. He asks me to meet Gary over coffee. The two of them had run marathons in their younger days and my boss presents it to me as doing him a favor. Gary brought Wes Christian to that casual meeting.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>James "Wes" Christian, is a Senior Partner at Christian, Smith, &amp; Jewell in Houston. If not for Wes, I may not ever have become aware that the crack in the system Ray Riley brought to me in 1993 was becoming a gaping chasm in 2003. Wes was born, raised, and educated in Texas. He comes complete with a pleasant drawl that belies his non-nonsense approach to the matter. Wes would lead a team of 65 lawyers as he eventually uncovered more than 1,200 hedge fund and offshore accounts working through more than 150 broker-dealers to strip mall and medium size public companies of their value."- Dr. Susanne Trimbath, Naked Short and Greedy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We are so honored, humbled, and thrilled to bring you these top-tier AMA guests! If only we could go back and tell our February selves how far we've come 💖</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Tune in today at 4:30 pm Eastern for the Wes Christian/Dave Lauer/Jsmar AMA mashup panel that is sure to wrinkle some brains and blow some minds!</strong></p>

<h1>Glacier Capital</h1>
<p>Written by u/Rensole</p>
<p>Glacier capital does not exist, or at least that was the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nezcn1/glacier_capital_does_not_exist/">post</a> made yesterday written by u/timmmmmmmyy </p>
<p>One of the main points was that on their adres ( 44 Boulevard de Verdun, L-2670 Luxembourg ) there was no legal entity but after a quick search with google I found them registered at the adres</p>
<p><a href="https://opendatalei.com/lei/984500BB91F55397AC42">https://opendatalei.com/lei/984500BB91F55397AC42</a></p>
<p>Now this may look weird as hell to be using as a hedgefund right? well no not really.</p>
<p>Something a lot of people may not know is that in Europe "mailbox businesses" are fairly commonplace, this means that they have an address anywhere within europe for tax reasons (this is mostly seen in Curacao, Luxembourg and other tax haven countries).</p>
<p>u/Bud_Friendguy even did a great response (which unfortunately got caught by automod and should be back up in that thread), he reverse image searched and found out that the images don't match up with the names, so all in all the company may be a real company, or a subsidiary of a bigger company located in Luxembourg.</p>

<h1>SEC is Slinging Dough (if you make that whistle blow)</h1>
<p><em>Written by</em> u/pinkcatsonacid 🦄</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/6sfeqxvmksz61.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4948233659d352fa2a50005d8287d1f14f3ebe23">2 different whistle blowers got PAID</a></p>
<p><em>"In the first order, the SEC awarded almost $27 million to two claimants who provided SEC staff with new information and assistance during an existing investigation, including meeting with the staff in person on multiple days.  Their information and cooperation helped the Commission bring the enforcement action, which resulted in the return of millions of dollars to harmed investors.</em></p>
<p><em>In the second order, the SEC awarded one whistleblower an award of approximately $3.75 million and the other whistleblower an award of approximately $750,000.  While both whistleblowers independently provided information that assisted SEC staff in an ongoing investigation, the whistleblower who received the larger award provided information and assistance that was more important to the resolution of the overall case.</em>"- <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-85">source</a> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So it looks like the SEC has yet again awarded several lifetime supplies of cash to a few whistle blowers. This time it looks like it's been split up between 3 different people, 1 getting a HUGE FREAKING PAYOUT OF $27,000,000! How tf can there be this much corruption going on right now, that it's worth THAT much money, yet we know nothing about it, and probably never will? I'm starting to think the whistle blower program is probably a money laundering scheme too, at this point...</p>

<h1>GME Back to Largest short value and hardest to borrow</h1>

<h1>FINTEL 13-F FILING/SHORT UPDATE</h1>
<p>written by u/rensole</p>
<p>A thread got posted by u/Mikeymikers0n <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ner3cx/fintel_13f_filingshort_update_welcome_to_the/">here</a></p>

<p>Seems that our friends over at Citadel have almost doubled their bet against us, let's do it kenny, I'll call your bluff.</p>
<p>The one thing that did caught my eye is that Melvin is no longer on this list (maybe it still needs to be updated?), but it could also be possible they have "closed" their positions, or shifted it in long otm options, or even shifted to another subsidiary of theirs. it's just something interesting imo and we should/could look into this.</p>
<p>As the DTCC said they didn't force anyone to close their positions in January it's very interesting to find out were they all went.</p>

<h1>I love you, but I don't like you</h1>
<p>Written by u/Rensole</p>
<p>This was tweeted yesterday by the man with the plan RC yesterday.</p>
<p>It seems that others have found that its a reference to the song  </p>
<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdDnqSFYXFs&amp;ab_channel=latacabre1">Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles - You Really Got A Hold On Me</a></h1>
<p>-----&gt; <strong>I don't like you, but I love you</strong><br />
Seems that I'm always thinking of you<br />
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly<br />
I love you madly, you really got a HOLD on me<br />
You really got a <strong>HOLD</strong> on me,<br />
you really got a <strong>HOLD</strong> on me,<br />
you really got a <strong>HOLD</strong> , baby<br />
I don't want you, but I need you<br />
Don't want to kiss you, but I need you<br />
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now<br />
My love is strong now you really got a <strong>HOLD</strong> on me<br />
You really got a <strong>hold</strong> on me,<br />
you really got a <strong>hold</strong> on me,<br />
you really got a <strong>hold</strong>, baby<br />
I love you and all I want you to do is just <strong>hold</strong> me<br />
<strong>HOLD</strong> me, <strong>HOLD</strong> me, <strong>HOLD</strong> me</p>
<p>Tighter<br />
Tighter<br />
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here<br />
Don't want to spend another day here<br />
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now, I can't quit now<br />
You really got a hold on me, you really got a hold on me, you really got a <strong>hold</strong>, baby<br />
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me, please<br />
-----&gt; <strong>Hold me, SQUEEZE, HOLD me, HOLD me</strong><br />
-----&gt; <strong>You really got a HOLD on me</strong><br />
-----&gt; <strong>You really got a HOLD on me</strong><br />
-----&gt; <strong>I said you really got a HOLD on me</strong></p>
<p>Again this could be fully coincidental and his granny just really loves this song, but on the other hand it seems like a reference like usual, and just like the "MOASS Tweet" it was "sent from Iphone" while the rest on the official GME twitter was sent by their salesforce.</p>
<p>Could be something, could be nothing.</p>

<p>Mods have carefully considered what to do during a reddit blackout and advise the following - IF REDDIT GOES DOWN AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT go to the team's socials to look for additional instructions on where to muster (these are the most active twitter accounts on the mod team at this time!). And check in on SuperStonk's YouTube Channel for an Emergency Broadcast, if necessary.</p>
