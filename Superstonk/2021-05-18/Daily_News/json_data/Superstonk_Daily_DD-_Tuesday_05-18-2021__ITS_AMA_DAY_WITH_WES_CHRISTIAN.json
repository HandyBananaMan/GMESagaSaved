And a fun fact... our former AMA guest and very favorite resident wrinkly brain, [u/dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/u/dlauer/) has served as an expert witness for Wes multiple times in the fight against naked short selling. They go way back...\n\n# Which is why we're having [u/Dlauer](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dlauer/) cohost* this AMA with his old pal Wes!!

At the request of a business colleague, I have coffee with a lawyer from Texas who tells me that a problem was about to blow up the financial markets: Wall Street brokers are using short sales and fails to deliver to grab the assets of American entrepreneurs. I feel a pang of guilt for not sticking it out to fix this before I left DTC in 1993. By 2003, it was a full-blown regulatory crisis!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Napkin Story\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"One afternoon \\[in late 2003\\], my boss tells me he has just come from lunch with an old friend, Gary Jewell, a Houston-based lawyer. Gary said that he was in New York looking for someone who understands post-trade clearing and settlement, possibly someone who may have worked at the DTC. My boss recognizes the company name as part of my past work experience. He asks me to meet Gary over coffee. The two of them had run marathons in their younger days and my boss presents it to me as doing him a favor. Gary brought Wes Christian to that casual meeting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJames \"Wes\" Christian, is a Senior Partner at Christian, Smith, & Jewell in Houston. If not for Wes, I may not ever have become aware that the crack in the system Ray Riley brought to me in 1993 was becoming a gaping chasm in 2003. Wes was born, raised, and educated in Texas. He comes complete with a pleasant drawl that belies his non-nonsense approach to the matter. Wes would lead a team of 65 lawyers as he eventually uncovered more than 1,200 hedge fund and offshore accounts working through more than 150 broker-dealers to strip mall and medium size public companies of their value.\"- Dr. Susanne Trimbath, Naked Short and Greedy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are so honored, humbled, and thrilled to bring you these top-tier AMA guests! If only we could go back and tell our February selves how far we've come \ud83d\udc96\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tune in today at 4:30 pm Eastern for the Wes Christian/Dave Lauer/Jsmar AMA mashup panel that is sure to wrinkle some brains and blow some minds!**\n\n# [Link to Superstonk Live YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rJujnpKiqM)!\n\n[**Here's a countdown timer!**](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=179&iso=20210518T1630&year=2021&month=5&day=18&hour=16&min=30&sec=0&msg=Countdown%20Timer)\n\n# Past AMA Transcripts\n\n**Huge shoutout to** u/Bye_Triangle**,** u/Leaglese**,** u/Cuttingwater_**, and** u/Luridess **for their work on these bad boys!

This time it looks like it's been split up between 3 different people, 1 getting a HUGE FREAKING PAYOUT OF $27,000,000! How tf can there be this much corruption going on right now, that it's worth THAT much money, yet we know nothing about it, and probably never will? I'm starting to think the whistle blower program is probably a money laundering scheme too, at this point...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nlksgbvt5tz61.jpg?width=840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18bf115b8e10e0ca0960d15c877f93201e373480\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# GME Back to Largest short value and hardest to borrow\n\nWritten By u/rensole\n\nThe thread is fairly self explanatory so give it a quick read\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nel0dg/gamestop\\_ibkr\\_slb\\_report\\_update\\_asof\\_514\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nel0dg/gamestop_ibkr_slb_report_update_asof_514_gme/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cx6lufabiuz61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=1be946b2e86ab61400988077d8894e07fdad96fa\n\n  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  FINTEL 13-F FILING/SHORT UPDATE \n\n written by u/rensole\n\nA thread got posted by u/Mikeymikers0n [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ner3cx/fintel_13f_filingshort_update_welcome_to_the/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhsf5sa6huz61.png?width=3698&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f2d9db67c2c2fb3e12f4d29a973c6a0fbedcc7\n\nSeems that our friends over at Citadel have almost doubled their bet against us, let's do it kenny, I'll call your bluff.\n\nThe one thing that did caught my eye is that Melvin is no longer on this list (maybe it still needs to be updated?), but it could also be possible they have \"closed\" their positions, or shifted it in long otm options, or even shifted to another subsidiary of theirs. it's just something interesting imo and we should/could look into this.\n\nAs the DTCC said they didn't force anyone to close their positions in January it's very interesting to find out were they all went.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6dw5wheiuz61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f48684af767568bfe811d73472640d1b57977c2\n\n# I love you, but I don't like you\n\nWritten by u/Rensole\n\nThis was tweeted yesterday by the man with the plan RC yesterday.\n\nIt seems that others have found that its a reference to the song  \n\n# [Smokey Robinson & The Miracles -
