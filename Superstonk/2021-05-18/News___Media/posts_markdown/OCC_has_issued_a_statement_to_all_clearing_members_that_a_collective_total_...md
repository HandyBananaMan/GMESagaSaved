# Title: OCC has issued a statement to all clearing members that a collective total of $588,378,155 will need to be deposited as a temporary increase to the size of the clearing fund until June 1st. Deposits must be made from each member by 05/19/21. I'm assuming liquidity test didn't go so well recently.
