<p>On page 6 of  SR-ICC-2021-005 (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91806.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/icc/2021/34-91806.pdf</a>), one of the recovery tools/actions ICC can use is :</p>
<p>--Partial  tear-up of remaining  positions  (ICC Rules  20-605(f)(iii)  and  809)  where ICC terminates  positions  of non-defaulting  CPs that exactly offset those in the defaulter’s remaining  portfolio;  and </p>
<p>--Reduced gains distributions  (“RGD”) (ICC Rule 808) for up to five consecutive business days,  allowing  ICC to reduce payment  of variation,  or mark-to-market,  gains  that would otherwise  be owed to  CPs, as ICC attempts  a secondary  auction  or conducts  a partialtear-up. </p>
<p>What this clause is saying is that if the defaulting member has positions like say short GME, any non-defaulting member who has an offsetting position (in this case long GME) would have that offsetting position terminated. </p>
<p>The question is how does the ICC define the term "terminating" a position. Do they force the non-defaulting member to sell their offsetting position? Is the offsetting position taken away from the non-defaulting member and just used outright to cancel the position the defaulter passed to ICC members? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In options, when an option is terminated it means the buyer is legally allowed to cancel an executed trade. I just don't know how "terminate" would be defined in this case. Anyone care to chime in?</p>
