<p>First of all, thank you to all of the mods, Dave Lauer, and Wes Christian for putting on this AMA.  It was so enlightening and really gave a lot of hope for some justice coming in the near future.  I absolutely can not wait for round 2 AMA with Wes.</p>
<p>GME announced they had completed their at-the-market equity offering on April 26th, 2021, to the tune of 3,500,000 shares sold for proceeds of $551,000,000.  The program had been approved for raising up to $1 billion.</p>
<p>Assuming the voted shares count ultimately shows 200% of the float voted, (do any of you really believe it will be that low?  What could it be, 300%? 400%?  Higher??) then it should be fairly simple to argue the share price, on the date of the equity offering, should be higher at a multiple equal to or greater than the multiple of shares over voted.  This should easily satisfy the minimum requirement of $100 million in losses for a lawsuit against the market manipulators on behalf of a law firm such as Christian Smith &amp; Jewell.</p>
<p>Exciting, indeed!  Here's to RC and crew pursuing this to the fullest!</p>
<p>Edit:  Thank you for the awards, and obligatory 💎👐🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕</p>
