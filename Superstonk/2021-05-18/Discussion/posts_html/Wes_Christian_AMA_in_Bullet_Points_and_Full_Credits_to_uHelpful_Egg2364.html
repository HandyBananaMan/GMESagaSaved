<p>All notes directly from u/Helpful_Egg2364. Thank you fellow ape for allowing me to post this!  Their account is not old enough to post here.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>AMA: "reported SI is <em>garbage</em>"</p>
<p>AMA - He believes there are 2 sets of books "like ENRON"</p>
<ol>
<li>through DTCC - audit trail</li>
<li>ex-clearing - broker to broker outside the SEC</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything is Fake News in the financial sector - the system is rigged</p>
<p>- From AMA - horses mouth
-AMA: Bona Fide Market Makers - They have no actual affirmative obligations - just the privileges (from what I understand)</p>
<p>AMA: Bona Fide Market Makers and Prime Brokers are center stage in the rigging of the system</p>
<p>- He speculates that this began in late 90's early 00's when DTCC purchased the NSEC (loan stock).</p>
<p>- Proprietary trading became the main business of prime brokers as opposed to IPO's and wealth management</p>
<p>- Proprietary trading in stock lending is really just "driving the company into the ground" as a business model-  We're finding that we are rarely wrong about our assessment of the system. We may be wrong about specific moves and dates but rarely about how it all comes together.---</p>
<p>- Confirming that the DTC is a self regulating body which was a good idea turned into a monster due to lack of enforcement. Electronic delivery is environment ripe for fraud.</p>
<p>- Require that stocks be delivered: This is lying, cheating, and stealing!</p>
<p>- He has never gone to trial on these cases because they typically settle to avoid airing dirty laundry.</p>
<p>- No lending shares more than once!</p>
<p>- Creating artificial supply undermines the entire mechanism of the stock market</p>
<p>- He has helped clients fight for a year to get their 10's of millions of shares.</p>
<p>- They are working on tools to identify when you are being delivered actual shares or counterfeit shares</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>This is the same thing as a car owner xeroxing their car title and selling the same title 100 times. In that case they would be in jail but this is the <em>Cabal</em></p>
<p>DL: "too big to jail"</p>
<p>AMA: they are preparing a major bench case!</p>
<p>- He is doing this for the principle</p>
<p>- Takes a gargantuan effort - "GOTTA BE STRONG AS APES"</p>
<p>- He likes us calling ourselves apes</p>
<p>AMA: Good lawyers representing crooks.</p>
<p>-"do we want to be on the side of right or the side of wrong." To be on the side of truth "or those who lie cheat and steal"</p>
<p>- Their team (which notably includes DAVE) is tackling this hardcore!!</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>DL: This is pretty much the first time this has gotten attention "AT THE TIME" of the short selling. The popular uprising is instrumental in making a difference in breaking this cabal's influence on the market</p>
<p>WC: "I think this has the best chance of being successful." Referring to GME breaking the power of this cabal</p>
<p>WC has successfully tackled stock manipulators, working with DOJ, FBI, etc. But the punishments for many of these cases are slaps on the wrists relatively speaking.</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>WC: It will take massive amounts of people to show the bullies HF + Prime brokers proprietary trading desks (make money by you buying, shorting against you, and lending your stock!).</p>
<p>- The "investing public" can share information and fight this behavior.</p>
<p>- Use cash accounts, monitor that they are not being lent, keep an eye on what your pension funds do, and other changes of behaviors.</p>
<p>- This behavior by Prime Brokers and HF is not right, illegal, and impacts the bottom line of all investors.</p>
<p>AMA: Synthetic Shares and Failures : MECHANISMS</p>
<p>WC:</p>
<p>- only answers using publicly available shares</p>
<p>- they have been called rehypothecation, reverse conversions, etc. But he calls them popeye and whippy principle (give me the share and I will pay you next wednesday... which never comes)</p>
<p>- Results in dissemination of false info. Which they (proprietary trading desk) can show to their <strong>internal compliance office,</strong> who can show the <strong>regulators,</strong></p>
<p>- Naked short seller asks another broker who will sell him some shares <strong>which are marked long but are actually SHORT</strong></p>
<p>- Just strategies to buy them time so the compliance and regulators off their backs.</p>
<p>- Naked shorting is essentially a Futures contract to do something in some form of shares which NEVER GETS consummated</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>- I missed a bit to let my dog out.</p>
<p>- many of the trading platforms are just servers in a data centers (in NJ) making it easier to lie and harder to regulate</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>WC: has seen firms using Large ITM options trading hands as a means to spoof the market</p>
<p>- A lot of favors between brokerages. They will sell each other options contracts which will last 90 days and then 2 days before will tear it up</p>
<p>- u/Itz_Ape <em>explanation:</em>  A option seller can "neutralize" a sold option via buying it back. It looks like when time to "neutralize" sold options comes, they ask for a new option.  Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>- fails sometimes exist for years</p>
<p>- The mission of the bad people is to drive the price down so they can keep the cash</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>To be certified as a "class" for a class action suit, you have to be "in the same ball game with the same bat" all <strong>damaged</strong> in the same way.</p>
<p>Roundup example: All people were injured by the same company but were not a class because they were not injured in the same way (however changing because they are seeing that it leads to cancer (same damage))</p>
<p>AMA: Discovery process (GETTING INFO)</p>
<p>- Most cases have protective orders, so only parties (sometimes only the lawyers) can see them</p>
<p>- sometimes they get published by SEC or the parties on accident.</p>
<p>- They have ways to check public information with cross-sections of data but this often requires cooperation with the issuer</p>
<p>- Issuer contracts with DTC for certain services , such as a daily Position report to the issuer</p>
<p>- Daily position report will let you compare how the debits and credits are happening in comparison with what is happening in the market place</p>
<p>- Best way is for Issuer to contract with 3rd-party entity to "stock-track"</p>
<p>AMA: Synthetic Shares voting over 100%</p>
<p>- WC has seen this many times in many companies - SOMETIMES OVER 200%</p>
<p>- over half of the 60-70 companies he has worked with</p>
<p>- THIS DOESNT EVEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T VOTE AND THE PARTIES ENGAGED IN THE NAKED SHORTING</p>
<p>- he has brought this up to legislators and bureaucrats and they talk big but do nothing.</p>
<p>AMA: Impact of Synthetic shares</p>
<p>- Impairs corporate governance // company unable to carry out their basic functions</p>
<p>AMA: GME RECOURSE FOR OVER 100% SHARES</p>
<p>- GME CAN SUE the parties (Direct Claims)</p>
<p>- Shareholders can sue the parties (Derivative claims)</p>
<p>- Corporation owes fiduciary duty to shareholders, NOT SUING CAN BE A BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BY CORP.</p>
<p>- CORPS WHICH DO NOT SUE OFTEN TEND TO GO TO $0</p>
<p>AMA: CAN SHORTS OFFLOAD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS ONTO NON-DTCC PARTIES?</p>
<p>- No answer</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>- Dilution is a damage -is compensable to various extents.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>How helpful are Judges/DTCC when it comes to discovery?</p>
<p>WC: You are dealing with PEOPLE. Generally: Harder to get discovery from judges in NY. State Judges take more interest in it, Federal judges less.</p>
<p>- KEY: be extremely precise with your motions to compel (discovery motion) explain why each document you are requesting is relevant to the trial.</p>
<p>AMA:</p>
<p>WC has been in the cause for 20 years. And he will be part of this until it is resolved or he dies. This cause is extremely important -- has the country and global economy at risk.</p>
<p>He is open to do a part 2.</p>
