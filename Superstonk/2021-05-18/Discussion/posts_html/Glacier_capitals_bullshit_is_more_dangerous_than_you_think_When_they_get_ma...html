<p>Maybe too much Mayo memes have made us think that they’re too stupid (maybe too stupid). They’ll want to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>The Glacier Capital bullshit was too obvious. Maybe too obvious and good to be truth. Remember, even if they’ve done some dumb shit, this people is still very smart. </p>
<p>I think that they are using this strategy to have a MASSIVE opportunity to cover as much as possible. How? Incentivizing people to DAYTRADE. </p>
<p>It’s so obvious that if Glacier Capital was margin called, many apes would call out the bullshit and know it’s a fake short squeeze. Hedgies know this, and they also know that this would incentivize many apes to day trade.</p>
<p>This could be very dangerous because it would help them cover. </p>
<p>Patience Apes!! We just need to wait and found out how many votes there are to expose those mofos and fly to andromeda. Don’t bite the bait.</p>
