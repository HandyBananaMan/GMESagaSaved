\*\*UPDATE (not financial advice)\*\*: In case it was not clear, GME having a -21.6 beta does NOT mean that Spy down = GME up immediately. GME is not the Australian reflection of Spy. GME's high negative beta means that it correlates negatively to movements in Spy. It doesn't mean that this trend is observed for every hour or day of trading.

"Bbbbut GME is down big at open"..

1) might I remind you that this stock is highly manipulated? The shorts have untold billions of $ on the line and are not going down without a fight.. but what is a hedge fund to an army of strong sexy üíéü¶ç ?!?! If you have conviction in the MOASS thesis, then you know what to do :)

2) Don't forget that a lot of GME shares are contained in ETFs held by Vanguard, BlackRock, etc. If the market is going to shit, a decline in GME's price does NOT mean the ü¶ç's thesis is invalidated

3) These +/- 5% moves are tiny compared to what's to come when GME MOASS.. ü¶ç are mentally strong, even more so through this community.

"Bbbbbut GME's -21.6 beta is largely due to its movements in January & March"..

Yeah, so? The same factors that contributed to the January run up are in play now, and actually stronger than ever (likely more FTDs, more HODLers, Spy is in a more precarious position, etc). the whole thesis here is GME squeezing properly, right? It didn't actually squeeze in Jan/March. So the highly negative beta, which was due to GME surging \*but not squeezing\* remains an accurate proxy for its future moves relative to Spy, given the structural conditions regarding GME remain the same (heightened, if anything).

tldr: learn to read, then read the post. If that doesn't work: HOLD THE LINE ü¶ç. Big things are coming..

Sheesh what a rollercoaster... pretty terrible outcome today right? WRONG.

TODAY was a BEAUTIFUL day for GameStop loving, Ryan Cohen praising, üíéüôå Apes around the world and beyond.

You might be thinking, how can you say such a thing?? Are you in Australia and reading GameStop's chart upside down you idiot?? After reaching a high of $189.00 it fell almost $9..... Well, my ü¶ç brothers and ü¶ç sisters, allow me to explain.

/es (and SPY) has been in a consolidation zone from \~4130 ‚Äì \~4170 since last Friday. Despite common lore that stonks only go up, consolidation zones are actually very important patterns in the market and one of the best times to enter a position. While a stock/ETF bounces between a support and resistance level, it allows energy to build prior to an explosive move.

Don't believe me? Take a look at what /es guru Adam Mancini has to say on the topic...  [https://twitter.com/adammancini4/status/1341178772066889728](https://twitter.com/adammancini4/status/1341178772066889728)"Those who follow me know I mention "consolidation" or "basing" on a daily, and many find this boring or overlook it. For me its the opposite - consolidation precedes the most explosive moves, is the #1 signal I look for on all time frames, and comprises the best classic patterns"

Now, this afternoon /es seriously tore through its support levels at \~4130 (per Adam; \~4126 if you ask investing guru Cem Karsan): [https://twitter.com/jam\_croissant/status/1394650117395947527](https://twitter.com/jam_croissant/status/1394650117395947527)).

This means SPY is very likely to enter bearish territory moving forward. You may ask, what does any of this have to do with my beloved GME shares you turd? There are 2 points here.

1. GameStop has a severely negative beta. For the unaware, beta is a measure of how an individual asset moves (on average) when the overall stock market increases or decreases. GameStop having a negative beta means that historically, the stock goes up when the market (SPY) goes down.

Take a look at this... [https://ibb.co/zQWp7v9](https://ibb.co/zQWp7v9)

GME has a capital-structure adjusted beta of -21.6, which is INSANE. This means that GME is RADICALLY inversely correlated to movements in SPY (companies typically have betas of -1 to 1...).

Take a look at GME's year-to-date chart to confirm.. when GME surged in late January and mid March, SPY was declining. There are likely numerous reasons for this, including: market contractions causing lower liquidity for funds (due to losses, redemptions) which puts upward pressure on GME due to the large short exposures held by institutions (the margin call thesis); and retail entering GameStop as one of the few strongly performing investments during market declines (causing a positive feedback loop).

2. If you've stuck with me thus far, I think I might blow your chimp mind with this one..At any given time, there is an /es level for which GEX (gamma exposure) would be neutral. As of EOD today, that level was 4152.5...[https://twitter.com/TradeVolatility/status/1394747641192275968](https://twitter.com/TradeVolatility/status/1394747641192275968)

When gamma is positive, MM hedging strategies amplify upward market movements. When gamma is negative... you guessed it, MM hedging strategies amplify downward market movements. This strongly contributed to the mouthwatering red days / circuit breakers we experienced in Spring 2020.

NOW, this is critical... Wednesday morning (tomorrow!) marks the monthly expiration for Vix futures contracts (similar to how OpEx, or Options Expiration, occurs the third Friday of each month).

My tits are getting hard writing this: there have been only 4 instances in the past 10 years where VixEx corresponded to negative GEX. The subsequent 4-day performance for SPY was...

3/17/20 (-12%)

12/18/18 (-8%)

5/15/12 (-1%)

8/16/11 (-6%)

proof: [https://twitter.com/CycleWacher/status/1393183734829043713](https://twitter.com/CycleWacher/status/1393183734829043713)

Are you putting it together yet? There is a VERY strong chance that SPY gets destroyed in the week to follow. Based on the above (average of (-7%) move), the outlook is SPY to hit $383 within a week. I am not predicting this exact level as I am a simpleton. Instead I am simply inferring from the best available historic data and the best minds on FinTwit there's blood on the horizon..

If this does occur, it will lead to widespread panic and margin calls. Not so easy for Shitadel, Shillvin Capital, and the rest of their cronies to maintain astronomical short positions on GameStop when:

1. They've been investing on margin;
2. The market is down 7% or more in a week and GME has -21.6 beta;
3. Short sellers have lost $930 million on GME and AMC over the past 5 days (I suspect this is based on the "21.8% short interest", which we know is dishonestly calculated.. so real losses likely much higher).[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-short-sellers-sit-110554197.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-short-sellers-sit-110554197.html)
4. There are likely hundreds of millions of phantom GME shares that need to be covered;
5. Ryan Cohen / GameStop have acknowledged via Twitter that they are aware of #4, after receiving preliminary share vote data. I mean the guy literally tweeted MOASS last week from GameStop's twitter...
6. GME is at the tip of a beautiful months-long triangle pattern;
7. The ü¶ç own the GME float (proof in prior SuperStonk posts) and are holding onto their GME shares like they have rigor mortis
8. The divide between Wall Street and Main Street has never been wider, evidenced by vast wealth & income inequality, the trending video of the mother unable to afford Insulin for her child, etc.
9. There is ever-growing attention on GME & SuperStonk, and MSM purposefully not covering this mind-bending market manipulation on GameStop is increasingly manifesting in the Streisand Effect
10. Likely 10+ other tailwinds I have not addressed. My room temperature IQ can't think about more than 1 thing at a time

My fellow ü¶ç .. strap in, because the GME üöÄ launch is coming ever closer.. and any profits to be gained from spy puts or ARKK puts or AMC calls will need to be examined under a microscope compared to what's in store for the GME HODLers.

Not Financial Advice. Besides being irresponsibly long GME, my only expense is ordering crayons on Uber Eats. My urine has been rainbow for some time and I likely have pigmentation clogging my neurons and you shouldn't listen to my words.
