Maybe too much Mayo memes have made us think that they’re too stupid (maybe too stupid). They’ll want to take advantage of it.

The Glacier Capital bullshit was too obvious. Maybe too obvious and good to be truth. Remember, even if they’ve done some dumb shit, this people is still very smart. 

I think that they are using this strategy to have a MASSIVE opportunity to cover as much as possible. How? Incentivizing people to DAYTRADE. 

It’s so obvious that if Glacier Capital was margin called, many apes would call out the bullshit and know it’s a fake short squeeze. Hedgies know this, and they also know that this would incentivize many apes to day trade.

This could be very dangerous because it would help them cover. 

Patience Apes!! We just need to wait and found out how many votes there are to expose those mofos and fly to andromeda. Don’t bite the bait.
