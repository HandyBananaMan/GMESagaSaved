How are they gonna fake a squeeze if 'faking' it triggers the real one?  In order for it to be 'fake' it has to be high enough to be 'beliveable'. If it hits 300 do you think everyone who isnt informed is gonna be like \"oh yeah that's gotta be over\". Or do you think they're gonna be like \"holy shit I gotta buy in!\"\n\n\n\nShorts have been struggling to survive fighting apes and institutional longs. Literally doing everything they can to manipulate the media so FOMO buy in doesnt happen. I seriously see 0 possibility of them stopping the rocket if they try to 'fake' another takeoff",
