They\u2019ll want to take advantage of it.\n\nThe Glacier Capital bullshit was too obvious. Maybe too obvious and good to be truth. Remember, even if they\u2019ve done some dumb shit, this people is still very smart. \n\nI think that they are using this strategy to have a MASSIVE opportunity to cover as much as possible. How? Incentivizing people to DAYTRADE. \n\nIt\u2019s so obvious that if Glacier Capital was margin called, many apes would call out the bullshit and know it\u2019s a fake short squeeze. Hedgies know this, and they also know that this would incentivize many apes to day trade.\n\nThis could be very dangerous because it would help them cover. \n\nPatience Apes!! We just need to wait and found out how many votes there are to expose those mofos and fly to andromeda. Don\u2019t bite the bait.",
