Do they force the non-defaulting member to sell their offsetting position? Is the offsetting position taken away from the non-defaulting member and just used outright to cancel the position the defaulter passed to ICC members? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn options, when an option is terminated it means the buyer is legally allowed to cancel an executed trade. I just don't know how \"terminate\" would be defined in this case. Anyone care to chime in?",
