    "selftext": "TL;DR of the TL;DR: Tactics used to manipulate Gamestop have been used historically in other stocks as well. A lot of the DD here is true. If Gamestop gets more than 100% votes, the company can find out who was the cause and sue them for damages. If Gamestop refuses to, we as shareholders have the right to. (I personally believe Ryan Cohen will not let us down. I don't think we'll ever need to sue ourselves, but this is just here to prove that it's inevitable)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideo only has like, 15k views and we have almost 300k people. In light of this travesty, I'm going to be force-feeding wrinkles down your throat and into your brain (That's how biology works, right?).\n\nHere's a very **SHORT** list of important info for apes with fewer wrinkles revalent to Gamestop. There's a lot of more complex info or more legality information I omitted because it would be better to just watch the AMA.\n\n\"Each one of you is important to the cause. . . It's gonna take all of us to make a change\" - Wes Christian\n\nThe \"bad guys\" rig the market by selling or lending shares that they don't deliver, get analysts to print bad news about the stock, get an SEC investigation started and get a class-action lawsuit against the company. **EVERY UNDELIVERED SHARE IS A LIABILITY ON THEIR BOOKS.**\n\nUsing calls and puts to create synthetic shares has been around for a long time ([post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) explaining it). One share can be lent out to multiple people.\n\nFailure to deliver can be hidden in subsidiary companies. (Glacier hedge fund 'made up' to hide FTDs?)\n\nCash account shares are being illegally lent out. Contact your broker to make sure they are not, get a lock-up agreement if possible. It's not standard but it can be done.\n\nThe reported short interest is garbage. It's often 50-100% more.\n\nThere's a lot of things that even the DTCC can't prove, and doesn't know. We should not allow the DTCC to regulate themselves.\n\nThe market makers can put up FAKE SELL WALLS, and have nearly no obligations to the market.\n\nProprietary trading and stock lending are the largest moneymakers, and stock lending is mostly just shorting a stock to the ground.\n\n\"I've had clients throw. . . 30 million and it doesn't make a difference. They'll sell you counterfeit shares as long as you want.\"\n\n\"In the next 3-6 months, you're going to see a lot on the legal side. We've increased our bench exponentially, we put a big pot of money together and we're gonna go after this in an unprecedented way. We're not in this for money. . . you'd have to be crazy to do this for money.\"\n\nTheir mission is to kick the can down the road as long as possible. Deep ITM calls are often used to hide their positions.\n\nShort sellers need to drive the price down. They get more money if share prices go down so they can short it harder. (Big green days are great news, it bleeds the hedge funds more. A pricier share is a small price to pay.)\n\n\"I think Robinhood would be liable for market manipulation \\[and be sued for damages if enough damage has been done.\\]\"\n\nOver half of the 70 companies I've examined, more than 100% votes have come in. Over 200% is not unusual at all. Synthetic shares are rampant.\n\nWhat happens if Gamestop receives 200% votes? \"You figure out who's responsible for that extra 100% and you go sue them, real simple. . . If the corporation won't do it, you as the group of shareholders can go and do it. The board owes \\[the highest level of\\] duty to the shareholders.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there's anything wrong with what I wrote or missed any important points, let me know in the comments. I'll update this post frequently.\n\nWe're not crazy. The DD we've read about all of this time has been right.\n\nBuy. HODL. Vote.",
