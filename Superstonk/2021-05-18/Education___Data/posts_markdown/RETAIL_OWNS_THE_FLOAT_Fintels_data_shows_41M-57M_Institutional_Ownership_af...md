# Institutional Ownership Least Case Scenario

Institutional shares as shown right in the overview page [https://fintel.io/so/us/gme](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme).

# Institutional Ownership Almost Best Case Scenario

If you scroll down the same link above, shows a list of all ownership. The screenshot below are just share ownership (Calls/Puts deleted). You'll also notice the filing date on the left which is color coded from latest to oldest, most of which is pretty recent.

# Summary

I choose the 2nd Institutional Ownership scenario, why? Because:

1. Its more detailed (owners, shares, and date)
2. Excel did the calculation rather than someone entering manually
3. I like my confirmation bias

Edit1: Answering some comments and something to think about. If you add all with Vanguard name, total is only 801,683. If you add all with Blackrock name, total is 2,245,825. You will agree that here is no way they only hold that much. So now tell me, how are those being double counted? Is it possible that since it is already counted somewhere else, say etf's, they only counted what they actually have hence the small number.

Edit2: Please disregard Edit1. I am terribly sorry for all the confusion. u/salientecho have pointed out that the owners indeed does not match up with the numbers. I have corrected this, the total Institution is now 57,902,457 from 57,964,041. Similarly, the "Remaining" was adjusted accordingly. From the bottom of my heart, I am deeply sorry. Thank you u/salientecho and Thank you especially to those who also pointed it out but I was too lazy to check. Love you all
