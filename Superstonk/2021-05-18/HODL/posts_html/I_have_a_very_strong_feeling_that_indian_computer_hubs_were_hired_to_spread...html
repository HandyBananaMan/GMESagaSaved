<h1>Title: I have a very strong feeling that indian computer hubs were hired to spread FUD on reddit for cheap. They are also giving away awards to any post that contains Glacier Capital. No matter what the context is. Just the word Glacier Capital is enough. Putting this one to test.</h1>

<p>It comes with no surprise to how common these call centres and computer hubs are in India. They provide tremendous amounts of services like scam calls, be it social media hyping or even international companies outsourcing something like spreading FUD online for dirt cheap. Yes that is what shitadel and friends are doing. During mid march Glacier capital was the highest searched in India as Kenny and friends were coming up with a new form of FUD to spread amongst apes. We clearly saw how any Glacier Capital post got many awards no matter what the context was pro glacier or not and that is due to lack of education. The so called hubs hire people with bare minimum knowledge/education.</p>
<p>Why you may ask? 
There are a lot of people that are hired in these scam hubs and the job requirements are just enough to use a computer and English knowledge should be around 40%. </p>
<p>These small time indian firms have been funded with our beloved western Shills to go ahead and spread FUD online and why is that we always see so many people online on these reddit subs in the pre hours like at 2 am 3 am monitoring these pages and downvoting or giving awards up to 60-70 in 10 minutes because it’s fucking day time in India. </p>
<p>Short holders have gone beyond unimaginable tactics and FUD spreading campaigns and we should be ever so vigilant and prepare for only worse. </p>
<p>The hour is near and the squeeze is closer than you think. Their attempts are getting worse. </p>
<p><em>REMEMBER</em>
WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AS WE JUST HODL💎🤚. THEY HAVE EVERYTHING TO LOSE EVEN THEIR LIVES. </p>
<p>GME TO THE MOON.

<p>🦍 APES TOGETHER STRONG 🦍 </p>
<p>Peace and love ❤️</p>
<p>Edit: i posted this in the day time. India is asleep around then. It may or may not be true but a lot of posts throughout the early hours were getting a shit ton of awards just because of the word Glacier Capital. I did not do this for karma whoring or For awards as i gain nothing from Reddit but just beautiful DD from amazing apes on here. Love y’all keep up the good work!</p>
