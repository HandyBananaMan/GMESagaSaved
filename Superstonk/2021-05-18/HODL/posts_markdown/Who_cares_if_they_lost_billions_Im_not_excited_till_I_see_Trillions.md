Idc if they lost 1 billion or 100 billion. That's peanuts. That's not gonna change the world. It's good, on the right track but we celebrate for a second and move on. Continue holding til the insurance kicks in. Continue holding til they hold press conferences to defend their losses. Continue til kenny is in cuffs. Continue until the DTCC issues a negotiation AMA in the sub asking what it will take to buy the shares.

Everything else is not dance worthy.
