<h1>Title: $180 isn't just a sell wall, they're trying to make it a psychological one, they want to condition us. We need to push through it and break it. They want us to believe that we risk loaing by buying at this level. But they lose millions for every dollar past we push. 💎🙌🦍🌜🚀</h1>

<p>They've been stacked on 180 for weeks now, they've built a massive sell wall, this is the "What's behind $180 Ken!?" that's become so well known here.</p>
<p>Their goal is not only to keep the price down but to also build this psychological and fear based wall.</p>
<p>We know the price is fake, we know it's being highly suppressed. They want apes to fear that anything in the high $170's or above is going to put them in the negative.</p>
<p>They want this barrier built milking the "buy the dip" mentality then we hit $180 and for apes to be nervous about spending at this level.</p>
<p>When this thing takes off if you have cash sitting for the next dip that never comes down to this level again during MOASS you're going to look back and wish you had bought a few more.</p>
<p>I averaged up today knowing that it's inevitable and not wanting to regret not investing it once this rocket is on its way to the moon.</p>
<p>We're retarded, its time we act like it.</p>
<p>Not financial advice, retarded advice.</p>
<p>Every penny past $180 is more blood they bleed, it may not even be margin call territory, but if hedgies lost $930 MILLION on a BULLSHIT "21% short interest on the float" (We know its FAR higher as that's a self reported lie) I can "risk" $10-20 more per share.</p>
<p>They are likely struggling to keep us down at this point. The higher we go the less resources they have to fight us. Given all the obvious FUD tactics they've been using I think they're getting desperate.</p>
<p>I've only been at this for 2 months, I'm an xx hodler, I've poured a tremendous amount of time into learning about this but I still have only a few wrinkles. However what I lack in knowledge of finance I make up for in understanding people. How individuals and groups approach things. I've been obsessed my entire life about know what makes people, groups, and societies tick. They're losing the financial game terribly, so now they're trying desperately to win the psychological one.</p>
<p>Keep up the pressure fellow apes, we're winning every single day.</p>
<p>Random note, cheers to our Korean ants and the crazy ass Aussies from a Canuck.</p>
