<p>Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>As of today, GME is officially part of the S&amp;P MidCap 400! You may have noticed the absolute ridiculousness in the last few minutes of trading yesterday - clearly there was some manipulation happening. We've known this of course, but it's always so helpful to have the daily confirmation. I applaud the strength of our collective Diamantenhände through all of these psychological attacks. The short hedge funds know that time is running out, and they have been steadily trying to shake us, to make us distrust each other, to make us question the very thesis behind the MOASS.</p>
<p>It won't work. We know the DD is solid. GameStop has completely reversed course over the past year, and today is a stronger company than ever, with huge opportunities for growth and the leadership and resources to capitalize on them. The MOASS is inevitable, and Apes will be ready when it does.</p>
<p>Today is Wednesday, August 4th, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>

<p>FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.18824964. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check <a href="https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie">Lang &amp; Schwarz</a> or <a href="https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099">TradeGate</a></p>
<p>I've asked u/thecactusblender to cover a few days later this week when I am not certain I'd be able to run this thread. Thank you so much to them for stepping in to help!</p>
