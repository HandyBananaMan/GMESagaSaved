<p>Edit1: As u/BohemianConch pointed out, the test was supposed to be conducted back in 2020, but it was pushed to 2021 due to corona, which explains the weird intervals.</p>
<p>Edit2: Looking at the 2018 stress test, the stress exerted on the system seems to have increased 30-50% across the different test parameters from the last test.</p>
<p>So, I work in a large european bank. Today I saw a very interesting article on our internal site (I cannot provide a link for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>This article explained the EBA stress test that went down a few days ago.</p>
<p>The stress test tested to see how the banks would handle a 30% drop in the housing market, negative GDP growth and increasing unemployment and a pretty modest inflation (If you ask me 2.4% over 3 years sounds low compared to the 6.12% the americans aim for over 3 years.) <img alt="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/EU-wide%20Stress%20Testing/2021/1017758/EBA-2021.3792-2021-EU-wide-stress-test-infographics-reports.png" src="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Risk%20Analysis%20and%20Data/EU-wide%20Stress%20Testing/2021/1017758/EBA-2021.3792-2021-EU-wide-stress-test-infographics-reports.png" /></p>
<p>~~As far as I can see, the previous tests has been conducted with 2 year intervals, on even years.~~</p>
<p>~~This begs the question, why are we testing now?~~ See Edit1.</p>
<p>I havn't looked at the results of the tests, Il leave up to the fractal wrinkle brains.</p>
