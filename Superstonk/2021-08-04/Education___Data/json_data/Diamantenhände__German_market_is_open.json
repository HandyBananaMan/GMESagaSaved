    "selftext": "Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nAs of today, GME is officially part of the S&P MidCap 400! You may have noticed the absolute ridiculousness in the last few minutes of trading yesterday - clearly there was some manipulation happening. We've known this of course, but it's always so helpful to have the daily confirmation. I applaud the strength of our collective Diamantenh\u00e4nde through all of these psychological attacks. The short hedge funds know that time is running out, and they have been steadily trying to shake us, to make us distrust each other, to make us question the very thesis behind the MOASS.\n\nIt won't work. We know the DD is solid. GameStop has completely reversed course over the past year, and today is a stronger company than ever, with huge opportunities for growth and the leadership and resources to capitalize on them. The MOASS is inevitable, and Apes will be ready when it does.\n\nToday is Wednesday, August 4th, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 120 minutes in: **$154.62 / 130,12 \u20ac**  *(volume: 1451)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 115 minutes in: $155.36 / 130,75 \u20ac  *(volume: 1430)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 110 minutes in: $154.71 / 130,20 \u20ac  *(volume: 1332)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 105 minutes in: $154.84 / 130,31 \u20ac  *(volume: 1313)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 100 minutes in: $155.60 / 130,95 \u20ac  *(volume: 1286)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 95 minutes in: $155.91 / 131,21 \u20ac  *(volume: 1107)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 90 minutes in: $155.93 / 131,22 \u20ac  *(volume: 1074)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 85 minutes in: $156.43 / 131,65 \u20ac  *(volume: 1046)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 80 minutes in: $157.29 / 132,38 \u20ac  *(volume: 985)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 75 minutes in: $157.04 / 132,16 \u20ac  *(volume: 959)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 70 minutes in: $157.62 / 132,65 \u20ac  *(volume: 911)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 65 minutes in: $153.60 / 129,26 \u20ac  *(volume: 714)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 60 minutes in: $153.14 / 128,88 \u20ac  *(volume: 633)*\r\n- \u2b1c 55 minutes in: $153.08 / 128,82 \u20ac  *(volume: 525)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 50 minutes in: $153.08 / 128,82 \u20ac  *(volume: 402)*\r\n- \u2b1c 45 minutes in: $153.02 / 128,78 \u20ac  *(volume: 389)*\r\n- \u2b1c 40 minutes in: $153.02 / 128,78 \u20ac  *(volume: 370)*\r\n- \u2b1c 35 minutes in: $153.02 / 128,78 \u20ac  *(volume: 327)*\r\n- \u2b1c 30 minutes in: $153.02 / 128,78 \u20ac  *(volume: 277)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 25 minutes in: $153.02 / 128,78 \u20ac  *(volume: 186)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 20 minutes in: $152.96 / 128,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 186)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 15 minutes in: $153.02 / 128,78 \u20ac  *(volume: 91)*\r\n- \u2b1c 10 minutes in: $152.96 / 128,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 58)*\r\n- \u2b1c 5 minutes in: $152.96 / 128,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 54)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $152.96 / 128,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 43)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 US close price: $152.75 / 128,55 \u20ac   *($152.80 / 128,59 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18824964. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)\n\nI've asked u/thecactusblender to cover a few days later this week when I am not certain I'd be able to run this thread. Thank you so much to them for stepping in to help!\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
