    "selftext": "Edit1: As u/BohemianConch pointed out, the test was supposed to be conducted back in 2020, but it was pushed to 2021 due to corona, which explains the weird intervals.\n\nEdit2: Looking at the 2018 stress test, the stress exerted on the system seems to have increased 30-50% across the different test parameters from the last test.\n\nSo, I work in a large european bank. Today I saw a very interesting article on our internal site (I cannot provide a link for obvious reasons).\n\nThis article explained the EBA stress test that went down a few days ago.\n\nThe stress test tested to see how the banks would handle a 30% drop in the housing market, negative GDP growth and increasing unemployment and a pretty modest inflation (If you ask me 2.4% over 3 years sounds low compared to the 6.12% the americans aim for over 3 years.)
