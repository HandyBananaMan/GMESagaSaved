    "selftext": "If you and your SHF buddies were short GME to an *absurd* degree and you've illegally coordinated with them to suppress the price (and continue to) while being at the center of SEC and possibly DOJ investigations, you'd want the chart to look the way it does since early June.\n\nYou and your buddies might have learned that the tricks you've employed for over a decade don't work on GME anymore. No more stop-loss hunting, no more spoofing, and no more bullshit news stories about GME being a dying brick and mortar store.\n\nYour only hope is to slowly, painstakingly, and continously short GME with the last bit of breathing room GMEs 5 million share offering gave you and your buddies. You might make a little money in the process, but what's a few million barely profitable shorts compared to the hundreds of millions of shares that will eventually need to be bought back.\n\nThis will be the last chance to get the price as low as possible in the most organic-looking way possible before GME reveals its crypto plans - you and your buddies death knell.\n\nHowever, your approach doesn't solve the biggest issue you've had all along...the lower the price is, the more that individual investors will buy-in.\n\nedit:\nu/fiery_chicken_parm has a great point in one of the comments\n\n\"If I held a bunch of GME shorts right now, I'd be terrified of tanking the price. I'd also be terrified of a spike. Both of these scenarios can trigger FOMO buying.\"",
