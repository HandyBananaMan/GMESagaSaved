<p>Just wanted to make a quick PSA letting everyone know that if they are going to shop at GameStop, try to buy their used products. Having worked there years ago, we were always encouraged to sell used games &amp; consoles over new games &amp; consoles as this gives the company the biggest profit margins. </p>

<p>Okay, folks, I think that about wraps it up. I'm sure that this has been mentioned before but never hurts to remind everyone.</p>
