<p>tl:dr of section: This was already punted once for comment, but the commission has what it needs now and is approving the rule change. </p>

<p>tl:dr of section: FINRA names information they are going to require collected (total available collateral in the member’s custody, margin and non-purpose loans, collateral securing margin loans, etc.) of any member with $25 million or more in free credit balances and each member whose aggregate amount outstanding under repurchase agreements, securities loan contracts and bank loans is equal to or greater than $1 billion, as reported on the member’s most recently filed FOCUS report, as required to file the SLS and provide this information. Oh, this is on a monthly basis now...  </p>
<p><img alt="tl:dr - we have to get extra personal with the information collection because we realize your balance sheets are lies and the storm is coming..." src="https://preview.redd.it/idk323torff71.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3a880e8df47bc8f6e9893e1918c6a472015a2ef" /></p>
<p><img alt="tl:dr of section: 85-100 broker-dealers comprise this universe they are super concerned about liquidity for in a 'stress event'..." src="https://preview.redd.it/rpfh2e5asff71.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec868499f8a8fa6dbda95aae6ace8a91d4d20e99" /></p>

<p>TL:DR - New reporting rule on collecting information about total available collateral in the member’s custody, margin and non-purpose loans, collateral securing margin loans, etc. for 85-100 broker-dealers FINRA is decidedly worried about in a liquidity stress event... </p>
