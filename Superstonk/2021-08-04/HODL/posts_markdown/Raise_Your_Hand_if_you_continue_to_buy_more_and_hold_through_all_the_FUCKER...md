Been here since January seeing all the ups and downs of this heavily manipulated stock. While trying to buy more every paycheck...

I just want you all to remember. Nothing has changed. Trust the DD.

* We own the float.
* They need to close their positions.
* The price is wrong.

If you bought at 250 why wouldn't you buy at 160?

**HODL!** *For holding is the way!!!*
