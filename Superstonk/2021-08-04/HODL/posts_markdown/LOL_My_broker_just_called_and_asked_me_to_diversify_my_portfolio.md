Yo so the title pretty much tells the story lol but my broker called, (for the first time mind you,) to ensure I diversify my portfolio. I declined and instead said I have diversified my broker's on the same stock lol

The man was quick to tell me to take what you all say with a grain of salt, to which I said I'm a big boy and to mind his business!

This makes me hella bullish! They didn't call me in January nor did they call in March or June lol biiig things coming!

Obligatory 🚀🌙🇦🇺🦍

Edit: stock pushed was "robindahood" various crypto and to copy "professional" investors. I said it's funny how insiders of the thieving button breakers dump shitloads at IPO and it skyrockets....?

Edit 2: broker is etoro.. also shiiiit never thought id get traction like this, happy ape! Thanks for awards and updoots xox
