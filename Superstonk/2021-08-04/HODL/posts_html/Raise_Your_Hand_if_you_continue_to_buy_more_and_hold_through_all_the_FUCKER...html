<p>Been here since January seeing all the ups and downs of this heavily manipulated stock. While trying to buy more every paycheck...</p>
<p>I just want you all to remember. Nothing has changed. Trust the DD.</p>
<ul>
<li>We own the float.</li>
<li>They need to close their positions.</li>
<li>The price is wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you bought at 250 why wouldn't you buy at 160?</p>
<p><strong>HODL!</strong> <em>For holding is the way!!!</em></p>
