<p>This is definitely old news for you wrinkly sacs out there, but for smoothies like myself, it might be a fresh insight which adds another drop to your everlasting ocean of determination!</p>
<p>It just dawned on me that with its string of gamma squeezes, GME's chart looks more like that of a penny-stock rather than a <strong>$12B</strong> company... its massive 12-month price fluctuation of <strong>3580%</strong> is unheard-of for a company its size. </p>
<p>90% of my portfolio is invested in this <em>dying brick-and-mortar company</em> [lmfao]; erstwhile, I'm using the other 10% to swing-trade pennystocks, mostly to keep myself occupied while waiting for the MOASS. As you probably know, <strong>volatility</strong> is what makes pink sheets so lucrative and so dangerous. Tonight, I started doing research on the past year's <strong>most volatile stocks</strong>, hoping to identify trends among those that have had the most explosive gains.</p>
<p>I started by screening for stocks that had a <strong>price change</strong> of <strong>over 3000%</strong> in the <strong>last 12 months</strong>. As it turns out, there are only <strong>77</strong> of them out there... unsurprisingly, <strong>76 of them are pennystocks.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="All the companies I recognize are micro-caps, except for GME [on the second page]." src="https://preview.redd.it/86oovvbd2af71.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01921014811c8883926a09ee5eec657cb6edc438" /></p>
<p>I was curious to know how many other non-pennystock companies are on this list, so <strong>I filtered out all the stocks worth less than $10</strong>, and the results genuinely surprised me:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="LMAO. I tried to distract myself from GME, only to spend the evening with Jacque." src="https://preview.redd.it/qu0zqgtq2af71.png?width=1062&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bced95b72b0af3b8007870c6345b24123101c869" /></p>
<p>GME is the <strong>only</strong> large-cap stock out there that has seen this magnitude of volatility since the liquidity from last year's unmitigated currency dilution (AKA "stimulus") flooded the market and intensified the pace of artificial price inflation.</p>
<p>The influx of buying pressure and resultant gamma squeeze in January "awoke" the sleeping retail Silverback. But what is far more revealing than the initial gamma run is all the price movement that occurred <em>afterwards</em>, from then to now. Untrained eyes might not see it when they look at the chart; that's precisely what sets Apes apart from everybody else. <strong>I</strong> <strong><em>see</em></strong> <strong>it.</strong></p>
<p>The writing is on the wall. It is abundantly obvious the squeeze never ended, and that there's been a very consistent and violent effort to suppress upwards price momentum in spite of a tsunami of buying pressure. This brazen market manipulation has been documented every step of the way, shared for all to see, and that's exactly why they are fucked--the elephant in the room [predatory short selling &amp; market manipulation] has been ignored for years, but now there's also a silverback gorilla in the room flinging shit in every direction and getting the elephant riled up. <em>I am impossible to ignore.</em></p>
<p>I know something else now, too: by aggressively manipulating the stock in order to suppress the price and shake out retail investors, 'Megacorp' inadvertently showed its hand--<strong>now I</strong> <strong><em>know</em></strong> <strong>I have the winning hand.</strong> They tried too hard to deceive me with opaqueness, financial magic tricks and psychological warfare; by trying to discredit me as a "memer" and discourage the average person from taking me seriously, they inadvertently red-pilled me. <em>Now, I'm not going anywhere,</em> for I know this squeeze cannot end in any other way but a <strong>galactic</strong> surge in price and hopefully some meaningful systemic reform, evidenced by lifelong prison sentences for ultra-wealthy felons whose greed predicates a complete disregard for human society and the wellbeing of every other being on Earth.</p>
<p>I know you're too retarded to sell your memestonk. You have proven that beyond a shadow of a doubt, and now I am convinced that all <em>I</em> have to do is hold my shares, and buy more whenever I can afford to, and then sooner or later... <strong>*pop*</strong></p>
<p>Indulge me, won't you, as I end this post with a visual aid to illustrate how I think we all feel deep down. These are not charts of GME, but of another asset that shan't be named--I'll call it Baby Tabby Cat.</p>

<p><img alt="Let's pretend this second peak is $100,000. Any intelligent person would sell at this point.

<p>This chart takes place over several years. I expect the MOASS to play out over a much shorter period of time. But I am fully prepared to wait, <em>no matter how long it takes</em>. I expect the ups and downs to be a lot more volatile and unpredictable--but with a similar end-result <strong>(UP)</strong>. I wanna see Stevie get liquidated.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I buy, I hold, and I chill.</p>
