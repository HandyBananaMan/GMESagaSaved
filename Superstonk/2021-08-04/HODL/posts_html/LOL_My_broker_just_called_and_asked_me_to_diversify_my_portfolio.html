<p>Yo so the title pretty much tells the story lol but my broker called, (for the first time mind you,) to ensure I diversify my portfolio. I declined and instead said I have diversified my broker's on the same stock lol</p>
<p>The man was quick to tell me to take what you all say with a grain of salt, to which I said I'm a big boy and to mind his business!</p>
<p>This makes me hella bullish! They didn't call me in January nor did they call in March or June lol biiig things coming!</p>
<p>Obligatory 🚀🌙🇦🇺🦍</p>
<p>Edit: stock pushed was "robindahood" various crypto and to copy "professional" investors. I said it's funny how insiders of the thieving button breakers dump shitloads at IPO and it skyrockets....?</p>
<p>Edit 2: broker is etoro.. also shiiiit never thought id get traction like this, happy ape! Thanks for awards and updoots xox</p>
