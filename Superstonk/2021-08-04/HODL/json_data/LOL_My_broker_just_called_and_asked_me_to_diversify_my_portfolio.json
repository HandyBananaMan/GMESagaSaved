    "selftext": "Yo so the title pretty much tells the story lol but my broker called, (for the first time mind you,) to ensure I diversify my portfolio. I declined and instead said I have diversified my broker's on the same stock lol\n\nThe man was quick to tell me to take what you all say with a grain of salt, to which I said I'm a big boy and to mind his business!\n\nThis makes me hella bullish! They didn't call me in January nor did they call in March or June lol biiig things coming!\n\nObligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd8d\n\nEdit: stock pushed was \"robindahood\" various crypto and to copy \"professional\" investors. I said it's funny how insiders of the thieving button breakers dump shitloads at IPO and it skyrockets....?\n\nEdit 2: broker is etoro.. also shiiiit never thought id get traction like this, happy ape! Thanks for awards and updoots xox",
