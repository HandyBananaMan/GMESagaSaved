Total between these three for 06\\/30\\/21: $455,819,634,437](https://preview.redd.it/uv0ai02pmff71.png?width=1575&format=png&auto=webp&s=c474fd90d60d1f8f8f7c6e4626491b7222687fdc)\n\nI cross-referenced the above data with [https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-repos-with-the-federal-reserve/](https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-repos-with-the-federal-reserve/) and I determined it was accurate and safe to use from that point on. (saved butt loads of time) heh..butt..\n\n***LOOK HOW FUCKING MUCH FIDELITY IS USING THE RRP AS OPPOSED TO THE REST OF THE PARTICIPANTS.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFidelity alone accounts for 11 counterparties, and has dominated everyone. Blackrock and JP Morgan ***combined*** are just shy of half that of Fidelity's dollar amount, and have only a combined 9 participating \"counterparties.\"\n\nMy hypothesis, as per usual..\n\n***SHARE MOTHER F\\*CKING LENDING!!!***\n\nPossibly due to the massive inflow of traffic?\n\nWhat about Vanguard?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Only 3 funds.](https://preview.redd.it/n6s0576rnff71.png?width=349&format=png&auto=webp&s=7df0037ae12a391c99ffbea512c7c7c42069adae)\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund  : *$14.3 BILLION*\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund: *$9.8 BILLION*\n\n\u25a0\u00a0Vanguard Cash Reserves Federal Money Market Fund *$5 BILLION*\n\n*VANGUARD TOTAL:* ***$29.1 BILLION, 3 counterparties***\n\n**\\[to speed things up, I'm just going to give the aggregated total for the remainder:\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GOLDMAN SACHS, MARCH-JUNE. \\(this loophole only works once per month on the last day of the month\\) $57 BILLION](https://preview.redd.it/c5do6v38pff71.png?width=281&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9a38d8b0420de216cfb4b49bdffb692124c962)\n\n***You'll notice a familiar trend with this subset of data. Look at FEB*** *FEB, WUT DOING!?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7vcl3fjqff71.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=072994980e72eb6b02bc148184e2be03e67af6c8\n\nLMFAO, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME, THIS SHIT HAD NO DEMAND IN FEB.. AND BECAUSE APES HELD, ALL OF A SUDDEN, REPO GOES TITS TO THE SKY, AND THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT?\n\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS WHY WE HOLD.\n\nI find it hard to believe that this market magically and mysteriously goes absolutely crazy after a bogus hearing where they tried to paint DFV as the manipulator.\n\nI really think based off of this data that they never expected us to make it through Feb. They bet on us all selling, calling the squeeze squoze, until DFV blew everyone's mind on TV when he basically testified under oath that, and I'll never forget, \"I like the stock. I'm as bullish as I've ever been on a potential turnaround for GameStop.\"\n\nThis jacks my little tits so nice!\n\nNot sure what to make of this, as most of us are in Fidelity, and they clearly have the most exposure to the RRP program.\n\nWUT DOING?\n\nHere's the rest of the counterparties exposed to RRP:\n\nJP Morgan\n\nLegg MasonFranklin TempletonT.

All I haven't done yet is count the individual counterparties included in this data set. Based on data, APES holding in FEB is a direct cause of the demand for the RRP market likely due to share lending. I'm tired holy shit.\n\nI believe this website may be missing ONE MMF series...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***MMO SERIES TRUST***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's where I look next.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"nOt fINanCiAL aDviCe\"",
