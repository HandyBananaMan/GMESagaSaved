<h1>Title: Look, I get a lot of young ape energy is excited about the SEC or whatever, but it's a little nauseating. They have a history of talking big and doing nothing. Let us judge them by their actions, like RC asked of GameStop. The SEC has done nothing so far, so to us they are nothing. End of story.</h1>

<p>The community of apes has a lot of youngins high on enthusiasm and hype. That's all good, but ape history does have a lot of hero worshipping tendencies. Let's take it down a notch or two here. This isn't a SEC apologist sub, it's a GME sub. Get back to basics here, buy HODL, patience.</p>
<p>Once the SEC actually does something, then they get a cookie. Not before, no cookies to hand out based on the sweet kiss of promise.</p>
<p>SEC goon let banana go, then SEC goon get ape praise. We wait patiently, we see what actions these mother fuckers take whether it's hedge funds, white house, SEC, or GameStop, we judge based on data and actions. That's it.</p>
