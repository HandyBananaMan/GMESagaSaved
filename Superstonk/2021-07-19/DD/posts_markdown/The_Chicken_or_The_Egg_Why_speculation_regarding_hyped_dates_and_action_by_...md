# **This is a repost for visibility. I believe this needs to be seen by as many people as possible to avoid a GME selloff triggered by disappointment when the MOASS does not occur on a hyped date or after action from RC.

# Uvxy, GME, and movie stock are almost all following the same volatility linked pattern.

You may be asking yourself why this matters, let me grant a couple wrinkles to your smooth brains:

UVXY is 1.5x leverage ETF based on VIX short term futures. It is volatility linked, thus, the higher the market volatility, the higher the IV, the more valuable futures become, the more valuable UVXY becomes.

There has been many DDs that show SHFs have been hiding FTDs with ITM/ATM/NATM calls. They are hiding thoseÂ Â in numerous ETFs containing GME.

So market volatility equals higher IV, higher IV means higher delta, as delta increases, market makers have to buy shares at market price to remain delta neutral.

# Hypothesis:

**The price of the GME rises and falls in tandem with IV due to the mass amount of shorts being hidden in ETFs. That is why GME has been purported to be beta negative. Market wide volatility is associated with red market days, which would consequently make GME effectively beta negative. We also see this with movie stock, as GME and movie stock move in tandem.**

*To add, I only use Robinhood for the charts, all my assets are in a TD account.*

**The stocks that are being manipulated using futures, would show the same chart pattern as a volatility linked ETF (this association can be seen more on low volume days like today).**

# BUT BUT What about the deviation from VIX in March and May??

*If you compare the charts of VIX and GME, you see VIX spike at the same time GME gamma squeezed in January. They are directly linked. You will notice that VIX spiked in March and in May/June, but GME did not to the same degree. Why is this you might ask? Well, in both March and June, RC offered a boat load of shares, thus increasing intraday volume, and increasing supply. This would have counteracted the affects an IV increase would have on GME.*

# Chicken or the Egg?

This realization has lead me to believe that the MOASS would not first be triggered by GME, but a market flash crash, that would initiate a gamma squeeze in stocks positively correlated with volatility. This hypothetical event would in turn, have marg come calling.

**According to this DD:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oncs4a/oh\_fck\_youre\_gonna\_make\_me\_gamma\_a\_brief\_post/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oncs4a/oh_fck_youre_gonna_make_me_gamma_a_brief_post/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

# GME is in a prime setup for a potential gamma squeeze that    could lead to the MOASS.

This is entirely speculative so do with this information what you will, but this has my tits jacked.

\*\*\*I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise.

TLDR:

**On low volume days, GME is identical to UVXY, further confirming that the price is correlated with the options used to hide shorts, and thus is correlated with market wide IV.**

Here is the link, for shits and giggles, to the chicken and the egg meme posted by u/realDeegzScotland, at the same time I posted my DD. Simulation confirmed.
