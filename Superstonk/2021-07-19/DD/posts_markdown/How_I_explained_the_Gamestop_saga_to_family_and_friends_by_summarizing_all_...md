I cannot tell you what to do, and I am not giving you financial advice. I am only expressing my personal opinion as if we were having a conversation at dinner or at a bar. I am an active shareholder of Gamestop stock, and I like the stock.

&#x200B;

The complexity of the financial system has made the financial crisis of 2008 inscrutable, and I believe that is one of the reasons why the people responsible for it have not been criminally charged despite decimating countless lives. The economic crisis in Europe and North America in 2008 led to more than 10,000 extra suicides, according to figures from UK researchers.

# Do you find it strange that several brokerages did not allow people to buy shares of Gamestop at the beginning of 2021?

&#x200B;

How does such a thing happen in the United States—a "free country?" In a free market, the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government or other authority and from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies, and artificial scarcities. The demand to purchase shares of Gamestop was extremely high early in 2021, yet Americans and many others across the world were not allowed to buy any at one specific point in time. Was there a lack of supply of GME stock? If there is a decrease in supply while demand remains the same or higher, usually the price of that product increases: for example, water is more expensive at an outdoor music festival in the summer than at your local grocery store in bulk. There are other ways of dealing with lack of supply besides outright halting the purchase of a stock.

&#x200B;

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/how-does-law-supply-and-demand-affect-stock-market.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/how-does-law-supply-and-demand-affect-stock-market.asp)

&#x200B;

I am not sure that the halting of the purchase of shares in a company has ever happened before in the United States. Many people were angry, frustrated, and morbidly curious as to why such an event would occur. Financial events that affect the United States have the potential to impact the global economy, so an event like halting the purchase of a specific stock can be expected to be scrutinized on the world stage. 

&#x200B;

The halting of the entire stock exchange has happened a few times in the past due to war, 9/11, the pandemic, etc. but not individual stocks. This halting of buying Gamestop shares has led to congressional hearings, class action lawsuits, and further mistrust in what is supposed to be a free and fair market. Investigating the motives of the people who would benefit from the general public not buying shares of Gamestop has led to some interesting findings.

&#x200B;

# III.

&#x200B;

# There is evidence that Gamestop was under threat of undergoing a short squeeze . . . and still is.

&#x200B;

A short squeeze is an unusual condition that triggers rapidly rising prices in a stock. For a short squeeze to occur the security must have an unusually high degree of short-sellers holding positions in it. These short-sellers—usually people with large amounts of wealth like hedge funds—made bets (called selling options) that Gamestop would go bankrupt. For the average investor, purchasing a stock makes him or her a profit if they sell the stock after the price increases. The opposite occurs when short selling a stock: makes you a profit if the price of the stock goes down, but loses you money if the price goes up. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, Gamestop had a high likelihood of going bankrupt in 2020 (with the share price going down to zero), especially with the market conditions associated with the pandemic at play and the comparisons to Blockbuster; however, Ryan Cohen—now board chairman of Gamestop—acquired a 12.9% stake in GameStop last year for $76 million and has a new vision to make Gamestop the "Amazon of gaming." His financial strategies have permanently increased the price of Gamestop's shares, which was a devastating turn of events for the short sellers.

&#x200B;

Short selling occurs when an investor borrows shares of a stock and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money. Short-sellers bet on, and profit from, a drop in a stock's price. Let's hypothetically assume that Gamestop has a farm of bananas with 70 million bananas, and each banana has a sticker with the Gamestop logo. Let's say that on 1/28/21 Kenny G (a short seller) borrows a hundred bananas from Gamestop's banana farm through a brokerage and immediately sells it to Susie Q. Hanna for $20 (resulting in Kenny G immediately getting $20 in his pocket), and he promises to buy it back from her later. 

&#x200B;

If the price of those bananas drops to $10 one month later, Kenny G can buy the bananas back for $10 and pocket the difference: this makes him a profit of $10. Susie Q. Hanna is hoping the price of those bananas goes up. If the price of those bananas rises to $40, Kenny G has to pay an extra $20 to buy those bananas back from her to close his short position: this results in a loss of $20 for Kenny G and a profit of $20 for Susie Q. Hanna. Kenny G must finally return the bananas to the Gamestop farm of bananas or to whomever originally owned them. I will return to this story later.

&#x200B;

Stock lending, borrow fees, conflict of interest of Citadel being both a hedge fund and a market maker, and other factors are significant but are beyond the scope of this message.

&#x200B;

According to CNBC, at least one of the Gamestop short sellers closed their positions already:

&#x200B;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html)

&#x200B;

According to CNBC, the short squeeze on Gamestop is over:

&#x200B;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/gamestop-breaks-below-50-a-share-as-short-squeeze-comes-to-an-end.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/gamestop-breaks-below-50-a-share-as-short-squeeze-comes-to-an-end.html)

&#x200B;

Did I just write you a message for no reason? Am I wasting your time? Why would I say Gamestop was under the threat of a short squeeze . . . and still is? Didn't I just give you two articles from a reliable news source that stated the opposite?

&#x200B;

Allow me to help you understand why those CNBC articles are wrong. It is a fact that lying to the media is not illegal and is protected under the first amendment. The fines for lying to FINRA about your financial information are very low: it would be like making a profit of $1 million dollars and getting fined pennies for lying. Therefore, hedge funds and other similar investors are financially incentivized to provide false or misleading information.

&#x200B;

# The "Everything is a Cake" meme helps illustrate the practice of naked short selling.

&#x200B;

There are two numbers that would end all speculation on the Gamestop short squeeze: the true short interest and the number of shares of Gamestop owned by all retail investors. Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Historically, short interest as a percentage of float above 10% is fairly high, indicating that the the general sentiment is that a stock's price will fall in the near future; short interest as a percentage of float above 20% is extremely high.

&#x200B;

The public float is a term that refers to the number of shares of stock a company has issued to the public that are available for investors to trade: as of 7/19/21 it's 56.41 million shares of GME. Shares outstanding refer to a company's stock currently held by all its shareholders, including the public float and share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders: as of 7/19/21 it's 74.38 million shares of GME. "Insider" is a term describing a director or senior officer of a publicly traded company, as well as any person or entity, that beneficially owns more than 10% of a company's voting shares; for example, Ryan Cohen's shares of GME are not available for public trading, but he can use his shares to vote at the shareholder meeting.

&#x200B;

A class action lawsuit against Robinhood by The Rosen Law Firm confirms that GME was shorted 226% (and one other stock at 38%) as of 1/15/21. You may have heard of other "meme" stocks in the news, but GME is the only stock that is under threat of undergoing the biggest short squeeze due to its extraordinary short interest. Yahoo! Finance reports the same figure with short percentage of float at 226.42% and short percentage of shares outstanding at 101.92% as of 1/14/21.

&#x200B;

If you want the source from the lawsuit, scroll to the bottom and click "View Complaint."

&#x200B;

[https://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-register-2029.html](https://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-register-2029.html)

&#x200B;

The reported short interest of GME according to Yahoo! Finance was the following:

&#x200B;

Short percentage of float (Jan 14, 2021): 226.42%

Short percentage of shares outstanding (Jan 14, 2021):  88.58%

&#x200B;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20210129164718if\_/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210129164718if_/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

&#x200B;

Short percentage of float (11/12/20): 297.13%

Short percentage of shares outstanding (11/12/20): 103.52%

&#x200B;

[https://web.archive.org/web/20201130212429if\_/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130212429if_/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

&#x200B;

At this point, you might be asking how a stock can be shorted more than 100%. The answer is naked short selling. In a healthy, well-regulated market, shorting a company more than 100% would be impossible. Naked short selling has been plaguing the United States for decades now despite being illegal here and many other countries. It has led to bankruptcies of companies (Toys "R" Us), loss of American jobs, and further enrichment of the ultra wealthy.

&#x200B;

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-killed-toys-r-us-hint-it-wasnt-only-amazon-1535034401](https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-killed-toys-r-us-hint-it-wasnt-only-amazon-1535034401)

&#x200B;

What is naked short selling? Much of the information I have provided to you can be found in Investopedia.

&#x200B;

Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares of stock that have not been confirmed to exist. Despite being made illegal after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, naked shorting continues to happen because of loopholes in rules and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems.

&#x200B;

Remember our hypothetical example of Kenny G selling bananas to Susie Q. Hanna? There is more to our story! When he initiated the transaction on 1/28/21, he lied to Susie Q. Hanna because he sold her bananas that looked exactly like the real thing, but they were fake. Insiders and retail investors had already owned or bought every single one of the authentic, legitimate bananas (70 million) with the Gamestop logo sticker directly from the Gamestop banana farm. It's like the "everything is a cake" meme. Kenny G never owned or borrowed authentic, legitimate bananas from the Gamestop banana farm; in fact, he manufactured the bananas "out of thin air" by baking a cake that looked exactly like a bunch of Gamestop bananas. The brokerage that allowed Kenny G to borrow the fake bananas in the first place may threaten him with a margin call and will eventually force him to buy the bananas back at a loss (it doesn't matter that they are fake) if the price of Gamestop bananas rises to a very high price and remains there for a long time (possibly somewhere between $250 - $500 per banana or more).

&#x200B;

If the price of Gamestop is so high that Kenny G is finally forced by his brokerage to buy the bananas back from Susie Q. Hanna, the price of Gamestop bananas may potentially rise at a rapid rate. Fearing that the stock will continue its upward move, other short sellers will move to exit their short positions by buying back the bananas they have borrowed, which adds fuel to the fire and attracts more buyers (for fear of missing out) and pushes the stock’s price even higher. Because there are none of the authentic, legitimate bananas left to buy back, Kenny G is forced to buy the bananas he borrowed at any price (thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, etc.) because the supply of authentic, legitimate bananas is essentially zero, and the demand is extremely high.

&#x200B;

Selling naked options creates unlimited risk. Therefore, these types of option strategies are considered appropriate for sophisticated traders with proper risk management and discipline due to the potential for unlimited losses.

&#x200B;

Wes Christian, who I will talk about later in this message, describes naked short selling using the metaphor of xeroxing the title of one car hundreds of times then selling these non-existent cars to hundreds of people while owning one actual car the whole time. Most people would go to jail for illegally selling something they do not own, but naked short selling happens all the time in the US stock market.

&#x200B;

Naked short selling dilutes and diminishes the value of a stock because it introduces counterfeit shares into the total number of shares.

&#x200B;

The above is simply a summary of the mechanics of a short squeeze and is all publicly available information:

&#x200B;

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

&#x200B;

Short squeezes can also be gradual. It's possible that Tesla's short squeeze was a long time in the making, and how long it took to get to the beginning of its short squeeze is difficult to say, but it took about a year or so for Tesla to reach the height of its short squeeze from its initial run-up in 2020 - 2021 with a peak price of $900. Its "reported" short interest was anywhere from 18 - 30%. Beyond Meat was also a recent infamous stock that underwent a short squeeze at one point after its IPO.

&#x200B;

# Math, facts, and other verifiable evidence regarding the Gamestop short squeeze.

&#x200B;

It's mathematically impossible for the Gamestop short sellers to have closed their short positions. Using common sense, publicly available data, and examples of short squeeze(s) from the past, anyone in the world can figure this out herself or himself. I will give you one example of a short squeeze from the past, Volkswagen, to make general or broad comparisons with GME. I will also give you one example of how corrupt our financial system is. Lying, hiding of true information, refusing to enforce or change SEC rules and regulations, fining unethical or illegal actions very small amounts of money—the amount of corruption in our financial system is staggering. Many experts in finance have expressed their opinion that Regulation SHO did not do enough to address the corruption in the stock market, including naked short selling. Moving forward, I am hoping that Gary Gensler will enforce the rules and regulations of the SEC or enact change, but I am not necessarily counting on him to do the right thing. However, I know that I can count on myself to do the right thing.

&#x200B;

Once again, it has been confirmed with 100% certainty that the short interest of GME was at least 226% as of 1/15/21, which is an astronomical amount.

&#x200B;

The Volkswagen (VW) short squeeze, one of the most famous of all time, reached a peak of $1,261 from $254, and its short interest was just 12.8%.

&#x200B;

![https://a.c-dn.net/c/content/dam/publicsites/igcom/uk/images/ContentImage/2.jpg](https://a.c-dn.net/c/content/dam/publicsites/igcom/uk/images/ContentImage/2.jpg)

&#x200B;

How was the Volkwagen short squeeze so violent when its short interest was much smaller than Gamestop's?

&#x200B;

Although the conditions of the Volkswagen short squeeze are quite different from Gamestop, there are also similarities. The market failed to appreciate the true availability of tradable shares to cover these short positions. The available public float of Volkswagen went down to 1% of outstanding shares because Porsche made a surprise announcement that they they were going to increase their position in VW. The high short interest combined with the lack of available legitimate shares in the public float made one of the biggest short squeezes in history because Porsche owned so many shares in a highly shorted stock.

&#x200B;

What is the true short interest of Gamestop stock? How much of the available public float do you think has been bought up by investors in Gamestop all over the world? Unfortunately, the general public has no way of confirming this type of information in real time. The financial system is designed in a way to make information difficult to obtain, hide information, give partially true information, or simply report incorrect information (with the punishment of a small fine as a result). For example, access to the information in a Bloomberg terminal will cost you approximately $2,000 per month or $24,000 per year.

&#x200B;

If our financial system was transparent, honest, and fair, one potential way the world could have known how much of the available public float was bought by investors in Gamestop was by the voting in the Gamestop shareholder meeting. Unfortunately, with the way the counting of votes is conducted, the true number of votes may never be known (I will explain below). The number of votes a shareholder has corresponds to the number of shares she or he owns. The votes were counted up until 4/15/21. If the total number of votes exceeded 70 million, then that would have confirmed that there were no authentic, legitimate shares of Gamestop available to be bought. This is the number of total votes counted: 55,541,279. Each vote represents one share of GME. The public float was 54.75 million shares, and the shares outstanding was 70.03 million shares in April.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind that that's a huge undercount of the vote and number of shares that people own internationally. The potential Gamestop short squeeze is known worldwide. Not everyone voted, and not everyone *can* vote because certain brokerages simply don't allow it (especially international GME holders). The vote itself is bogus as Wes Christian said because they just throw out votes that exceed the public float. For example, if 531 million shares of GME were bought globally, the vote at the shareholder meeting would only account for roughly 55 million votes and the rest of the votes would be disregarded (which is exactly what happened this year).

According to mainstream media and available public financial reports, the people or institutions that shorted GME closed all their positions in January or February, and the short squeeze is over. This is "evidenced" by reports of short interest being 14.18% as of 7/18/21 (which is still high actually).

&#x200B;

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

&#x200B;

If the mainstream media and the financial reporting to the public is the truth, then I have three questions:

&#x200B;

1) Why was buying of shares of Gamestop stock restricted at the beginning of 2021?

&#x200B;

2) Why was the selling of shares of Gamestop allowed at the same time buying of shares of Gamestop was restricted at the beginning of 2021?

&#x200B;

3) How did the short interest of Gamestop stock drop from a high at one point of 226% (as of 1/14/21) to 27.23% (as of Apr 14, 2021), but the peak price of the Gamestop "short squeeze" only reached $483? As a reminder, the height of the Volkswagen short squeeze reached a peak of $1,261 from $254 with a short interest of 12.8%, and the height of the Tesla short squeeze reached $900 with a "reported" short interest of 18 - 30%.

&#x200B;

The answers to these questions can be answered with everything I have told you or will tell in this message.

&#x200B;

To answer the question as to why buying of shares of Gamestop stock was restricted at the beginning of 2021, it must be noted that Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told the House Financial Services Committee in February that he had discussed the trade restrictions with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears public trades, after it made a $3 billion margin call. However, DTCC CEO Michael Bodson told the committee in May that "the decision to restrict trading really was internal to Robinhood, we did not have discussions about that." Therefore, what Vlad Tenev told congress under oath seems to be false or misleading.

&#x200B;

According to speculation on the internet, the short interest in GME could be anywhere from 226% - 1,000%, and the number of shares of Gamestop people own around the world could be anywhere from 163 million - 531 million. You can find more information about Gamestop on the following website (ask the people on the following subreddit which other subreddits are useful):

&#x200B;

[reddit.com/r/Superstonk](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk)

&#x200B;

Numerous people all over the world have written about how short interest can be faked, lied about, or hidden. All short positions must eventually close, but short sellers have tricks up their sleeves to "kick the can down the road" and delay closing their short positions—most likely to delay a short squeeze or to convince retail investors to give up and sell their shares. If there is a dire lack of supply of authentic, legitimate shares of Gamestop stock, the only way short sellers can close their short positions is if people sell their Gamestop shares:  the less of a supply there is of authentic, legitimate shares of Gamestop, the more people can sell their shares for higher prices. If the supply of authentic, legitimate Gamestop shares is zero, then people can essentially name their price (no matter how high) when it comes to selling their shares. The evidence I will give you below all points to the fact that the Gamestop short squeeze was simply delayed—not stopped.

&#x200B;

If naked short selling didn't exist, Gamestop stock would be worth much more than its current listed price. The price of shares of Gamestop has been heavily manipulated and does not reflect the genuine value that would be manifested by organic supply and demand. The president of the NYSE has admitted this fact. 

&#x200B;

[https://www.reuters.com/business/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-2021-06-16/](https://www.reuters.com/business/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-2021-06-16/)

&#x200B;

The punishments for false reporting about short interest or naked short selling are extremely small fees compared to the overall profits that have been made via these tactics. The SEC unfortunately does not enforce the current regulations or is unwilling to enact change. Crowdsourced research about illegitimate short interest has been found in the reddit links I gave you above. Below are some of the most important math, facts, and other verifiable pieces of evidence we have about false reporting about short interest, naked short selling, and other corrupt practices associated with Gamestop securities. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, the crowdsourced research about the Gamestop short squeeze produced by redditors is the second most important crowdsourced research project in the history of mankind second only to Wikipedia.

It was in the shortsellers' best interest to bankrupt Gamestop with naked short selling. What happens when an investor maintains a short position in a company that gets delisted and declares bankruptcy? The answer is simple: the investor never has to pay back anyone because the shares are worthless. Companies sometimes declare bankruptcy with little warning. Other times, there is a slow fade to the end. A short seller who didn't buy back the stock before trading stopped may have to wait until the company is liquidated to take a profit. However, the short seller owes nothing. That is the best possible scenario for a short seller. Eventually, the broker will declare a total loss on the loaned stock. At that point, the broker cancels the short seller's debt and returns all collateral.

Gamestop paid off all of its debt; sold enough stock to obtain nearly $2 billion dollars of cash on hand to grow and strengthen their company; recently hired experts with experience at many different companies (Amazon, Chewy, Walmart, QVC, etc.); obtained new fulfillment centers; built a team for a non-fungible token (NFT) platform based on Ethereum; and much more.

Short Sellers have set cancer research back at least decades from their abusive tactics.

We are convinced that the various State Securities regulators, if they understood the concept of naked short selling, would have had an absolute fit if they knew that the SEC was even considering allowing market makers to sell entities that don't exist and thereby dilute the equity ownership of investors in their states, or to fraudulently distribute counterfeit shares of public companies domiciled in their states. This only illustrates how little people know about "naked short selling" and the role of the DTCC.
