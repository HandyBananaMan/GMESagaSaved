I've seen it commented and posted a few times now, and it caught my eye because it's out of line with what we've always chanted, Ape No Fight Ape. But I think the recent situation is going to be, or is currently, getting spun a certain way.

Due to the recent drama, and the outcome of said drama, there has been a significant upswing in posts saying things along the lines of "I don't even like any of you, I just like the stock" "some mod drama isn't going make me sell, I don't care about anyone else" and things along those lines. Some are in reference to the recent departure tweet, but I've also seen it tacked on to other comments.

The mantra has always been, Ape No Fight Ape, Be Nice to New Apes and teach them, be the change you want to see mentality.

Now, Due to the mod drama, we no longer care about our fellow investor/ape/people? We are only out for ourselves? I think the statement is getting distorted, we don't care about Shills, FUD spreaders, or manipulation/control tactics of any kind.

I feel like this forced statement of "I don't care about anyone but me" is trying to sow the seeds of doubt that people are only out for themselves, that people wont hodl, that they will sell on the way up because they only care about their own gains. They could push FUD and fake position posts saying they got out early because they don't trust anyone else and don't want to be a bag holder.

People always ask/say "HAH, you think THIS is going to make me sell? Drama won't make me sell"

But you have to remember, these tactics aren't a direct correlation. Its not expected that drama=sell, they would set up and take very small, very incremental steps to push sentiment/narrative the direction they want it to go.

Large scale it could be, first is don't trust the mods, next is don't trust fellow hodlers, then it's don't trust the thesis/MOASS. Within each of those steps is many many small options and steps to accomplish that.

I STRONGLY feel this is just one of many small facets.

Screw that. I Care About all of you. About everyone. I want all people everywhere to have a happy and bright future. Even the people we compete against in this epic tale we've been living, I hope they have happy, bright futures and lives. To want anything less means we don't deserve what we are fighting for. 

I personally choose to buy and hodl, buckle up, and wait for the bright future I see from Gamestop. Watch what they do, everything else is a distraction.

Not financial advice, just a concerned ape <3
