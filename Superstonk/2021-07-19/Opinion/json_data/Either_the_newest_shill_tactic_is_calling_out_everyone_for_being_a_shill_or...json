    "selftext": "For well over a month, I have watched members of this community grow louder and louder with their paranoia and shill accusations, attacking other community members. There can only be one of two explanations to this: 1) the bad actors are the ones doing this or 2) vocal members of this community have grown paranoid beyond reason.\n\nI'll tell you one thing: it wasn't like this just a month ago. Yeah, there were always the shill accusations, but not this frequently, and not with these levels of anger and delusion. \n\nWe've added over 100,000 new members in the past month, and it shows. For most groups, regardless of what it's centered around, the loudest are always the ones heard first. It's just how it goes. But I won't see this sub devolve into some conspiratorial, ape vs. ape battleground.\n\nIf you think you're fighting FUD by calling anyone and everyone a shill paid by Citadel, you're doing the exact opposite. YOU are the FUD. You make this community look like paranoid idiots. It makes people question the validity of anything that is said here when you act so nonsensically. I don't really care what people think generally, but I try to imagine people like dlauer and Dr. T seeing this shit and cringing, because it sure happens to me, and I'm FUD proof. Brain too smooth for it.\n\nWe know what we need to know. The MOASS is coming. We like the stock. For the sake of this community, have some self awareness. At the end of the day, nothing here matters but this company and the MOASS. **N O T H I N G**. \n\nIf someone seems like a shill to you, question why you think that way, and come to a reasonable conclusion. If you still think they're a shill, report them. It's the best option. You don't need to write up an entire theory for why you think Ken Griffin is paying them to shit talk GME or anything else.\n\nI love this stock, I love this community, and I can't wait to inevitably be called a shill for posting this. Buy & hodl.",
