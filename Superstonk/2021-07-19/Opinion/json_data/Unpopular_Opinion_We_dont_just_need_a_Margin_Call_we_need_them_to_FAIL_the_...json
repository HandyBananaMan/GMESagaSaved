    "selftext": " I keep seeing posts thinking Marge Calling is the Catalyst to this starting/ending. My completely uneducated, non fact providing guess, is that they have been getting margin called over and over the last few months. They have been passing the margin requirements by liquidating cryptos, other stocks, fudged numbers, etc. They have a million tricks up their sleeves to pass the calls plus they're friends with the ones making the calls.\n\nWhat we need is them to FAIL the margin call. We need them to be LIQUIDATED. I don't want to see marge memes, I want to see liquid? memes.\n\nTL:DR (idk how, it's like 4 sentences, put some fucking effort in ape): Margin Calls don't mean a single thing until they fail them. Sure, it keeps pressure on them but it's basically a \"Hey, I lent you $40 billion, you good on that right?\" \"Yea bro I'm good, I got like $3 billion in dog coin I'll sell off, Elon's in space anyway\" \"Ok cool thanks\"\n\nLet's hype the calls but not count our chickens before they hatch. Be level headed. Buy and Hold.",
