Early December holder here, I quit my job today. I couldnâ€™t handle the stress and demand. In my time working there I had seen over 20 other co-workers come and go. Countless mental break downs, chronic pain, the stress of working 45+ hour weeks just to barely make it by. Iâ€™m tired of it, and to show how much I believe in GME I quit. 

I also plan to start documenting my accounts of this saga so far. Iâ€™ve been through every event, every fud attack, every sub, every dip, and every rip. My blood sweat and tears are with this stock, I have a deep connection with this company that I know we all have. No matter what happens I just really LOVE this STONK 

For my fellow silverbacks, TOO THE FUCKING MOON ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ 
(Back in the old days when we had positive news this is what we said, I want to bring it back)

Edit: pretty sure Iâ€™m being down voted a lot not sure why
