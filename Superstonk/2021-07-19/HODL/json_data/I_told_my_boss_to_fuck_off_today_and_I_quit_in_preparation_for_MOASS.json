    "selftext": "Early December holder here, I quit my job today. I couldn\u2019t handle the stress and demand. In my time working there I had seen over 20 other co-workers come and go. Countless mental break downs, chronic pain, the stress of working 45+ hour weeks just to barely make it by. I\u2019m tired of it, and to show how much I believe in GME I quit. \n\nI also plan to start documenting my accounts of this saga so far. I\u2019ve been through every event, every fud attack, every sub, every dip, and every rip. My blood sweat and tears are with this stock, I have a deep connection with this company that I know we all have. No matter what happens I just really LOVE this STONK \n\nFor my fellow silverbacks, TOO THE FUCKING MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n(Back in the old days when we had positive news this is what we said, I want to bring it back)\n\nEdit: pretty sure I\u2019m being down voted a lot not sure why",
