<h1>Mod Resignations And Addition</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olxepi/gamestop_is_hiring_a_new_director_of_sec_and/">GameStop is hiring a new Director of SEC and Financial Reporting who will oversee "the equity process including tasks related to stock-based compensation, equity rollforward, shares outstanding, calculation of basic/diluted EPS," etc. Bullish!</a></p>
<p>Essentially Gamestop is looking to hire a professional full-time to manage everything GameStop stock-related (presumably, the accounting department took care of it previously) from forms to annual proxy statement to potential dividends if GameStop decides to do so.</p>

<p>Sounds like the NYSE wishes to rollout circuit breakers (the thing that stops trading for 10 min if a stock price goes up or down too fast) for the entire market permanently.</p>

<p>I have more than likely missed a lot of DD's and posts due to the mess over the weekend and I wasn't expecting to make a daily post so if I have missed something important please comment and tag me and I will try to add it if I can.</p>
<p>And apologies if the comments are a bit short, I'm not used to writing a lot and I like to be concise and to the point.</p>

<p>EXCELLENT!</p>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO DONT TRY TO EXPLOIT YOUR FANBASE, THIS WOULD ALSO BE EXCELLENT!</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
<p>If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.</p>

<p>Edit MoonJam is tomorrow Not today (was writing this at 4 am so forgot dates lol).</p>
<p>Edit lots of grammar.</p>
<p>Edit according to the "Bringing in the fire extinguisher." post Broccaaa left the mod team but he/she is still in the mod list so idk if they have left or not if a mod could clear it up that would be great.</p>
<p>Edit some people have asked me why I decided to make a daily stonk so here is a small writeup if you care <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/onab8m/the_daily_stonk_07192021/h5qnt07/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/onab8m/the_daily_stonk_07192021/h5qnt07/?context=3</a></p>
<p>And the reason I decided to keep the same format is 1 because I quite like it and 2 it feels like normal and I wanted to try and leave the weekend behind for the weekday folk that like normalcy, I wasn't too sure if I should keep the some of the more rensole parts like the last part but I didn't really want people to feel like I stole the format and twisted it into My own when I was just gonna post a roundup of the weekend, and the other times someone else covered they didn't remove it so I kept it.  <strong>¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</strong></p>
