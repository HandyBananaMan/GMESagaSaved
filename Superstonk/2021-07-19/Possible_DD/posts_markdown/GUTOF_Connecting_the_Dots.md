Hello everybody!

This will be an attempt to connect the dots between some of the DD I have been reading here, mainly between the fantastic DDs and research of fellow individual investors providing bonafide research you probably can't pay for even if you had the money.

I'm flairing this as Possible DD because it's speculation. I tried to remain grounded and tried to use as much facts and logic as my cerebral cortex and my temporal lobe allowed me but it's still speculation.

I hope by diving deeper into what I will discuss here, we *(the curious individuals who like the stock completely independently from one another)* will be able to put our minds together and brainstorm to figure out exactly what is going on.

Think of it as a Grand Unified Theory of Fuckery or simply **GUTOF!**

Sorry if the name sounds grandiose. It's a joke. I don't pretend to have figured out anything what-so-ever. These are just the ramblings of a single person and therefore can be a little/half/mostly or completely wrong. I don't have any finance education. I got into investing in February when I heard about GameStop. GME is my first (*and now only*) stock. Therefore everything I say must be taken with a massive grain of salt.

&#x200B;

I want to go step by step and fully understand - if that is possible - the following:

1. What happened leading up to January? Story of the deep OTM puts.
2. What happened in January? Who has been holding the bag since?
3. What is happening now?
4. Conclusion - TBC?

&#x200B;

Without further ado, let's get to it.

# 1. What happened leading up to January? Story of the deep OTM puts.

Let's go back to April 2^(nd) 2020 when GME closed the day at $2.85/share. Imagine buying GME at that price... You had funds like DOMO scratching their heads at why a company is trading at a level below the cash/share in it's treasury.

I believe this is where the short positions that turned into the $0.50 and other deep OTM puts came from. I believe - as I tried to explain [in the comments section](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm_puts_are_the_passed_puck_of_short_positions/h5qdy34/) of u/Criand's latest post, that Melvin and Citadel Advisors went short these shares through a dark pool. They may have been buying and selling these shares among each other in a dark pool, much lower than the market price, for example at 0.50$/share. They would be doing this in order to crash the price and force the company to be delisted - which would mean they would not ever have to close their shorts.

Now the real tinfoil hat question, what if Blackrock or Vanguard or another big player swooped in and yoinked some of those shares at those prices and that's how the SHF game went out of control? Just something to think about. By the way, it was none other than u/TDETLES that got me thinking about this, [when he asked me this, right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oej80d/when_gme_was_shorted_140_literally_any_hedge_fund/h46odn6/?context=3).

FYI we have actually seen vastly underpriced transactions in the dark pools before (like 80ish$/share when the market price was 200$+). I have been looking for 2 hours and I can't find the video or the screenshots anywhere. If anyone knows what I'm talking about and knows where to find it, please share with me so I can add it to the post.

When the price reached 20$ in December 2020, the SHFs still had not closed their positions. Then January happened.

&#x200B;

# 2.1. What happened in January?

![The Sneeze. God Bless You GameStop!](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F6054f8d0068cea16946daf95%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale)

I think that when the sneeze happened, Citadel Securities (the MM) created a stupendous amount of *synthetic long positions* by buying naked calls and selling puts of the same strike price.

Melvin Capital and Citadel Advisors converted their massive, catastrophic short positions to *synthetic short positions* by selling naked calls to and buying those puts from Citadel.

For more information on how this "works" *(it really shouldn't)* [read this document](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf) prepared by none other than our favorite - the SEC. It's not that long but it's enough to make you want to throw up.

u/Criand explains this concept very well [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm_puts_are_the_passed_puck_of_short_positions/). (See #2)

A picture speaks a thousand words and I'm quite proficient in Paint.

# Abra Cadabra! HYPOTHECATE!

![STEP 1 - Transfer real short positions for a synthetic short position so you can testify under oath that you've closed your short positions ](https://preview.redd.it/i2a1zbvi18c71.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a5335b14b4e7db120837d82a62a8257fcde82d5)

# Hokus Pokus! RE-HYPOTHECATE!

![STEP 2 - Exercise naked call, get your phantom shares that don't exist, do whatever you want. ](https://preview.redd.it/9cdfd5uo18c71.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ae687cead0892bd7b0bd9c0ef4ebeee3129f0b4)

Now Melvin and Citadel Advisors owe all those shares to Citadel Securities. What's a couple million shares between friends anyway?

# But wait, Citadel Securities has exercised and sold those shares to the market but have not yet delivered. So in essence, Citadel Securities is now also short to the market.

So... what is Ken to do? Does he have enough juice to hold a toxic position like this? Let's think... If we **only** consider the 60 million-ish shares sold short at the $0.50/share price point... at the 482$ level this is a loss of 481.50$/share. Multiply that by 60 million and you get... 28,860,000,000$. That is 28 billion 860 million U.S. dollars. Let's see if Citadel Securities can possibly tank this damage.

*(( All numbers above are estimated. The real numbers are most likely different from this. ))*

Remember, this is only 1 price level as interpreted from those OTM puts... there are others.

Citadel Securities [balance sheet at the end of 2020](https://sec.report/Document/0001616344-21-000004/CDRG_StmtFinCndtn2020.pdf) had 66.7 billion dollars of long positions and 57.5 billion dollars of short positions with only 523m$ in cash. Even if they were able to liquidate all of their assets without a loss - tough task - ![they only had a cushion of 3.15 billion dollars](https://i.imgur.com/JNzrQZ7.png). Just the one position above would cost them 28.9 billion dollars... This means instant bankruptcy. This is why they intervened and stopped the January run in its tracks. They would have all been wiped out from existence, possibly in a single moment.

# 2.2. Who has been holding the bag since?

So Ken has a literal armed nuke in his hands, it's counting down and it's going to blow. There is no way out, nowhere to run. Someone needs to take it off his hands. Who would do something this crazy?

Enter u/AcedVector with [this monster of a DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7fsqc/where_and_how_citadelother_hedge_funds_have_been/). This was the DD that made me begin thinking about how all of this connects to each other.

I'm not going to go too deep into total return swaps here. Check out the DD above and as always, do your own due diligance. DYODD!

Basically, Ken had a massive short position that he has to close. He has to deliver those shares. So what does he do? Who takes such an insane risk?

Who else but the usual suspects? The banks. The fucking banks. Their balance sheets are trillions of dollars. They could hold this toxic position for some time and as we know from the 2008 mortgage crisis, those bank managers love selling swaps for those juicy fees. The more they sell, the more fees they collect, the bigger their bonuses. It's the same thing over and over again...

He writes covered puts and tells the banks something like this. I wasn't there so I'm guessing.

*"Hey I have these puts and these shorts. I have marked them to the price point of the shorts, why don't you take my short positions out of my hands and if the price of GME goes up, I pay you the difference. If the price of GME goes down, you don't have to pay me anything because I'll just take back my position and cover. In the meantime, dear bank manager, your bank will make a shitload of money from selling me the swaps and you get to collect your bonus. By the way, did I tell you that I completely control the price and it will go wherever I want anyway? Don't worry GameStop will go bankrupt anyway and I won't have to cover anything and the swaps you're holding won't put you under any risk after that."*

Who in particular? I don't know. Probably BoA. They are Citadel's prime broker. Maybe Credit Suisse. They have proven dumb enough to do this type of thing before. Goldman? Why not? They're always in the middle of everything. Truth is, this is impossible to know.

# 3. What is happening now?

As you might know, the volume of GameStop has gone down to the level of a leaky, dripping faucet that keeps you from sleeping at night. That is to say -close to no volume. I subscribe to the opinion that the only reason this is still going on is because there is close to no volume and if there is any serious volume coming in the MM ($hitadel) will lose complete control of the price and we will witness a cascade of margin calls leading up to the MOASS.

What we are currently seeing is the MMs and SHFs using the innate leverage in an options contract ( Î”  x 100) to swing the price of the stock by making possibly heavily leveraged options trades. The current price movement is almost completely dependent on the options chain as u/Criand again explains really well [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm_puts_are_the_passed_puck_of_short_positions/) (See #3).

Citadel Securities LLC is a market maker who is a member of the DTCC, the NSCC and the OCC. This gives them certain privileges that we retail investors can not possibly dream of. They can write/sell naked options, make naked sales if it is a long sale *(for liquidity...ok...)*, pick apart and reassemble ETF shares for ETFs *(if they are authorized by the issuer - and they are in most cases)* as long as they can back up their trades by showing to the NSCC that they are [financially responsible *(LMAYO)* and operationally capable *(not for long)*.](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf) \- Rule 15. Basically, they can pretty much do whatever they want as long as they stay solvent and on the good side of the NSCC.

This is the reason we are seeing this insane options activity. Immediately exercised ITM puts to crash the price, OTM puts to hide shorts, deep ITM calls to satisfy FTDs, naked calls to dilute stock... All of this is possible due to Citadel and Citadel can do this because the NSCC and the OCC allow it.

None of the rules that were passed recently were actually necessary to take down Citadel.

The OCC always had the means to kick Citadel out of the market **at any time**. [They can apply Rule 1102](https://www.theocc.com/getmedia/9d3854cd-b782-450f-bcf7-33169b0576ce/occ_rules.pdf;) or - if Citadel objects - [Section 14 of their bylaws and suspend any rules](https://www.theocc.com/getmedia/3309eceb-56cf-48fc-b3b3-498669a24572/occ_bylaws.pdf) preventing them to kick Citadel out.

The NSCC can also wipe Citadel **today** if they wanted to, all they have to do is to [apply Rule 46 and Rule 22](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf) *(if any of its own rules can be used to prevent it from suspending Citadel)*.

But alas, the regulators are snoozing or ... you know ... NSFW...

Jokes aside, I hope they actually have a plan and they're just waiting for some unknown process to be finished so they can go to town on these crooks.

# 4. Conclusion

I actually have more tinfoil to spread around. My head is full of it and the more I travel through the bowels of this sub, the more my mind is blown with the simple brilliance of some of you people and I spray tinfoil everywhere.

I want to also go into Synthetic ETFs (check out u/Horror_Veterinar's work about this) as well as how this will impact the entire economy. Check out [u/Freadom6](https://www.reddit.com/user/Freadom6/)'s DD on this.

If you guys want to see more of this, let me know. If not, that's fine. I'll go back to the daily and hang out with my fellow apes there.

Peace & Love!
