<p>(Convoluted as fuck. I hate these assholes. Take all info with a grain of salt. We all could be wrong.)  </p>
<p>The buy-write is a quick transaction:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The SHF sells deep ITM CALLs to a Market Maker (or other counterparty). They choose deep ITM CALLs due to the almost guaranteed trade between the two parties. It is unlikely that others would be using these deep ITM CALLs.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Market Maker sells shares to the SHF. They can sell these shares without first locating them in a bonafide agreement. So, despite liquidity, the trade can be performed.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SHF now has enough shares to spoof to the Clearing House that they "met their FTD closeout obligations" because they "have the shares". The FTDs that are reported drop off a cliff.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Market Maker wants to remain neutral in this trade. They exercise the deep ITM CALL to get the shares that they sold to the SHF back to them and the trade is closed out.    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What happened here is that the SHF never lost their original short position and the Market Maker remained neutral in the trade without generating additional shorts.</p>
<p>So in the entire buy-write transaction, a deep ITM CALL is used to swap these shares. These typically happen on the same day and CALL OI does not increase because the options are closed out right away.  </p>
<p>edit:  I don't know why I didn't link to the DD before, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm_puts_are_the_passed_puck_of_short_positions/">here</a>. Criand gets all the credit. I just cherry-picked out that explanation.  </p>
<p>But what about second edit?: If I read the DD right, and I'm sure I didn't, the 43 million shares show up on the books Monday morning. No T+* to think about, just Auto-Marge.</p>
