<p>I got this rather alarming text today:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Which doesn't sound good at all. I haven't clicked on it nor do I intend to. Note the `.ru` part of the address in the domain, which does not resolve to the same IP address as <a href="https://robinhood.com">robinhood.com</a>. If anyone else gets this I'd highly advice against clicking on that URL.</p>
<p>My shares are not in Robinhood. I have not placed any trades in Robinhood since Febraury.</p>
<p>Whoever sent this knew my personal email, phone number and that I had a Robinhood account. That does not seem good.</p>
<p>I'm working right now so I won't be able to follow the conversation much. I more wanted to get this information out in case anyone else receives this type of message.</p>
