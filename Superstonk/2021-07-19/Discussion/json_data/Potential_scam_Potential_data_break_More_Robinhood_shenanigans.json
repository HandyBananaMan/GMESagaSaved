I haven't clicked on it nor do I intend to. Note the \\`.ru\\` part of the address in the domain, which does not resolve to the same IP address as [robinhood.com](https://robinhood.com). If anyone else gets this I'd highly advice against clicking on that URL.\n\nMy shares are not in Robinhood. I have not placed any trades in Robinhood since Febraury.\n\nWhoever sent this knew my personal email, phone number and that I had a Robinhood account. That does not seem good.\n\nI'm working right now so I won't be able to follow the conversation much. I more wanted to get this information out in case anyone else receives this type of message.",
