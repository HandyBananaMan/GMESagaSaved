    "selftext": "I seen a post in DDintoGME about options and it got me thinking. With all the recent \"shorts hidden in options\" talk last week, I figured I'd take a quick look and see what comes up.\n\nThe numbers are absolutely massive.\n\n(Link used and short explanation at bottom of post.)\n\nTLDR: I have about 30 hours in this. At least glance through the pictures. The title is pretty much it if you're looking for the short route.\n\nAlso, there's some profanity in this. I'm pissed off.\n\nIn order to getting started, let's look at what's required to write put options;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/875dcfnh3ac71.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed2b2de45c28ec210dad3bac077f8f009866ea45\n\nEither the put options are wrote naked, or\n\nThe put options are covered, which means, the writer has a short position.\n\nWho the fuck is buying puts with a 50\u00a2 strike 2 years away when the stock is pushing $500? More on that point later but keep this in mind.\n\n\\#2 to understand my math;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmh2tdr30ac71.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc4faf0266437b8ad70655da478170f9fba5e44\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nTo explain how I did this math, use to above image. The candles at the bottom represent the volume and the \"floating candles\" represent the price.\n\nGiven that there may be buying and selling of these same options, I wanted to use the most conservative numbers I possibly could.\n\nIf a candle (example C) closed at a higher price, more options were bought than sold. That might mean that 750 were bought but it could also mean that just 501 were bought and 499 were sold during that time. The candle would be green in both cases if the price rose.\n\nI've taken all final totals and divided them by 2 in order to cut them in half to account for this (added as listed and later /2 when everything is totaled).\n\nAlso, the red candles represent selling and lower closing prices. For those volumes (D,F,G), rather than saying 1/2 the volume -1, I have added the value as 100% selling.\n\nTherefore, for D,F,G above, their totals given their volume as 100%.\n\nD = -300 rather than -151\n\nF = -400 rather than -201\n\nG = -250 rather than ~~-76~~ \\-126\n\nThe current option dates on the menu:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ap3owjui4ac71.png?width=155&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff46bbf3599c2f0f74fd805bad055f52ac74df7b\n\nLet's start with July 23, 2021 expiry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8difswzo4ac71.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=0704e81faf6b782b8d16753810c0681f901334db\n\nNothing too serious here. The lowest available strike prices for that date. First bought/sold early June.\n\n$10, $20, $30, $40 and $50 strikes. If covered, 276,100 short shares were used to create them. If naked, great for the writer. Premium in pocket. Nice!\n\nOn to July 30, 2021 expiry. $10, $20, $30, $40 and $50 strikes;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z0ox40w16ac71.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ebe0805a59d67e1ba92491c828437ae5ef7ac6\n\nBoring.... 42,400! The big numbers are coming but they aren't here.\n\nHere's the chart for the $10 strike;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z911srx76ac71.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=e54fa97bcc6fb9a93f22a2126531ed76193a48d3\n\nBeen trading just over a month and the biggest positive day was 139 option contracts.\n\n***August 6, 2021 and August 13, 2021 expiry aren't even worth dealing with.***\n\nAugust 20, 2021 expiry almost isn't either but here it is for those interested;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ug8u9wln6ac71.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac19406dec9ae8da198367546d754f53f7eb7dae\n\nWell, that's sort of something. 853,650 underlying shares represented within the bottom four strike prices. Been trading for about two months but hey. This isn't why we're here.\n\n***August 27, 2021, September 17, 2021 and October 15, 2021 expiry once again aren't worth it.***\n\nOk, BUCKLE THE FUCK UP from here on out. Shit's about to get wild.\n\nHere comes November ~~21~~,19, 2021 expiry ($3, $5, $8, $10 strikes. bottom 4 strike prices);\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc8upx3n7ac71.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ad257822c886a327e0c35e3b23ec0f78b332412\n\nHoly shit! That's a lot of shares represented within just the 4 lowest strike prices. 781,270 contracts traded on January 27, 2021 alone. 78,127,000 represented in one day. There's just over 76 million shares in existence. Must be another one of those glitches.\n\nA quick look at the chart for the $3 puts;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dy1d0q2xeac71.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=df5541f78495580e24068715960e239122707b43\n\nBusy day that January 27, 2021. Those were getting expensive. Good profits.\n\nMoving on. Let's look at January 21, 2022 expiry.\n\n**Two pictures** to catch all the trades. First started trading these bad boys December 9, 2019.\n\nThe strikes are getting pretty low for something this far out.\n\n[Pic 1, ](https://preview.redd.it/fhtvsn8y8ac71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f403d34495349d145bd1cf05b3cce5546a65afc)\n\n12.04 million contracts January 27, 2021!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrfy8x5n9ac71.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=01bd66dc756dd3bf3e5c5ab3805ac36f3bfae040\n\nThat's one hell of a lot of activity. Ok, fine, it's a long ways away and the strike prices are low. Best to plan ahead.\n\nWait! Where the fuck did they find 716,503,050 shares **(at minimum)** to back this sum bitch?\n\nA quick look at the chart for the 50\u00a2 puts;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vx10rtkafac71.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=963f1948a0f2885ab764208435241399b9bb603d\n\n12,040,000 options contracts (1,204,000,000 shares/ 1.2B) traded in one day, for one strike price, a year away from expiry?\n\nMoving on. Hold tight! The track ahead is pretty rough.\n\nJune 17, 2022. This right here, shows why these numbers are minimums.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0z1lygg6aac71.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5955190c5dc57e29690c9b2b337e6ff8ca12e9b\n\nMore faith in GME hitting $0.50 in one year than $50 the next summer? Also, it doesn't look like these have existed for very long.\n\nLast but not least, **January 20, 2023 expiry**. Started trading these strikes September 21,2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ed6rccydaac71.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=61fcc2b895f5e0ba979419ece4fa54add794a22f\n\nAgain, stupid activity January 27, 2021.\n\nThis graph is for the $2 puts. As you can see from the table above, there isn't really any interest in the $1 puts (only been trading a month now). Given everything else I've seen, I'm not sure why.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cyffrxszfac71.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d0a1aec983178d1ee942aec4467c4b3a6957866\n\n1,720,000 options contracts, traded in one day, for one strike price, two years away?\n\nJust in what I have here, (excluding June 17, 2022 expiry), there should be 868,902,550 shorted shares to back just what is shown in these examples. Of course, there's not because there isn't even that many in existence, UNLESS you're trying to hide something illegal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal message to Short Hedge Funds: I will sell one share when you ALL choose one of the following options;\n\n1. $ROPE\n2. $JUMP\n3. $JAIL\n\nThey're great tickers!\n\nPersonally, I want you to choose #3 and may you live forever but #1 and #2 are also acceptable. You're choice and FUCK YOU!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink and explanation:\n\nLink used: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1626998400&p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1626998400&p=GME)\n\nEach graph is available beside each strike price;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ff6dicyokac71.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=32203be513e7f50a6ef27f980bb455ea0e814c1e\n\nTo get here and see which contracts are available, start here from the pull down menu:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxam7n8blac71.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=94a0dc102f6615051e369f03f92548882ffbd117\n\nFlaired as Discussion.
