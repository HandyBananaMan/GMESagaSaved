Hey guys! It‚Äôs the Editor here. I will keep this simple. Life must go on. I feel more people read the daily news, just like me. The community gave me a lot and it‚Äôs time to give something back. I‚Äôll try to keep the news simple as well. I‚Äôll not give my opinion to any complicated issues and I‚Äôll simply leave it to the apes. I feel like my only responsibility is to post news here at least 2 to 3 days a week. Don‚Äôt expect every day.

None of this is financial advice.

Let me begin by flashing this in everyone‚Äôs eyes!
