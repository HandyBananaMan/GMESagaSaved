I expect no date. All I know is HFs are fucked. We are on the verge of a crash and the negative beta of GME makes it a safe heaven when that happens. On top of that I trust the transformation that is making Ryan Cohen and the DD for the MOASS is fucking solid. It is a no brainer. Not only I'm not selling shit but I'm buying more with each paycheck. GME is my new savings account.
