# Disclosure of a financial system which hides naked shorts by deleting shareholder votes.

# Meme-Stocks are actually, "Threshold Securities with Significant Public Interest."

# TLDR:

**Here we analyze Broadridge's over-voting prevention system which covers up evidence of rehypothecation and synthetic shares. When it comes to securities fraud, Market Makers are at risk of being exposed during each voting-season. They don't want the Public or the SEC to see any quantitative evidence of rehypothecation, I.E how far they've gone across the line in a security each year.**

**There are systems, technology, and policies in place since 2007 which allow securities fraud to expand further and further into illegal territory without the public finding out.**

**In essence, the following post reveals how DTCC struggles to keep track of who owns what because (A) it's an archaic system, and (B) many banks and brokers are liars.** 

**However, FINRA tries to track ownership by correlating FTD's with discrepancies in bank/broker reporting--I.E when a bank or broker's misrepresentation of short-interest can be substantiated, they are fined (I'm unclear when/if they are ever forced to cover).**

**DTCC, however, remains the authority on voter entitlement since Cede & Co. owns all the shares. It is likely using FINRA data (or its own assumptions) to decide which votes are safe to be deleted.**

**The SEC made this legal, and says you don't actually own your shares. In 2009 the SEC claimed that FTD's are the root cause of over-voting. Goes silent on the issue for 12 years.**

**An independent audit of Broadridge reveals the mechanism for deleting votes. The same Banks and Brokers who hide their short interest are either the ones who delete your votes, or give authorization to DTCC to automatically delete your votes. No voting-confirmation is provided to you, thus, rehypothecation does not reach the public eye through voter-disenfranchisement.**

**In short, they don't want YOU to know how much they short. But recent analysis by**  u/Criand  **and** u/AcedVector **reveals that the short interest on GME is still possibly higher than the float as of 6/25/2021.**

# Preface

In [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwktlt/overvoting_prevention_exposed/) we analyzed official comments to the SEC (as recent as 2019) from the industry's leading Vote Tabulators in regards to Proxy Over-Reporting and Over-Voting. These issues arise when **Beneficial Ownership** of real shares cannot be determined by subject matter experts.

We established a precedent for known issues in "Proxy Plumbing", and revealed that Broadridge has been the primary actor in detecting over-reporting since 2007.

We touched only lightly on the DTCC's role in obfuscating operational naked shorts, via bulk fungible accounting AKA **'Omnibus Proxy'**, and revealed that all roads lead back to the SEC.

In this article we analyze the SEC, DTCC, and Broadridge in greater depth to establish clarity around the process of hiding naked shorts from public view; and we determine whether this analysis truly suggests a connection between voter disenfranchisement and the market maker's abuse of phantom shares by analyzing the FINRA track record of Broadridge customers.

Some background from 2009: [https://csb.uncw.edu/people/moffettc/about/research%20papers/morphable%200109.pdf](https://csb.uncw.edu/people/moffettc/about/research%20papers/morphable%200109.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/zd6ajnilbi771.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc6cbb1632012a18efca0dd036aca094c1b223c0

We're interested in positions which are greater than a company's float because this implies that more votes can exist than shares outstanding--a heuristic of abusing loop holes in the system (Naked Shorting, Failures-to-Deliver (FTD's), Options misrepresentation, etc.) for operational advantage and/or financial gain.

Naked shorting provides a sort of decoupling of economic rights from beneficial ownership that becomes difficult to reconcile; meaning nobody knows exactly which shares are supposed to be allowed to vote, only that there are a known/unknown amount of FTD's.

The SEC, in their announcement of Regulation SHO, admitted existing cases where “delivery failures \[were\] greater than a company’s total public float.” Which is a documented admission of the extreme.

https://preview.redd.it/bh4kvzawbi771.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b344ec87bf1f8cb8a00d042f2c23e28a9e58c37

When a naked shorter sells you a share, by tradition of **Beneficial Ownership** you would be entitled to the voting right of that share. Yet, a corporation cannot tally more votes than shares issued. So when over-voting occurs, some shares have to be negated. How do you determine which votes don't count? Who decides if owning a share does not grant beneficial ownership of the voting rights? You are meant to be entitled to the voting power of your shares to give you agency in the value of your investment. Over time they stole this agency from you and your parents.

# Chapter 6: The Securities and Exchange Commission

[ The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a large independent agency of the United States federal government, created in the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The primary purpose of the SEC is to enforce the law against market manipulation. ](https://preview.redd.it/96hiu3sxbi771.png?width=249&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6b8b273c6b54751f26a12f5ed121fd20e8243f5)

It is important to remember that while the SEC is dubious, it is likely more negligent than villainous. Although both *could* be true, what makes the SEC different from the other bad actors is that the SEC discloses the bulk of its activity and reasoning while soliciting comments from the public. They actually have a 2-way street. Even if it is only a dirt road in a city of highways. Whether this is a redeeming modality, I leave up to the reader and those who actually comment to the SEC.

We might convey public opinion of the SEC by selecting a monochrome version of the SEC's logo. The United States Federal Seal bears a coat of arms whose colors represent:

* White: purity and innocence
* Red: hardiness & valor
* Blue: vigilance, perseverance &  justice

Now, let us begin.

In 2007 the SEC hosted a round table discussion on the topic of PROXY VOTING MECHANICS.

You can own it here:

[2007 screen grab of the panel in assembly.](https://preview.redd.it/99dyxl66ci771.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=8336a15e5333623b1ddf69a5a7d792dda6a89c01)

The first panel includes:

* Chevron Corporation - Lydia Beebe, Chief Governance Officer
* University of Texas - [Good Guy, Henry Hu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119907000168) \- Allan Shivers chair of law and banking and finance (and later an SEC employee before returning to university chair)
* Morgan Stanley - Rob O'Connor, Managing Director
* Merill Lynch - Ronnie O'Neill, VP
* Broadridge - Bob Schifellite, President of Investor Communications Solutions Group
* DTCC - Larry Thompson, General Counsel

For the purposes of today's analysis, this is a **dream team of representatives**. Unbridled, unfiltered, raw and uncut. In synopsis, **Chevron is suspicious of the proxy system** while Big Money defends its reputation. Henry Hu warns of system exploits while **Big Money slides the conversation.**

Despite another missed opportunity to do the right thing, there are important tidbits to be considered. In this meeting **Larry Thompson (DTCC) discloses the DTCC's process for reconciling votes**, by which we can ascertain the power dynamic of this situation:

>DTC is the record holder of all of those shares through CEDE & Co., and as I mentioned earlier. And as I said, all of that takes place electronically through our records. There are no identifiable shares that belong to any of our participants. They all belong to the name of ~~CDINCO~~ \[Cede & Co.\] and when a deposit is made at DTC, just as it's made in your commercial bank, you don't know which dollar is yours, you have a proportionate interest in that dollar. So do all of our participants have a proportionate interest in the shares that we hold in our vaults and which we control - Larry Thompson, DTCC 2007.

Because the shares at DTC are in a bulk fungible format, **they do not track who owns which share,** only that 10 shares are sold and 5 shares are bought, or 20 Fail-to-Deliver. This ownership is legal under the pretense of SEC Rule 13D-3.

# Chapter 7: The SEC says you don't own your shares.

[Yes, you read that correctly.](https://preview.redd.it/7bnco3j7ci771.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fb3ea6a7737691fc8cad0192e6c6a0c12dfb07)

[Pirates, thieves and cannibal warlords have similar ruling structures.](https://preview.redd.it/cilfxaf8ci771.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=10452faa29d06c2bdc32f45b71e693bc5274e7ed)

Fungi-bull-shit accounting is one of the reasons NFT's (Non-Fungible Tokens) will replace the fraudulent voting system, and why **Ryan Cohen is 4 steps ahead of the SEC** and a pioneer of his time.

Note: 13D is a reporting requirement for shareholders which own >5% of a company. Common practice is to hold <4.99% to evade reporting, and any excess is held in shell companies. Law Firm [Hunton & Williams describes this in more detail](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjCloSzvZrxAhXLxzgGHW8RBUcQFjAAegQIBRAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huntonak.com%2Fen%2Finsights%2Fsec-concludes-a-busy-week-of-beneficial-ownership-enforcement.html&usg=AOvVaw3GIGMT53oZdeTcNHuuw-LS). But before we diverge on the topic of vote manipulation, hostile takeovers, etc., the key takeaway is that **people do abuse this privilege**, and you do not legally own the voting rights to your shares.

**Voting rights are imparted to you at your Broker's, Bank's, and/or the DTCC's discretion**. For all intensive purposes, many shareholders will be allowed to vote, but no one is required (or perhaps able) to disclose whether your vote is actually counted. Many [(2009-2014) comments to the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410.shtml) address this issue.

Upon reviewing the comments, it's widely accepted that providing **"confirmation of vote"** back to the shareholder can help quantify the true pervasiveness of over-voting and aid in the reform of this and other proxy issues. Many industry experts advocate for some form of vote-confirmation. While some, curiously, advocate against vote-confirmation under the pretense of protecting shareholder privacy.

This is the SEC's response to the issue of Proxy Over-Voting:

# Chapter 8: The SEC sites 'Failures to Deliver' as primary cause of voting imbalance.

If no news is good news, then let's return to the SEC's 2009 [Concept Release on the U.S Proxy System](https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2010/34-62495.pdf):

https://preview.redd.it/ghhu2h6eci771.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bbd2ff28b009ba42396615df7c353c05733380d

So here's the **gut-shot of our whole premise.** In 2009, the SEC formally declared the root cause of over-voting was Failures-to-Deliver. **They had the leash in hand and could have wagged the dog**, but they remained silent for over a decade. 

SEC, Why so silent? You declared that the rights of investors were being sabotaged by players who stopped following the rules once they were losing. You asked for comments on the issue. You vowed to do something about it. You failed to meet that promise. 

Was the lack of attention toward FTD's and over-voting a sign of systemic corruption or was it fools being misled?

[The Public could hold the SEC accountable to explain whether it was misled by Broadridge and\/or corrupted by other Financial Industry Lobbyists.](https://preview.redd.it/j1736e5fci771.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=11216475e512cded704ef29d66fff3295095f621)

Hot dog, then let's hear it from the horse's mouth.

# Chapter 9: Broadridge is back with 2 Truths and a Lie.

[ Broadridge Financial Solutions is a public corporate services company founded in 2007 as a spin-off from Automatic Data Processing. The main business of Broadridge is as a service provider supplying public companies with proxy statements, annual reports and other financial documents, and shareholder communications solutions, such as virtual annual meetings. ](https://preview.redd.it/drr9ek8gci771.png?width=290&format=png&auto=webp&s=d750b3317a8c9db72d9fc2bd2a0ea323b9e612b9)

Broadridge explains over-reporting during the 2007 Proxy Voting Brief:

[Bob Schifellite, President of Investor Communications Solutions Group, Broadridge, 2007.](https://preview.redd.it/enjizjugci771.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f2e511d10014b83f0b895738c1c98e80a3093af)

If you're detecting a bit of cognitive dissonance, that's because it's there. Broadridge divulged a sample size where over-reporting was an incidental 1.79% above the float. But Reg-SHO determined that could be a lie.

https://preview.redd.it/01mfl5jpci771.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=e649c3fed862e6a5bd51238e1fe574cca61b08f8

>Compliance with Regulation  SHO began on January 3, 2005. Regulation SHO was adopted to update  short sale regulation in light of numerous market developments since  short sale regulation was first adopted in 1938 and to address concerns  regarding persistent failures to deliver and potentially abusive “naked”  short selling.

A security will be placed on the threshold list if it has a significant fail to deliver position for at least 5 business days. Notice that the number of over-shorted companies was still in the multi-hundreds when (and prior to) Broadridge disclosing the 1.79% statement. In fact, on May 24th 2007 when the testament was given, 300+ companies were still over-shorted and that number continued to rise until July, 2008.

https://preview.redd.it/hu8nuuirci771.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=7951389d602db9f6714c9f98c85b4421f774517f

[Final amendments to Reg SHO](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj0tqqXyZrxAhXo73MBHTF2DLEQFjAAegQIBRAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2Frules%2Ffinal%2F2008%2F34-58775.pdf&usg=AOvVaw02scg4dQzm4BPV8v3fwT1Q) were made on July 14, 2008, resulting in an abatement of reported threshold securities. But the dragon was only wounded. It was never truly slain, as indicated by the 2021 exposure of 'Meme-Stocks' which are actually...

#  "THRESHOLD SECURITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTEREST".

Say it with me again, "Meme-stocks are threshold securities with significant public interest."

Louder, MSM:

**MEME-STOCKS ARE THRESHOLD SECURITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTEREST.**

* Threshold Security = Bad for markets.
* Public Interest = Good for markets.
* Your move, 11-Week Gary Gensler.
* I'll give you a head start:

And, if you give Broadridge enough rope to hang themselves...

[You just can't trust anyone who uses the word, Tranche. Especially when they keep rounding down the number in an effort to feel some reprieve from the condemnation in their dishonesty.](https://preview.redd.it/a0fqljjsci771.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34fdea3738a9d975fa7085987378cdba38421caf)

When you listen to the transcript, it is evident that Mr. Schifellite is experiencing the all-too-human emotion of, "cat-got-your-tongue mid guilt-tripped lie". 

[Mr. Bob Schifellite wants you to believe there is only 0.33&#37; over-voting.](https://preview.redd.it/r600jc0vpi771.png?width=190&format=png&auto=webp&s=51e1911c5d64dd83def2374f706c843b20ef27bd)

Schifellite (Broadridge) lied to the SEC, and continues to lie for 12+ years. Okay, okay, "Absconds from telling the truth as to protect his client's interest's."

Either way, the SEC seems to have bought it hook, line and sinker because, well, 12+ years of inaction = 12+ years of perpetuity.

Remember, 0.33% is a very, very low number. **It's a "darling number" which affords a willing individual an excuse to not address the problem. (I.E cutting corners, quitting before the job's done, looking the other way, etc.)**

Broadridge is vouching for its product in front of regulators and subscribers. But is this number a true representation of actual over-voting; and shouldn't the SEC (and Broadridge, Financial Industry et. al.) be held to a higher standard for design of experiments? 

We have historical anecdotes from industry professionals, SEC coming out of the closet, and contemporary DD which all point toward exorbitant FTD's. 0.33% just seems like a cherry-picked example. AND THAT IS NOT HOW WE DO SCIENCE.

So if we can't trust the data, and there are [numerous complaints against Broadridge misrepresenting the data](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410.shtml), let's evaluate Broadridge's 2007 claim of 0.33% over-voting against some other indicator. How about the actions of [Broadridge's top \~10 clients](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1383312/000119312509194956/dex991.htm) from 2009 over the same (and relative) time period?

* note 1: this is not a complete list, we're focusing only a few examples of short interest, failure-to-deliver, and options manipulation. An exhaustive list, is well, exhausting. For our purpose of validating Broadridge's statement, we're targeting FINRA violations from 2005 forward.
* note 2: "positions" does not mean separate securities. Many of these (if not only some) were multiple positions in the same security as verified (with some consistency) by FINRA.
* note 3: "short interest misrepresentation" does not mean naked shorting, but it does imply they had a motive not to cover, some of these may have contributed to the SEC's threshold securities. But all, guaranteed, contributed to FTD's.
* note 4: I had wished to procure a list of Broadridge customers from 2007 (at the time of Mr. Schifellite's statement) but this proved difficult to obtain.

**In descending order, Broadridge' top performing clients from 2009:**

[ Tell me again, Mr. Bob Schifellite of Broadridge, how we arrived at only 0.33&#37; over-voting with all those revolving FTD's at the DTCC's bulk fungibus. ](https://preview.redd.it/8yf89a5qdi771.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f43abeef46c2ea6cdf0f6bbabe933b77fd7d553a)

So was it that Mr. Schifellite was disclosing a number which excluded all the FTD's? Or was it a sample size of non-threshold securities; maybe even threshold securities which didn't over-vote? Remember, at the time there were 100-300+ threshold securities year over year... (if anyone has more data on threshold securities between 2009-2020). 

Also, mind Broadridge's top client, Merill Lynch, which had **9 billion shares outstanding** in 2014 (That we knew about). Very liquid.

In essence, Broadridge's top 2009 clients have attempted to benefit from (and have been caught red-handed) in not disclosing their short interest and/or covering their FTD's. For years and years and years.

* This is illegal.
* This is market manipulation.
* Broadridge enables the market manipulation.
* SEC hasn't prevented the market manipulation for more than a decade.
* Has the SEC been bribed or persuaded that misrepresenting short interest and misrepresenting the shareholder votes is an industry best-practice?
* Can you be bribed or persuaded?
* Should this be allowed to continue happening?

**Okay, we see the evidence of rehypothecation and the accusations of vote cover-up. But is it real? How does FINRA validate that Broadridge's client's short interest has been repeatedly misrepresented over the past decade and beyond?**

Well, the only true control is in correlating each bank/broker's submitted report with a quantity of FTD's in the DTCC's bulk fungible accounts. I.E the fungible accounts are the source of truth and source of voting-power. 

In the 2007 round table, the panel provides a thousand excuses for not disclosing FTD's. You can pick any one of them. Some of my favorites are \[sic\]:

1. The system is working, don't question it.
2. We hazard to say that changing the system would yield unwanted consequences.
3. It would reveal the pervasiveness of the issue, but the issue is not pervasive.
4. It's just happening overseas, not in the good ole U.S.A.
5. It would expose the vulnerability of market participants, creating unfair advantage.
6. The DTCC did a good job of bringing us out of 1970 and into the modern era. Give them lots of credit to keep doing what they do.

If the DTCC was really formed to facilitate the transfer of securities from paper to electronic format, it seems to have stopped evolving alongside the world's technological cohorts at some point. 

If the die-hard proponents of this sloppy system chose THIS hill to fight on, and won't reveal the truth about how much money the banks and brokers are printing all the time, let the over-reporting be our compass of illumination. 

Broadridge is delighted to inform you that they are the one-stop-shop for over-reporting prevention, and also an independently-audited company! They boast about it on every shareholder report and comment to the SEC. But loose lips sink ships, and I am very happy to tell you that the independent audit does indeed surprise and delight.

# Chapter 10: Hello, my name is Independent Auditor, Deloitte.

[ Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, commonly referred to as Deloitte, is a multinational professional services network with offices in over 150 countries and territories around the world. ](https://preview.redd.it/tdq2dxl7gi771.png?width=299&format=png&auto=webp&s=743ca873d0d8d1270db51c9e12a69c42fc08eff5)

[In 2010, Deloitte provided an independent audit of Broadridge's IT systems](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-14-10/s71410-264.pdf). The methodology for relieving you of your votes is disclosed within section 13.1 of the report. This confidential report was provided by comment from Broadridge to the SEC, thus making it public information.

So let's get this straight. In their desperation to prove their credibility to the SEC, **Broadridge has inadvertently disclosed (to the Public) that it hides misrepresented short interest through vote count obfuscation.** The process is as follows:

1. Broadridge tells DTCC to provide **a special feed** for its subscribing client's accounts. (I.E the ones with all the FINRA violations for misrepresented short interest).
2. DTCC supplies a feed for Over-Vote Service Clients. (I.E **people who pay money to measure how close they've come to being quantitatively exposed for financial misconduct.)**
3. DTCC then provides a ***second feed*** which is **authorized** by the Corporation issuing the shareholder vote. (I.E smoke and mirrors for the patsy corporation/tabulator to sign-off, all legal-like to **authenticate the vote in spite of securities fraud.)**
4. Separate calculations are performed for each bank/broker's voting entitlement. (I.E **reconciling all the short interest misrepresentation** as best they can to ascribe reasonable entitlements **without being forced to cover** insurmountable and/or undesirable short interest).
5. The entire process exists with the express purpose of **warning the banks/brokers** who subscribe to Broadridge. (I.E the ones with all the FINRA violations, paying money to measure their public exposure without being forced to cover.)
6. In the event that over-voting is detected, the banks/brokers are given the opportunity to change their answer. (I.E **Lie to everyone about the obligations they don't want to/can't fulfill.**)
7. Deloitte audits the process and confirms that it is working. (As intended).
8. SEC pats itself on the back for doing some actual work in 2005. (PornHub founded May 25, 2007.) **SEC allows banks, brokers and Broadridge to run rampant with the public's money for 12+ years.**
9. ~~Profit.~~
10. **Moon.**

# Chapter 11: They're going to file for it.

One thing is for certain, and evidenced by all the action above. DTCC might fuck around, but it doesn't fuck *around*.

* All
* Shorts
* Must
* Cover

Even if they go kicking and screaming into the night. And they will TRY ANYTHING to evade this responsibility.

**Are Apes going to let them get away with it?**

* I think not. 
* At this stage, the DD will flow indefinitely and cannot be ignored. 
* Ignorance will be the SEC's and Politician's ammunition. 
* Hold them accountable. Don't be misinformed, they are accountable to you on every level. 
* Market Makers will concede to financial reform in order to evade criminal prosecution.

**There is a Chinese saying, "I hope you are not born into a time of change."**

* Well, Gen-X, Gen-Z, Gen-Y, Millenials, even Boomers...
* We were all born into it. Problems like this have persisted since the 1900's.
* But as of 2021, the financial industry has peaked. 
* The searchlight has been cast and now the cockroaches all scatter.

**In conclusion, let us recap the five key-narrative points which led us to this moment:**

1. **The DTCC and Broadridge enable the cover up.** And for this, they too shall answer. They're like two international arms dealers in Wallstreet's Financial War on the Heart of America. One supplies the guns, the other provides the ammo. But it was only ever about keeping the money laundering system in place for all the banks and brokers who pay homage.
2. **Many banks and brokers are the financial terrorists** who buy the guns and pull the trigger. They just got caught holding the smoking gun. One round left in the chamber.
3. **The SEC is the idiot diplomat** who needs your judgement, because they're hesitant to get involved due to Geneva convention and lack of intel, but they're kinda having to escalate the stakes and enter into sterner negotiations to get shit done before their centennial anniversary on June 6, 2034. (Tits stay jak for SEC reform.)
4. **The shareholders and the corporations are the victims.** (But not the Sarah Mclachlan Arms of an Angel kind of victims, they are the vindictive super hero who just discovered the extent of their new power). Their shares have been diluted, and the value can be driven down by an illegitimate excess in supply at any date and time of the bank's and/or broker's choosing. Also, we've been lied to and that will not go unpunished in the context of reform.
5. **No analyst can** ***truly*** **make an accurate guess as to the fundamentals of a security.** We're all playing cards with too many decks and the dealers want to shuffle your winning hand. But the card counting machine just blew up and the game is becoming more exposed until it's all out on the table. 

Anyway, buckle up and buy your holds. Enjoy the simulation.
