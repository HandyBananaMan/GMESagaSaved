<h1>Title: There is no move they can make that we can't see, nothing that they can hide that we can't find, nothing that they can do that we don't predict for. We aren't winning, we've won. We just have to wait for the prize.</h1>

<p>We have been and still are more than one step ahead of the short hedge funds.</p>
<p>Wanna hide your FTDs in deep ITM puts months off in the distance? Found you!
Wanna route your buys through dark pools to not affect price? Found you!
Wanna hide your Captial in offshore accounts? Found you!
Wanna stay up late preventing your demise? Well, they make that quite easily actually.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is that we have amassed the most knowledgeable group of apes and r'tards that can rip every single move of theirs to bits.</p>
<p>As always, expect fuckery, but they're out of options. It's been a can kick for months.</p>
<p>Just think, you've seen the clip, Citadel did everything they could to survive just one more day after 2008. They were fine in the run up till the markets crashed, just think how now they're bleeding to death. When the market pops, they are done for. Gone. Hedge funds are spiraling towards a financial black hole and GME is going to suck it all up.</p>
<p>This is the end for hedge funds, they've enjoyed a 40 year financial fuck fest of screwing the little guy. Not anymore.</p>
<p>How terrible of me, I forgot these</p>
