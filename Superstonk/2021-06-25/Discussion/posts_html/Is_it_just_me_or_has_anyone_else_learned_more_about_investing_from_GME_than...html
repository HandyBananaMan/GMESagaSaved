<p>Investing in GameStop wasn't the first stock purchase in my life, but it was THE investment that made me really learn about the market.  I'd learned the basics, maybe even a little more than the average novice, but GME ignited my desire to learn as much as I possibly could about the markets and investing </p>
<p>Everything about money aside, I'm incredibly grateful for the knowledge that's been shared here and on the other subs  GameStop has motivated me to become a much more educated investor and I know that's the last thing any shady ass hedgie would ever want.</p>
<p>Food stamps or lambos, baby!
