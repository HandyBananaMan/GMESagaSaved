<h1>Title: Remember the rumors of the May 17th margin call? Reverse Repos DECREASED and GME jumped 200% on T+5 (margin call deadline). Yesterday, margin calls via anytime SLD checks were enacted, the price is dipping, and Reverse Repos have DECREASED. HODL ONTO YOUR TITS</h1>

<p>I started thinking about reasons why RRPs decreased today, and then I was reminded of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nlzqvs/gamma_squeeze_alert_the_future_ahead/">post last month that predicted the price action from May 25th into June</a> and how it could've related to reverse repos. Essentially, i'm speculating that the reverse repos dipped today because someone got margin called and unless they satisfy their margin requirements within T+5, they will be forced to cover on July 5th. <strong>This means watch for dips in ETFs that last up to 6 days</strong> (T+5). The deadline for satisfying the <em>theoretical</em> margin call would be <strong>July 5th</strong>. Also, i'm currently reading through 002 to see if it throws a wrench in this idea.</p>
<p><strong><em>FOR THE LOVE OF GOD</em></strong> don't take my smooth-brained speculation as gospel. I just recognized some patterns and that's it. In all likelihood, it's all unrelated. That's my <em>no dates</em> disclaimer.</p>

<p>May 17th:</p>
<p>- <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD">RRPs decreased</a> \~$32 billion but gained 4 participants</p>
<p>- <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1394322533323837447?s=20">Mark Cuban tweets</a> ominously about margin calls</p>
<p>- MSM talks about margin call rumors</p>
<p>- Aggressive shorting keeps GME under $180 from April 6th, 2021 until May 17th - closing price: $180.60</p>
<p>- A dip and attempts to cover start from here to may 25th</p>
<p>May 25th:</p>
<p>- After T+5 days of an attempt to cover by closing other positions (dip in the SPY), they presumably fail and are forced to cover around the same time of the T+21 cycle</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>To clarify, there are <strong>74</strong> counterparties for RRP today and there were <strong>75</strong> yesterday.  Was a participant from yesterday margin called? Who's to say. The RRP decrease was \~<strong>$41 billion</strong>, well within the $80 billion limit.</p>
<p>Generously contributed by u/ravenouskit are the RRP values from the aforementioned dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>5/14, $241B</li>
<li>5/17, $209B</li>
<li>6/24, $813B</li>
<li>6/25, $771B</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I edited the shit out of the OP with better info. Might do it some more.</p>
