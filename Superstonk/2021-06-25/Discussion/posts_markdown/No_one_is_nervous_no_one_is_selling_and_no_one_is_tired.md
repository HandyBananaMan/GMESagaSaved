I know the apes who write the posts about not panicking and not setting dates etc etc have our best interests at heart, but at some point you got to realize that no one is nervous, no one is selling and no one is tired, and if they are... WE DON'T WANT THEM HERE!! Anyone who has come this far and is now wavering because of a few predictions that didn't come true are PAPER HANDS and we don't want them here. They will only hurt us during the MOASS so I say let them be scared and unsure and let them bail if they so choose. But flooding the feed with these virtuous posts about staying calm and not leaning into expectations is just annoying. I'm sorry if this an unpopular opinion but its starting to get out of hand.

Edit: Tired is referring to tired of holding out of fear of the MOASS not happening. But of course we are all very very tired of the bullshit and market manipulation, or late night video game sessions, both acceptable tired states.

Edit 2: Wow, this got way more attention then I expected, the shear amount of up-votes should be a clear indication that apes are front lining this battle and are absolutely pre-pared to go the distance.  LOVE YOU ALL
