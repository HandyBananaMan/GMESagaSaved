OMG people it can be sooooo easy. We know GME is shorted 100+%. So... just buy and hold and eventually  **ðŸš€**  **ðŸš€**  because shorting parties will break under the fees.

But no, we need to have these expectations when it is going to pop. Shareholder meeting, T+21, T+31, regulation passing, technical analysis, and of course f-ing HYPE WEEK.

Also, **apparently** we need to have price targets: exponential floor, Elliot wave theory, etc.

# Don't you see that all of this is just setting expectations!?!? And expectations only leave people disappointed

Just buy and hold and  **ðŸ’Ž** **âœ‹**
