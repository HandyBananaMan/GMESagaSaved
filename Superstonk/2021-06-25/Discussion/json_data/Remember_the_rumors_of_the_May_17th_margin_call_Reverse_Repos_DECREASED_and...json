    "selftext": "I started thinking about reasons why RRPs decreased today, and then I was reminded of a [post last month that predicted the price action from May 25th into June](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/nlzqvs/gamma_squeeze_alert_the_future_ahead/) and how it could've related to reverse repos. Essentially, i'm speculating that the reverse repos dipped today because someone got margin called and unless they satisfy their margin requirements within T+5, they will be forced to cover on July 5th. **This means watch for dips in ETFs that last up to 6 days** (T+5). The deadline for satisfying the *theoretical* margin call would be **July 5th**. Also, i'm currently reading through 002 to see if it throws a wrench in this idea.\n\n***FOR THE LOVE OF GOD*** don't take my smooth-brained speculation as gospel. I just recognized some patterns and that's it. In all likelihood, it's all unrelated. That's my *no dates* disclaimer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMay 17th:\n\n\\- [RRPs decreased](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD) \\~$32 billion but gained 4 participants\n\n\\- [Mark Cuban tweets](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1394322533323837447?s=20) ominously about margin calls\n\n\\- MSM talks about margin call rumors\n\n\\- Aggressive shorting keeps GME under $180 from April 6th, 2021 until May 17th - closing price: $180.60\n\n\\- A dip and attempts to cover start from here to may 25th\n\nMay 25th:\n\n\\- After T+5 days of an attempt to cover by closing other positions (dip in the SPY), they presumably fail and are forced to cover around the same time of the T+21 cycle\n\n*Keep your tits inside the vehicle at all times.\ud83d\ude80*\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nTo clarify, there are **74** counterparties for RRP today and there were **75** yesterday.  Was a participant from yesterday margin called? Who's to say. The RRP decrease was \\~**$41 billion**, well within the $80 billion limit.\n\nGenerously contributed by u/ravenouskit are the RRP values from the aforementioned dates:\n\n* 5/14, $241B\n* 5/17, $209B\n* 6/24, $813B\n* 6/25, $771B\n\nAlso, I edited the shit out of the OP with better info. Might do it some more.",
    "title": "Remember the rumors of the May 17th margin call? Reverse Repos DECREASED and GME jumped 200% on T+5 (margin call deadline). Yesterday, margin calls via anytime SLD checks were enacted, the price is dipping, and Reverse Repos have DECREASED. HODL ONTO YOUR TITS",
