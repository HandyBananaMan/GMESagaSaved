So... just buy and hold and eventually  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  because shorting parties will break under the fees.\n\nBut no, we need to have these expectations when it is going to pop. Shareholder meeting, T+21, T+31, regulation passing, technical analysis, and of course f-ing HYPE WEEK.\n\nAlso, **apparently** we need to have price targets: exponential floor, Elliot wave theory, etc.\n\n# Don't you see that all of this is just setting expectations!?!? And expectations only leave people disappointed\n\nJust buy and hold and  **\ud83d\udc8e** **\u270b**",
