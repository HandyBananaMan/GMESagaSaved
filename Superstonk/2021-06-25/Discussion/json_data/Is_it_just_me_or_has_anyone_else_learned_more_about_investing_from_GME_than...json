    "selftext": "Investing in GameStop wasn't the first stock purchase in my life, but it was THE investment that made me really learn about the market.  I'd learned the basics, maybe even a little more than the average novice, but GME ignited my desire to learn as much as I possibly could about the markets and investing \n\nEverything about money aside, I'm incredibly grateful for the knowledge that's been shared here and on the other subs  GameStop has motivated me to become a much more educated investor and I know that's the last thing any shady ass hedgie would ever want.\n\nFood stamps or lambos, baby!\n\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude80",
