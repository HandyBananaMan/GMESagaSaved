Found you!\nWanna route your buys through dark pools to not affect price? Found you!\nWanna hide your Captial in offshore accounts? Found you!\nWanna stay up late preventing your demise? Well, they make that quite easily actually.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that we have amassed the most knowledgeable group of apes and r'tards that can rip every single move of theirs to bits.\n\nAs always, expect fuckery, but they're out of options. It's been a can kick for months.\n\nJust think, you've seen the clip, Citadel did everything they could to survive just one more day after 2008.

Hedge funds are spiraling towards a financial black hole and GME is going to suck it all up.\n\nThis is the end for hedge funds, they've enjoyed a 40 year financial fuck fest of screwing the little guy.
