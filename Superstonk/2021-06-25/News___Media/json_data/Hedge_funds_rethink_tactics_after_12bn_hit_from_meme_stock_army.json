In recent weeks, these stocks have staged a second rally, with a rise in stocks including cinema chain AMC inflicting yet more pain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Hedge fund losses since the start of the year from betting against just GameStop, AMC and Bed Bath & Beyond total more than $12bn, according to data group S3, while bets against a number of others have each run up additional losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. More than half short sellers\u2019 $5.1bn of losses betting against AMC this year have come in June.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The heavy toll shows how moves by individual investors, which are regularly co-ordinated on forums such as r/WallStreetBets, has heightened the risks for professional investors in the Wall Street equities market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cIn two waves, a few hedge funds have seen modestly sized short positions turn into extinction-level events,\u201d said Andrew Beer, managing member at investment firm Dynamic Beta Investments. Funds that suffer multiple rounds of losses on short bets \u201cwill face difficult questions from investors as to whether their risk management failed to adapt to a changed market environment\u201d.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzozk2aw5f771.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73b9e22488452c5f0e56f2c35966b9b4bde6a97\n\n>The highest-profile hedge fund casualty has been Melvin Capital, which lost 53 per cent in January and is still down 44.7 per cent this year to May. Light Street Capital, the fund led by \u2018Tiger cub\u2019 alumnus Glen Kacher, was also hit early this year and again in May, with losses in the first quarter predominantly driven by soured short bets. London-based White Square Capital, which lost money shorting GameStop, is also shutting its main fund.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>An index compiled by Goldman Sachs of stocks favoured by retail investors has almost doubled since June 2020, while another that tracks companies that are targeted by short sellers has gained 28 per cent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Traders across the industry, both those caught directly in abrupt rallies in heavily shorted stocks as well as those hit by the ensuing market volatility, have now been forced to start tracking potential retail investor manoeuvres, or risk huge losses and backlash from their investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cThe danger is you don\u2019t really know what stock the retail community is going to go after next,\u201d said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. \u201cThere is not a stock that is \u2018safe\u2019.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Wu Silverman had typically concentrated on advising institutional clients about their hedging strategies. Now hedge funds seek her help to identify the early warning signs of a retail-driven meme stock surge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cIt has completely upended our markets, and we have had to make really dramatic changes to how we model things and how we manage risk,\u201d she said. Retail investors chasing volatility \u201chas gotten to the point where you can\u2019t ignore it\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Losses inflicted by retail investors have proved a rude awakening to hedge funds, which had just enjoyed a banner year in 2020 making their biggest gains since the aftermath of the financial crisis, according to HFR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Some funds are considering taking a greater number of smaller short positions to cut down on the potential losses a single stock can cause, say industry insiders. D1 Capital, whose founder Daniel Sundheim previously worked at Viking, is one fund that has been considering reducing the size of short bets this year, say people familiar with the strategy. Others are looking at betting against indices, rather than individual stocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Managers in the US and UK have begun using algorithms to scour forums such as r/WallStreetBets or other data sources to try to spot co-ordinated buying. While the practice is new to most western funds, this kind of surveillance is already common for many Asian managers, according to Patrick Ghali, managing partner at advisory firm Sussex Partners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tiger cub Lee Ainslie\u2019s Maverick Capital wrote to investors in April that its quant team \u201cnow systematically monitors Wall Street Bets and other similar forums that cater to less experienced, retail investors\u201d. Moez Kassam, chief investment officer at Anson Funds in Toronto, said his firm has been building algorithms to follow commentary and sentiment on Reddit, as well as using some bought from external companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Fintech company S3 now provides a company\u2019s \u201cshort squeeze risk\u201d score to Bloomberg terminal users, while alternative research provider Quiver Quantitative scrapes Reddit investment threads for ticker mentions and sentiment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cYou don\u2019t want your book to be exposed to the whims of r/WallStreetBets,\u201d said Quiver founder James Kardatzke.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Data group Sentifi, which buys data from the likes of Reddit and Twitter and uses it to score sentiment around stocks, said it detected a nearly 1,200 per cent rise in chatter around AMC between May 20 and June 1. The cinema chain\u2019s shares had already started to rise by then, but then doubled on June 2. Sentifi said the number of customers using its platform had doubled over the past year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Swiss investment firm Unigestion has also started looking at how it can deploy its machine reading and data techniques \u2014 which it already uses to spot changing sentiment \u2014 around meme stocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cIt is an important, though short-term, risk factor\u201d in markets, said Unigestion portfolio manager Salman Baig. \u201cFor us, any factor that can disrupt markets is of primary concern.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Additional reporting by Miles Kruppa  \n>  \n>[laurence.fletcher@ft.com](mailto:laurence.fletcher@ft.com), [madison.darbyshire@ft.com](mailto:madison.darbyshire@ft.com)\n\nEdit: changed paragraph spacing to make it more mobile friendly",
