<p>Good evening Diamond Handers!!</p>
<p>As part of GameStop's efforts to expedite their deliveries and expand their product lines on the East Coast, they've leased out a 700,000 SQ Ft. center in York, PA (This is also my hometown, JTTT). Yes, this information has already been disseminated, but here's an update! The hiring event for their Day One team will begin on July 8th. Their listing outlines the direct benefits employees will receive, which if you ask me, seems like they really care about their employees AND making customers happy!</p>
<p>What better way to compete with an E-Commerce giant than to attack them where they're weak? Customer Support &amp; Employee Relations!</p>
<p>Here's the contents of their job listing:</p>

<p><em>Edit: I did some extra dorky math for y'all.</em> The average GameStop store is 1,700 Sq Ft(taken from their 2017 annual report). This means you could fit roughly 411 GameStop's inside of this facility or 8.5% of the GameStop's in existence ;). IT'S BIG. </p>
