*Note: Mods, this would be a Data flair, please and thank you for all you do*.

There's a trending post today about their[Â office activity being a crucial datapoint we have](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7kcy4/citadels_office_activity_is_a_rare_and_crucial/).

If you want a healthy dose of confirmation bias on how many people are at Citadel after-hours...

I've been doing some food delivery in the Loop (CBD of Downtown Chicago), never starting before 5pm CDT. I always get deliveries to Citadel Center (the name of the whole building).

In the past 2 weeks, they've moved from leaving deliveries at the visitor desk to having a person whose entire job is watching a cart of revolving order drop-offs and pick-ups. During the 60 seconds I run in/out of the building I see multiple people dropping off food orders. Picking up from nearby businesses I see people in their Citadel Securities fleece vests who have gone out for a quick takeout dinner.

Now, this is a huge building that's probably full of many businesses, but you should know, from the ground... they really *are* busy in the evening.
