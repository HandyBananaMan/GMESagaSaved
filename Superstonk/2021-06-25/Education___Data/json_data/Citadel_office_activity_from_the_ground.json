I always get deliveries to Citadel Center (the name of the whole building).\n\nIn the past 2 weeks, they've moved from leaving deliveries at the visitor desk to having a person whose entire job is watching a cart of revolving order drop-offs and pick-ups. During the 60 seconds I run in/out of the building I see multiple people dropping off food orders. Picking up from nearby businesses I see people in their Citadel Securities fleece vests who have gone out for a quick takeout dinner.\n\nNow, this is a huge building that's probably full of many businesses, but you should know, from the ground... they really *are* busy in the evening.\n\n---\n\n***This is not financial advice!***  \n*This post was **anonymously** submitted via **[www.superstonk.net](https://www.superstonk.net/)** and reviewed by our team.\nSubmitted posts are unedited and published as long as they follow r/Superstonk rules.*",
