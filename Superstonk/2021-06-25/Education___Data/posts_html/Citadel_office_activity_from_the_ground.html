<p>There's a trending post today about their<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7kcy4/citadels_office_activity_is_a_rare_and_crucial/">Â office activity being a crucial datapoint we have</a>.</p>
<p>If you want a healthy dose of confirmation bias on how many people are at Citadel after-hours...</p>
<p>I've been doing some food delivery in the Loop (CBD of Downtown Chicago), never starting before 5pm CDT. I always get deliveries to Citadel Center (the name of the whole building).</p>
<p>In the past 2 weeks, they've moved from leaving deliveries at the visitor desk to having a person whose entire job is watching a cart of revolving order drop-offs and pick-ups. During the 60 seconds I run in/out of the building I see multiple people dropping off food orders. Picking up from nearby businesses I see people in their Citadel Securities fleece vests who have gone out for a quick takeout dinner.</p>
<p>Now, this is a huge building that's probably full of many businesses, but you should know, from the ground... they really <em>are</em> busy in the evening.</p>
