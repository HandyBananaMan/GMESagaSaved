# Title: I tried to find a banaya cat online at Game stop but they were all sold out. I went to my local Game stop because online it showed 1 left so I went there and after digging in the back room for 20 minutes they came up with it. So I went to 5 guys next door and bought them each a 10 dollar gift card.
