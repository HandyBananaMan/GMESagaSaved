I’ve seen a lot of comments, posts, and memes to suggest that the recent focus on the companies listed above is some type of deflection or the work of shills. I don’t think that could be further from the truth. 

Shills aren’t doing deep dives into the other major players in this. That’s ridiculous. Please don’t try and write off these deep dives as some type of FUD or forum sliding.

The more people who realize who is on the other side of this thing besides Citadel, the better. Shoot SUS operates nearly 20x the assets that Citadel does. And Point72 has a pretty well established playbook on how they operate (plus Steven A Cohen is a grade A asshole who openly mocked retail traders in January. He is the worst of the worst). These are really important things to be aware of and gives an array of additional SHF to monitor as closely as people have been with Citadel. 

Now, I know Citadel is a market maker so therefore should have a little bit more focus, but Virtu is also a MM and is yet another nefarious actor in all of this. 

There is no deflection behind this rise in interest in other organizations beyond Citadel and Melvin, just great info being shared.
