Apes of the world, lend me your ears!

I may be as smooth-brained as they come, but even I understand that this rocket is only activated with one strategy: BUY AND HODL.

Why? Because buying and hodling is the one play that has no downside or counterstrategy to it. The stock goes up? BUY AND HODL. Stock goes down? BUY AND HODL. Easy!

While option plays can promise huge short term profits and could indeed help pave the way up by creating gamma squeeze inertia, they can also be used against apes to collect hundreds of millions of free dollars when we set dates for ourselves and use our money on risky option plays rather than on shares.

The past month or so a popular former Superstonk mod and Youtuber has been encouraging people  in his Discord server to follow his option plays, hyping them up and basically calling them free money.

First he did so with July 16 800s as a post earnings play, then this week with June 25 250s as a T+21 play. Unfortunately, dozens of people followed him into this play, and ended up taking massive losses from it.

One guy even sold 250 shares - half of his position - and put it all into these failed call options.

Now, I understand the temptation to make these plays and earn a buttload of tendies if indeed some of the predictions and theories posted here come true. That money can then be used to buy even more shares and get even more tendies when we moon. It's the perfect scheme.

Except it's not.

SHFs know our dates. They have been manipulating the price to have options expire worthless countless times. They are not going to make it easy for apes. And every time your options expire worthless, guess who is getting even more ammo to fight apes in this war?

If an ape truly believes in the MOASS, he BUYS AND HODLS. He is not greedy, he is not impatient. BUY AND HODL is the ONLY weapon that cannot misfire against apes.

BUY AND HODL IS THE WAY!

This is NOT financial advice, I once accidentally ate a cockroach thinking it was a chocolate covered cockroach, but it wasn't! If you want to play options do it, it's your money. I will stick to BUYING and HODLING because I believe in the MOASS and know that there are more tendies than I'll ever need or know what to do with waiting on the other side of it.

TDLR: Buy and Hodl and wait. If you hodl it, it will squeeze!
