    "selftext": "Sharing this video of Krystal and Saagar giving an excellent criticism on this nonsense Bloomberg article that makes the argument that America SHOULD become a nation or renters. They also get into things like housing being the number one way to accumulate generational wealth, BlackRock buying up the housing market (apes know why)  and potential homebuyers either giving up or being forced to be overly competitive and pay insane prices for houses \u201cas is\u201d that, in some cases are coated in piss and shit.  \n\nDoesn\u2019t matter what anyone\u2019s political ideologies are, that\u2019s unacceptable. We need more agency in this game. I\u2019m lucky enough to have found a good, affordable house a few years ago but I\u2019d be screwed trying to find one in the same area and same cost now.  I hold for those apes who will use their diamond hands to plant that seed money for their first home that they absolutely fucking deserve. \n\n\nHere\u2019s this shitty Bloomberg article they criticize\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-17/america-should-become-a-nation-of-renters\n(Paywall but I was able to open by using a different browser)\n\nHere\u2019s the Breaking Points episode clip (full thing is about Housing)\nhttps://youtu.be/OIXkeYYum6k\n\nSorry if this breaks the no politics rule. I like that rule and will gladly take it down if so. It\u2019s a political show but this clip isn\u2019t about standard politics, just about how he middle class and poor are being squeezed out of the housing market. I just want to squeeze back. I just like the stonk. Not financial advice\n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf16",
