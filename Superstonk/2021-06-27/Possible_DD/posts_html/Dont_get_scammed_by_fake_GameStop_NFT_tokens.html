<p>Hey apes,</p>
<p>There has been a lot of tit jacking (mine included) about the possibility of GameStop NFT token being released. Please familiarize yourselves with the NFT by reading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o933f5/crypto_hints_being_dropped_in_gmes_prospectus/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">this post</a> by u/loggic.</p>
<p>Now... calm your tits. Why? <strong>An ape just got scammed.</strong></p>
<p>Ruh roh!!!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o99ms3/stay_calm_but_i_think_the_nft_is_now_available_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">a post</a> of an ape celebrating their own <em>got scammed</em> experience.</p>
<p>How'd they get scammed? Someone made a token and called it GameStop. But it wasn't GameStop. So jack your tits smartly.</p>
<p>Here's <img alt="the scam" src="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o9967o/gme_just_transferred_42069_gmetoken_to_itself_on/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share" /> in action again. </p>
<p>You think scammers don't know our memes? Hedgies know our memes... they're scammers. This coin world (won't say the banned word) is notorious for scams. Watch out for scammers.</p>
<p>Here's an important comment on that last post by u/Lucent_Sable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you sure that the participants in the transaction are Gamestop? </p>
<p>The from address in that transaction is  
0x133742073133c9aecdEC3a87e475C2945f23D6C0 </p>
<p>While the contract address is  
0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e </p>
<p>Additionally, the contract for the "GME" that this address sent is  0x5b7d043EcB3a694069CC01e763159ea1bdE0541d </p>
<p>which is not familiar at all. </p>
<p>To me it looks like someone spent some time and money to specifically craft an address where the first seven digits line up with what we find easily recognisable (1337420), but the similarities stop there. </p>
<h1><strong>I would treat this as suspicious until official confirmation from Gamestop comes out.</strong></h1>
<p>edit: More suspicious, if you look at the contract from the offical Gamestop NFT hype site, you can see that the official token is "Game<strong>s</strong>top (GME)", while the token that was transferred was "Game<strong>S</strong>top (GME)". This further confirms that they are actually different things that have just been set up to look similar at first glance.</p>

<p>So what should you do?!?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Jack your tits responsibly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for GameStop to announce the real NFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a breath before you buy on hype. Why? <strong>Make sure your spendies lead to tendies, unlike these apes.</strong></p>
