<p>Wow. This is fucking mind blowing. A woman come on to talk about finances. She was talking about recent retail investors and reddit so she brought a analyst on. He talked about shorts and "that bullshit movie stock" Her name is Hillary Cramer. Odd. Cramer. And he basically went on to talk about what's happening with Gamestop and the others. He said "companies like GME have been labeled as meme stocks but they have grown beyond that. They aren't memes anymore." </p>
<p>She continued to cut him off and talk about other "short squeezed" companys and kept saying it's all meme stocks. Even here the FUD is real. Keep fucking calling it a meme. I'll laugh to the bank with meme money...simulation confirmed</p>
<p>Edit: wow. I cant believe this community. I brag to friends and people about how amazing yall are and they still fail to understand. This is a revolution. And guess what. It will not be televised. Love you all you fucking beautiful retards.</p>
