<p>Hey Apes,</p>
<p>I want to see if we can get a full list of what Point72 and Citadel owns, with proof. If we can provide a clear and concise list of what these companies own that effect the media and decision making of the public, we can make this much more publicly available and widespread through social media outlets.</p>
<p>I want to show everyone that doesn't yet know that their favorite news channel or stock trading site that sways them to buy and sell and different stocks while also influencing their everyday purchases is actually partially controlled by big money firms.</p>
<p>See those Nestle and Unilever graphs charts that float around that show what they have their hand in and how it affects us ?</p>
<p>Lets make one. Make it pretty, make it TIL Fact, an " interesting as fuck " post..lets get it to the masses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
