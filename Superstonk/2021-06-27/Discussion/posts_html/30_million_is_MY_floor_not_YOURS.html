<p>I've seen a lot of people thinking 30million per share is not possible and it's fucking pissing me off. Their argument is always the same: Not enough money, Fed will stop it, be realistic, blablabla. There is no valid point they can tell you. This is FUD.</p>
<p>Here's what I think: You do you. Just don't regret selling too early.</p>
<p><strong>Not everyone will sell at the same time</strong>. I will just continue holding since I know such numbers in the millions are possible because of the infinite squeeze. More than 100% of the float shorted -&gt; HF buys a share -&gt; gets canceled against a naked short/synthetic share -&gt; People diamond hand -&gt; Infinity squeeze. It's as simple as that.</p>
