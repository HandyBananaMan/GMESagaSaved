<p>Last weeks, GameStop suddenly seems to offer so much more stuff, and they seem to add another category each week. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Board games</li>
<li>Candy</li>
<li>Action figures</li>
<li>Sport collectables</li>
<li>Vinyl records</li>
<li>"Lifestyle" stuff (mugs, lamps etc.)</li>
<li>Extended accessory offering</li>
<li>Extended offering PC hardware</li>
<li>Extended T-shirt offering</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is a very very smart way to leverage their global brand recognition and loyal following they got in the last couple of months. Imagine all apes buying their shit at GameStop instead of other companies, what a potential that could be for the company!</p>
<h1>To all apes, really take a look at their website <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/">it is amazing: https://www.gamestop.com/</a></h1>
<h1>I am certain GameStop will shatter next earnings  ðŸš€ ðŸš€</h1>
