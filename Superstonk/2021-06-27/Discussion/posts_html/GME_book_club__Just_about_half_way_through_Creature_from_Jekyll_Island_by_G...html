<p>Don’t get it twisted, my smooth brain can barely read so I got this bitch on audible and listen to it while I make crayon smoothies (only orange crayons for me chief). Now I can’t tell if it’s the brain freeze from the smoothie or if the information I’m learning about the banking system and the federal reserve is giving my polished smooth brain some wrinkles.</p>
<p>It’s actually pretty insane to think that we are in a ripple that was created at the beginning of the current banking cartel system. All of the information I’ve learned about the stock market, banking, and the economy has really helped me to understand what is going on in this book. </p>
<p>It’s been a really fun journey so far. Ape no fight ape, ape help ape. I’ve been helped by many apes, maybe I can help fellow apes one day too.</p>
<p>As scary as the world of banking, the Fed, and insiders can be, I know that I can buy and I can hold and apes together strong</p>
<p>Power to the players!</p>
<p>So my fellow smooth brains and wrinkly brains alike, do yo have any other book recommendations to get us through sideways trading days, drama filled weekends, or just something to read by the beach after MOASS?</p>
