You guys are thinking to small.  GameStop releases a etherium clone with 10 coins for every share.  All GameStop holders install app and redeem their code to receive coins.  Shorts are fucked.

But now GameStop has the world's most widely adopted crypto currency.  That can support other coins, contracts, represent shares.  

But being the god Ryan Cohen is he doesn't stop their, he moves gamestops shares to his crypto coin, and legitimizes it even further.  Opening the door for other company's to do the same.  

Giving way to a new wall street called GameStop, crypto and trading.  

Cause that's how I would finish an end boss.  Why just destroy them when you can rebuild what they have in a new form.  Not just hurting them once, but forever changing the game for them.
