I’ve been thinking about how GameStop is adding all sorts of new merchandise in various categories. I am a 3D printing and Arduino nerd so it occurred to me. What if GameStop started selling things for the “makers” in us. A lot of 3D printing is used for tabletop gaming or making little nerdy trinkets anyways. And Arduino/RPi is just legos for computer nerds in my opinion. There are very few retailers in the US that sell these. Most people I know (myself included) buy all this from the big ass river company, because that’s pretty much the only place that sells them outside of small niche stores. What do you guys think?

Edit: *Raspberry Pi (sorry, I’m hungry)
