I've seen a lot of people thinking 30million per share is not possible and it's fucking pissing me off. Their argument is always the same: Not enough money, Fed will stop it, be realistic, blablabla. There is no valid point they can tell you. This is FUD.

Here's what I think: You do you. Just don't regret selling too early.

**Not everyone will sell at the same time**. I will just continue holding since I know such numbers in the millions are possible because of the infinite squeeze. More than 100% of the float shorted -> HF buys a share -> gets canceled against a naked short/synthetic share -> People diamond hand -> Infinity squeeze. It's as simple as that.
