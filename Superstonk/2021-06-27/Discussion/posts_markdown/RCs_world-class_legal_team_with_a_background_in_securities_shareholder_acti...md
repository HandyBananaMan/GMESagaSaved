Ninche60 Edit: I believe in two of their bios it talks about advising hedge funds. To me that screams they can advise RC on what the hedge funds are doing and the best tactics to fight against them.

Ninche60 Edit 2: Wanted to add I got this info from going back and looking thru DFV’s old tweets. There is some golden info in those old ones if you go thru them. This one in particular he had tweeted about Ryan Nebel being the lawyer listed in on 13F
