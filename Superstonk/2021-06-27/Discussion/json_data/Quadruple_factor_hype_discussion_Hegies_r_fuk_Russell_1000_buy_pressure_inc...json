    "selftext": "What do you all think about the 4 factors? \n\nI know there should be a fair bit of buying pressure coming from the Russell 1000 index especially from the ETFs. I believe this alone will cause at least a 5% positive movement.\n\n\nI think we will see the T 21 spike come because the FTDs always have waited for the incoming price movement, mentioned above to be completed, they will try to drive the price down again once it settles. They have one last chance to break these rules. Why?\n\nThe implementation of Rule 002 will mean that the fckery that has been going on, for the most part unhindered will have to stop now. Now there is a rule against it. Simples.\n\nI see that THE STOCK THAT I LIKE has become fashionable on THAT SUB once again. This is positive for price no matter the reason for its regained popularity. Whether they have been reading the DD, watching the ATM share offering disappearing in a puff of smoke (5 days), are excited by the points above or a post just got a lot of traction, the fact is they've 10 million members.\n\nI think the THAT SUB factor is crucial as it will drive a human instinct that 10 years of training in a Shaolin Temple cannot crush. \n\n#FOMO\n\n\nThere will also no doubt be a large hit rate on other social media platforms as this craze begins to recraze. I believe however that there may be an almost unstoppable force about to help us smash through a fair few resistance levels this week and I'm not a mystic, but $483 is definitely within my sights within the next 2 weeks. I also believe that if we do get anywhere near $483 with all my DIAMOND HANDED ( March 10th hardened) HODLERs that we may just have reached the event horizon.\n\n\nThis is not financial advice. I'm currently inhaling the steam from a cauldron full of green crayons roasting on a fire under the railway fridge under which I reside.",
