    "selftext": "Putting together the pieces, I think we're looking at much more than a crypto dividend.  I think they're going to do the first ever crypto split.\n\nSay there are 70 million class A shares 'in existence'.  Create 70 million class B shares and issue them as a dividend.  Issue .01 class B share yearly as a dividend to every Class A share.\n\nNow, agree to trade either 1 class B share for 100 GME coin, or 100 GME coin for 1 class B share.\n\nNow, start selling a huge variety of retail items, and accept GME coin for transactions.  Every sale is a rube-goldbergian stock buyback.\n\nPrice of class B shares is pegged to company value.  Price of Coins is pegged to global purchasing power.  Global purchasing power is pegged to company value.\n\nCompany takes a small rake from every coin transaction, public or private, and issues them as dividends to class B shareholders.  Class B holders become the new de facto world bankers.  Class A shares generate new class B shares which are convertible to coins at a yearly hard-coded rate of 1% inflation.\n\nAnd boom, GME shares become the new world currency while all apes become super rich and economies (while they do crash) convert to using GME and are able to at least facilitate the flow of money in a way USD no longer can.\n\nWorld.  Currency.",
