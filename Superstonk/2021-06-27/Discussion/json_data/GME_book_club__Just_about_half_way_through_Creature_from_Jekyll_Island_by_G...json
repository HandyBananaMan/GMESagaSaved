    "selftext": "Don\u2019t get it twisted, my smooth brain can barely read so I got this bitch on audible and listen to it while I make crayon smoothies (only orange crayons for me chief). Now I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the brain freeze from the smoothie or if the information I\u2019m learning about the banking system and the federal reserve is giving my polished smooth brain some wrinkles.\n\nIt\u2019s actually pretty insane to think that we are in a ripple that was created at the beginning of the current banking cartel system. All of the information I\u2019ve learned about the stock market, banking, and the economy has really helped me to understand what is going on in this book. \n\nIt\u2019s been a really fun journey so far. Ape no fight ape, ape help ape. I\u2019ve been helped by many apes, maybe I can help fellow apes one day too.\n\nAs scary as the world of banking, the Fed, and insiders can be, I know that I can buy and I can hold and apes together strong\n\nPower to the players!\n\nSo my fellow smooth brains and wrinkly brains alike, do yo have any other book recommendations to get us through sideways trading days, drama filled weekends, or just something to read by the beach after MOASS?",
