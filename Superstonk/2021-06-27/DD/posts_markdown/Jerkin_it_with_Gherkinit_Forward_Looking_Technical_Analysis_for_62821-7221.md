Hello Superstonk!

Welcome to another weekend's forward looking Technical Analysis with your favorite pickle dude u/gherkinit

We are gonna go over some of the Technical Indicators I will be paying attention to this week and discussing some of the other factors that may effect GME this week.

As always I will post a consolidated [Video DD of this on my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial) for those of you that don't have the time to read through this, or have reading comprehension issues. This should be uploaded by 9pm EDT.

# Part I: Technical Analysis

**Cup & Handle and Supporting Indicators**

As you know if you've been following along, I have been tracking a cup & handle formation on the 1D timescale. I will state that on it's own a cup & handle can be pretty unreliable but since then I have found a few other indications that this one is at least somewhat accurate.

1. The indicator is formed over 3 months
2. The peaks of the "cup" are by volume traded at the exact same resistance level
3. The cup & handle formation is supported by an ascending triangle
4. That ascending triangle is reinforced by an uptrend

These combined indicators leave us with something like this

Generally when doing technical analysis I prefer to look for support indicators that back up my main thesis. That is what I have done here.

If we zoom in on our current price action we have stayed well within the trend on the cup & handle and expect we will continue to do so.

\**the Russel 1000 move could have some effect on this formation I will update any corrections that need to be made in the Daily Live Charting*

**EDIT 2:**

I can't believe I almost forgot this as we know the price range for GMEs cup & handle breakout is 525-1050 well I wanted to show everyone something on a popcorn stock that saw a similar movement recently

[AMC on the 1D](https://preview.redd.it/s66ub4y28w771.png?width=1610&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f737d151391e970167f0836211b3326e4b42700)

AMC recently had a breakout of almost the exact same pattern realizing gains of 498%.

Similar growth on GME would put it at $1035.84 per share within a couple of percentage points of our cup & handle estimate.

**Other Indicators**

**ADX**

(Average Directional Index) This is and excellent indicator of trend strength and is approaching an uptrend on the 1D as well for more [information on ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp). A movement above 33 would indicate a breakout as well.

MA50

It also looks like we are set for a nice bounce on our 50-day moving average.

TLDR; Looks like things are pointing up again as we have probably experienced enough consolidation over the last week to start to see the beginning of some price improvement.

# Part II: Russel 1000

This could definitely upset a lot of things I think overall the net effect will be positive as it appears at least some buying happened near close on Friday well into after-market, 6.07M shares of GME were traded I expect more in pre-market tomorrow. This is gonna be pretty crazy I expect that the rebalancing is not yet complete and it should lead to a interesting Monday as this all shakes out.

I am currently speculating, that GME is in fact moving into multiple indices but I am waiting to confirm. Possibly the Russel 1000 Growth Index and The Midcap Index in addition to the S&P 600. I will be re-evaluating this effect everyday in the Daily DD.

# Part III: Overall Market Conditions

I am still paying very close attention to the SPY this week as it approaches it's resistance of it's previous long term trend a rejection of this support/resistance could begin the initial steps of a correction.

\**This information's sole purpose is to inform people of the effect of the market in relation to GME and in no way advice to "play" the SPY. Many a dollar has been lost trying to predict a market crash, don't let it be your dollars.*

# Part IV: Conclusion

Technical indicators for this week are looking pretty positive moving into this week. I expect sometime in the next few days to begin a slight uptrend that will carry us into the upper part of the handle. The Russel 1000 move could continue to create volatility in the stock this week as funds that track the index jump on board so we may experience some deviation from the technical trends shown. However, ultimately they should hold true.
