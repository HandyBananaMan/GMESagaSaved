 I'm making this post to help Apes protect themselves and their families after the MOASS. Most of us are going have more money than we've ever seen in our lives. It's going to be insane.

Obligatory disclaimer: Not financial advice

Don't be stupid with your money. Seriously. When you get your tendies, let's say you make 100 million dollars, here's a few things you want to do first:

1. Get a good lawyer and accountant for your taxes

Taxes are going to be around 50% of your earnings. That's a huge chunk of money. Say what you will about taxes, but 90% of our tax money goes to corrupt bureaucrats and money laundering, while our roads remain dilapidated. Generations ago, people didn't even pay income tax, because they were already charged tax in other ways. You pay income tax, property tax, sales tax, capital gains tax, there's double taxation when you want to give your family money, all sorts of theft that they'll use to squeeze every single penny out of you. If people like Mitt Romney and Jeff Bezos can get away with only paying 10% in taxes (or not paying taxes at all), why should we pay 50%? Hire a lawyer to sort out the legal loopholes, take advantage of the opportunities at your disposal, and pay as little taxes as you can with these loopholes. Now with that extra money saved from taxes, you can use that money to actually be a real help in your community, instead of being complicit in a corrupt system and letting your tax money get wasted by the frivolous Bourgeoisie.

2. Look into hiring a PR firm to clean up your digital footprint

We are going to piss off a lot of billionaires after all is said and done. I know a lot of us treat it as a joke, but the elite are vindictive. Remember the panama papers that exposed an elitist criminal conspiracy to hoard stolen wealth in offshore accounts? Yeah, the journalist that exposed it was assassinated. You think they won't try to trace each of us after this and 'make us pay'? Even if you don't believe you did anything wrong, they can easily get the media to paint us as the bad guys and come after us. If you feel you left a big digital footprint here are the MOASS, consider hiring a firm to erase it for you, make it harder for a billionaire to quench his vendetta against us. That's especially why I don't advocate anyone posting personal pictures of themselves and their families in this sub.

3. DO NOT BRAG ABOUT YOUR WEALTH. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!!!

Don't be that douche that goes around telling people "oh man I made $50 million. Look at me haha". You will attract unwanted attention. Don't believe me? Take a look at Exhibit A:

\^ This is Jack. He won $300+ million in the PowerBall. He said it ruined his life. Want to know why?

Everyone knew about it in his town. He showed his money around, so they all came after him, demanding and expecting he solve all their problems and give them money. Every day his mailbox was flooded with requests for money. He was robbed several times. His friends sued him, strangers took him to court for even the smallest grievances hoping to get a few million out of him. It's kind of a nightmare when you think about it.

‚ÄúI pretty much lost everything I held dear in my life,‚Äù Jack Whittaker told ABC News. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the hard heart I‚Äôve got. I just don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôve become.‚Äù

Jack gave his daughter so much money she didn't know what to do with it. She bought drugs and died of an overdose. Jack's wife divorced him, and just last year, Jack was pronounced dead.

This is only one example. There's many more where these came from. Stories from lotto winners getting assassinated by family to getting their lives destroyed by gold diggers and smear campaigns to losing it all from corrupt financial advisors with malintent.

Be smart with your money, be quiet, you don't want unwanted attention. Do it for yourself and your family.

4. Don't be a slave. Ignore those that try to control you and your finances.

People will come after you, they will use all forms of psychological manipulation to get you to give them money. They will claim that you don't deserve that money, and that you must give it to them or give it away. Employers/employees that see you have money might, out of envy or greedy opportunism, apply price discrimination and raise the prices of their services only to you because you have more money. They will demand you give them more, higher tips, higher donations, pay higher prices than normal, higher expectations. They'll demand that if you don't use that money to solve their problems that you're a greedy, selfish money hungry parasite, or say something to make you feel guilty so they can subjugate you.

Remember: You are not a slave.

Your whole life you may have been a pushover, a wage slave, someone that was used and taken advantage of and never got to experience personal financial freedom.

This money is yours, it belongs to you. You are not God. You are not responsible for solving every single person's problems. You might have millions of dollars, but your resources are still finite; you can't help everyone. You decide what visions you want to pursue with your resources. You decide the select causes you are interested in helping allocate your resources towards. DO NOT LET ANYONE tell you what you can or can't do with your money. If someone tries to guilt trip you into paying their rent or buying them a car or any of that, they are not your friend. They are trying to exploit your emotions for personal gain, which is a manipulative tactic, and makes them a toxic person you want to avoid.

Again, you are in control of yourself. Take care of yourself first, then your family, friends, and finally respective communities and causes you're interested in. There's countless causes and people out there. You need to be frugal and decide which select causes you're interested in allocating/distributing your resources towards. You are not a slave to anyone, so don't let anyone make you feel forced into giving anyone money. If you feel comfortable giving a random person in the parking lot money, do it. If not, don't do it. It's that simple. You're not a bad person if you choose not to. What these people say are not what define you. You know the type of person you are by your goals and your own history.

5. Be frugal. Don't waste your generational wealth on frivolous desires.

The vast majority of lottery winners go broke within a few years (50-80%). Why do you think that is? Because they just got so much money that they don't know what to do with it. Keep most of it invested in multiple accounts after the crash. Crypto, Swiss Frank, Index funds with high dividend yields, so that you're still consistently growing your money and taking care of your family. Some people may think, "I will buy 5 mansions across the country". Have you factored in all the finances and laws that come with that (property taxes, utility bills, property laws, such as law of adverse possession that can allow squatters to steal your home in you leave it vacant for too long)? There's tons of variables you need to take into consideration before you go off on frivolous expenditures. Don't be wasteful. Sure, get a financial advisor if you want, but look into the person you're trusting to manage your assets and cash flow. Is this financial advisor trustworthy? There's been many reports of people hiring corrupt financial advisors that siphon off their wealth via embezzlement, misappropriation, or other means, and their clients never notice until it's too late. Again, be frugal, take all variables into account when considering significant expenditures, keep an accountant to manage your balance sheet, and think of your family's long-term economic future, as well as the opportunity costs related to your decisions.

Please take these 5 points into deep consideration after the MOASS. It's ultimately your choice to decide whether or not you'd like to follow these points. Again, not financial advice. I'm simply an Ape that wants to help make sure his brother and sister Apes don't get taken advantage of after the MOASS, and that they have the long-term financial stability needed to reshape their lives, and in doing so, the future around them.

Feel free to share this with an Ape you believe this post will help. See you on the moon! üöÄ
