I'm a 50-something mom to two 20-somethings. Two careers, one W-2 and one 1099. My husband has worked for the same employer for almost 30 years. Both of us came from nothing. We have worked our asses off to get where we are. No debt except our mortgage because we hardly buy anything we don't need, drive our cars for 13-15 years, cook at home 98% of the time - you get the idea.

So, a little while ago, I started learning about crypto, which led me to Andrei on youtube. As a result, I recently caught this video titled, "How 2008 Will Happen Again" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glhhCZJZZb0&list=LL&index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glhhCZJZZb0&list=LL&index=1)

Of course, I jumped over here and read this post that was the basis for the video: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0scoy/the\_bigger\_short\_how\_2008\_is\_repeating\_at\_a\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0scoy/the_bigger_short_how_2008_is_repeating_at_a_much/)

Now, I follow DaveHContrarian on twitter and he has been talking about a big melt-up this summer followed by the biggest crash we've ever seen for a while now. But I kind of took it with a grain of salt because he's just one guy and no one can know anything for sure.

But then Andrei explains it in a way that makes sense, and I came here and read that post and many of the comments. Lots of you said you were scared for your parents and called them. That's me. I'm your mom, with a dream of retiring in the very near future.

So tomorrow I'm buying some GME. I'm also going to slowly start moving balances in our 401Ks into safer pastures. Everyone says to never do that. You can't time the market. Things will come back in the long run. Blah blah blah. But if this goes as bad as I'm starting to think it will, I'm taking the safe route. There is just too damn much on the line for us.

If you want to have a conversation with your parents, maybe start with that video. The thing is, if you can get more GenXers on your side, you are golden. You know why? Because we know how to to wait.

We walked home from school by ourselves in elementary school and waited for a parent to come home. In high school, we waited in long lines to buy concert tickets. On Friday nights, we waited at the meeting spot to hear from others where the party was gonna be. We waited outside the grocery store for just the right person to approach about buying us a six-pack. We waited with our kids outside of Gamestop to buy a Wii. And we waited in ToysRUs with our kids, sitting on that cold floor, to get that special pokemon they offered up.

We definitely know how to wait.

So I will buy, hold, and wait. I will also buy vinyl now and then from Gamestop for our vintage stereo I adore that a friend gifted us, as a way to support them. I'm a big fan of Gamestop. How could I not be? My boys bought and sold games all the time. We visited that store almost as much as we visited BlockBuster (RIP, dear one). I only wish I'd gotten here sooner.

Am I an ape? I don't even know that that means, but that's okay. What I know is I'm a mom who sometimes cries herself to sleep, wishing so badly I was rich so I could help my kids and so many more because things have gotten so bad with housing costs and everything else. Every day I get more and more pissed at the 1%. Thank you for giving me one thing I can do to give some of them what they deserve.

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the awards!!! Now please drink some water, get outside if you can (not if you are in the PNW obv), and remember there is more to life than money. Love, Mom
