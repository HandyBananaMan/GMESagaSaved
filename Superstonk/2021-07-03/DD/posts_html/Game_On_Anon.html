<p>I’ll provide some quick clarity into some misunderstandings of blockchain technology to help my fellow Apes understand what to potentially anticipate from GameStop on July 14th.</p>
<p>GameStop’s page declares the following:</p>
<p>“We are building a team
We welcome exceptional engineers (solidity, react, python), designers, gamers, marketers, and community leaders. If you want to join our team, send your profile or something you've built to: nfteam@gamestop.com”</p>
<p>To analyze the talent they seek and breakdown what the path they may take we need to look into the engineering tools they seek experience and talent within. We also need to understand how programs communicate with each other and the specific standards they programs work within.</p>
<p>Solidity is a programming language used within the smart contract on E t h e r e u m. Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain, and they self-execute when conditions are met. E t h e r e u m developers (not GameStop’s developers) create different smart contract standards for others to comply within such as ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non fungible tokens). GameStop developers will need to understand Solidity enough to link their program codes to E t h e r e u m.</p>
<p>GameStop also seeks engineers will talent in React and Python. These tools/programming language will allow GameStop’s developers to build the front end dApp (think webpage) to interact with the Smart Contract code to store information within the E t h e r e u m blockchain. dApps are applications that don't exist on the blockchain but rather interact with it. dApps are used to communicate with smart contacts, and by doing that, with blockchain itself.</p>
<p>GameStop’s NFT page indicates that potential GameStop-released Non-Fungible Token (NFTs) will utilize E t h e r e u m’s ERC-721 standard. As for the targeted audience for whatever NFT offering that emerges from GameStop’s team, an animated image on the GameStop page says “Power to the players. Power to the creators. Power to the collectors.”</p>
<p>GameStop developers could build applications like CryptoKitty or items like unique accessories in video games and have that stored into the blockchain within the ERC-721 standard. These items will hold a unit of measurement in their own which makes them NFTs. They could also create an ecosystem to allows these NFT units to be forged, combined, or subdivided in their own which can make a collectible game for shareholders and we can trade with each other on GameStop’s NFT platform. </p>
<p>For simplicity think of digital collectibles that have attributes like age and rarity controlled by the parameters that GameStop’s developers create. </p>
<p>TADR: GameStop has already created an ERC-721 standard token, which is used to create NFTs. Expect NFTs to be release on July 14th when the code plumbing goes live on the smart contract.</p>
<p>If they offer NFTs as dividends or for retail to buy doesn’t matter to me. Either way we will see 🚀🚀🚀🚀🤙</p>
<p>Edit: TADR edited to use more speculative language.</p>
