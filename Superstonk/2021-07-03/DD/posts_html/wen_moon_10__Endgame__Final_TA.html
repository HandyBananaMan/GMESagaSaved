<p>Hello everyone ü¶ç, this DD will be the last one I publish untill the <strong>squeeze</strong> hence the title <strong>Endgame.</strong>  The reason is simple ; I strongly believe we are in the final stage of  the battle with the crooked hedge funds and their agents.   </p>
<p>In my humble opinion there is no reason for me to provide more  <strong>technical analysis</strong> in the near future , or perhaps evidence for a squeeze. Hundreds of DD, countless data and hours of interview with some of the most brilliant mind and expert out there should be enough to convince you that ---  </p>
<p><strong><em>The things set in motion cannot be stopped.</em></strong></p>

<p>It's been one hell of a journey from  DFV first YOLO post to the recent and exciting development with the company and every crazy event üçå that happened in between.</p>
<p><strong>I've had the time of my life sharing these DD and shitposting with you guys.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm ZEN as can be and I hope everyone else is.</strong></p>
<p><strong>at this point I think our hands are nothing but pure diamonds. üíé</strong></p>
<p>üçª</p>
<p><em>without further ado</em>, let's dive in...</p>
<h1>PART 1 - Basic charting  üåô</h1>
<p>Without using any indicators whatsover and just by looking at our daily chart things seem to be progressing well.   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/chayse1984/">u/chayse1984</a> pointed out in his DD that <strong>GME</strong> are currently about to break out of a cup and handle while being inside of a bullish pennant.   </p>
<p>For my smooth üß† out there it means we have roughly a <strong>66%</strong> chance of breaking out on the upside to a bare minimum of about <strong><em>450$.</em></strong>   </p>
<p><strong><em>(measurement from the bottom to the top of the cup on the log chart).</em></strong></p>
<p>What's also interesting to note; it would bring us exactly  where <strong>Elliot Wave guy</strong> told us the 3rd wave would bring us. üë®‚Äçüíª <strong><em>(This was also double checked by Youtuber Trading Sciences;</em></strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzT5JRMQCg">Source</a><em>)</em></p>
<p><em>When two different analysis made by numerous people point in a direction it's best to assume that these speculation have a very good chance of happening for the simple fact that it plays a key factor in the psychology of trading in individuals.</em>   </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/h1xvyqp4c2971.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=306b06d329a9869e70eba7db6bbdcfe32f3e20e7">Chart as analyzed by chayse and myself , cup and handle insine a bullish pennant supported by a trendline. </a></p>
<p><strong>SOLVING THE CUP AND HANDLE</strong>   </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/a5g0kt6bc2971.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc05fbab34daab3532572839be44ce1bccfa3ed6">The first thing we need to find out is how the cup and handle will play out.</a></p>
<p>It's pretty normal for a cup and handle to retrace as much as <strong>50%</strong> from their <strong>initial high</strong> before a blue sky breakout or in our case a trip to the <strong>moon</strong>. As illustrated below this would be the most possible scenario in my opinion, this would also trap bears causing even more buying pressure if the trend changes rapidly. </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/a4uhxj7dc2971.png?width=782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=118d66144f615d53d7f0002a2cb195c11fed5613">GME could go as low as 172$\/173$ before breaking out. </a></p>
<p>This to me is another scenario also <strong>bullish</strong> but less probable, we could see the trend reverse itself as soon as monday and we would resume our journey to the top. Such a weak downtrend would indicate that shorts and bears are now completly powerless, <em>they don't even believe in their own thesis anymore.</em>  </p>
<p>If GME remains above <strong>200$</strong> and start to break out by the end of the week, <strong>HOLY MOLY.</strong>   </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/b0c2jzaec2971.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e79b8a76e5b1c44450c41ee48c8e7ff8ee975e2">Hedgies are fucked</a></p>
<p>If you wish to understand more about Elliot Wave theory I recommend reading Elliot Wave Guy DD or watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzT5JRMQCg">video</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/g4njxx7ee2971.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfd23dfa77a134f60784811331a3208c14efa519">Elliot Wave theory applied to GME</a></p>
<p>Now we can put all the pieces of the puzzle togheter and it look something like this, two different technique ; same result. Very bullish but also realistic and works perfectly in accordance with <strong>William O'Neil trading strategy about the cup and handle theory and Elliot Wave theory.</strong>   </p>

<h1>Part 2 - In depth T.A  üåô</h1>
<p><strong>MACD</strong>   </p>
<p>Downtrend is getting weaker and weaker, bears are fucked. Just give it a little more time and this baby is gonna crossover like it always did in the  past, as you can see everytime is crosses-over we raise our floor a  little bit.   </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/4ksqdy3bg2971.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccebebe38ad71b2ed7e0455100dbd88b0e79642a">MACDADDY GETTING READY TO üåäüíßüçæ</a></p>
<p><strong>RSI</strong></p>
<p>RSI  on GME has a tendency to bounce of the median line (<strong>GREEN)</strong> and explode back up, right now we're consolidating but as you can see it's just a matter of  time until it breaks out again, we can also confirm that the current downtrend is very weak and that <strong>APES</strong> are in control.  </p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/srx2tw6tg2971.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=165a54d289092b1b6cf209425bc64582a5217807">Wow Kenny ! Is that the best you could do ? </a></p>
<p><strong>EMA</strong></p>
<p><em>The exponential moving average (</em><strong><em>EMA</em></strong><em>) is a technical chart indicator that tracks the price of an investment (like a stock or commodity) over time. The</em> <strong><em>EMA</em></strong> <em>is a type of weighted moving average (WMA) that gives more weighting or importance to recent price data.</em>  </p>
<p>The EMA on the weekly timeframe is looking <strong>great</strong>, the EMA on the daily timeframe reminds me of the way we traded back in march. Consolidating before a break out. <strong>Also BOOLISH  LFGGGGG</strong>  </p>
<h1>WEEKLY EMA</h1>

<p><strong>VOLUME</strong>  </p>
<p>Well I think everyone has noticed by now that the volume is drier than the  <strong>Sahara</strong> desert. But fear not, this is very similar to what happened back in July.   </p>
<p>Low volume pullback like this are very attractive to investors as they present low risk high rewards scenario.  </p>
<p>In simple term <strong>FOMO</strong> will be kicking in soon, and the people who didn't buy this will be mad because it's pretty much the last chance you've got at buying <strong>GME</strong> at a some <strong>''reasonable price''.</strong> <br />
I'm sure if you could bo back in time and buy at <strong>4$ / 40$</strong> you would go all in, <strong>don't miss out again.</strong> Because you might never see the low 200's ever.  </p>
<p><em>Also I'd like to point out how similar the chart is looking to the previous run up to 75$ from last summer.</em>  </p>
<p>This isn't financial advice, just common sense.  </p>

<p><strong>BOLLINGER BANDS</strong>  </p>
<p><strong><em>Bollinger bands</em></strong> <em>help determine whether prices are high or low on a relative basis. They are used in pairs, both upper and lower</em> <strong><em>bands</em></strong> <em>and in conjunction with a moving average.</em>   </p>
<p><strong>The Squeeze</strong>  </p>
<p>The squeeze is the central concept of Bollinger Bands¬Æ. When the bands  come close together, constricting the moving average, it is called a  squeeze. A squeeze signals a period of low volatility and is considered  by traders to be a potential sign of future increased volatility and  possible trading opportunities. </p>
<p>The superstonk is about to go <strong>BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR</strong> , <strong>the chart is screaming BUY ME</strong> alot of people will miss out on life changing money because <strong>''mUh DyInG BrIcK aNd MoRtaR StorE'' .</strong>   </p>

<p><strong>HVP by Bali Purr (Historical Volatility Percentile</strong>)  </p>
<p>It's my theory that <strong>DFV and many big traders</strong> used this signal as a confirmation to buy <strong>Gamestop</strong> last summer, it rarely gives a signal so when it happens it's huge.   </p>
<p><strong>it gave a signal</strong> <strong><em>last month !!!!!!!</em></strong> <strong>,</strong>  usually it takes a few weeks to breakout add a few more weeks for  volatility to reach a <strong>peak</strong>. <em>As we know volatility is key for us</em>. <strong>We broke out!!!! SO..  in a few weeks we will MOST LIKELY SEE a HUGE SPIKE in volatility A.K.A TENDIES. üçóüçóüçóüçó</strong>  </p>

<h1>PART 3 : FINAL WORD AND TLDR üåô</h1>
<p>If you are doubting Techical Analysis let me give you a quote from the book <strong><em>trading in the zone</em></strong> by <strong>Mark Douglas  :</strong>   </p>
<p><em>'' Individuals develop behavior patterns, and a group of individuals interacting with one another on a consistent basis form collective behavior patterns. These behaviors are observable and quantifiable and they repeat themselves with statistical reliability.  -- in a sense technical analysis allow you get into the mind of the market. As a method for projecting future price movement, technical analysis as turned out to be far superior to a purely fundamental approach. '</em>' </p>
<p>----</p>
<p><strong>EVERY INDICATOR IS SCREAMING BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</strong></p>
<p>Like I said in the intro I feel like everything is going as it should  right now. If you are anxious  or feeling fudy, just know that everything is gearing for a move that is gonna literally break the <strong>space</strong>-<strong>time continuum. üöÄ</strong></p>
<p>Everything is a buy right now, <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>. We're past the point (I THINK) where we'll ever get <strong>GME</strong> at a cheap price . <strong>Buy if you can HODL if you can't</strong>.</p>
<p>If  I could go back in time and tell my past self to buy more at 40$ trust I  would but I won't have the regret of not going all in at <strong>200$ , I just maxed out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>XX hodler till infinity. üöÄ</strong></p>
<p>I will see ya'll on the moon very soon. üöÄ</p>
