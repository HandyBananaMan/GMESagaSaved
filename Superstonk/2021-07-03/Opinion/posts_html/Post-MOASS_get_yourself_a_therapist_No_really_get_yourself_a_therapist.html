<p>I've been seeing posts lately about getting yourself a strong financial support team, but nothing about a strong mental health support team, we're all about to go through an INCREDIBLY shocking event, and afterwards we're gunna need help processing all of this, and learning and unlearning behaviours. So I wanted to highlight some reasons why apes should consider therapy.</p>
<p>First off, I can't stress enough how amazing having someone to talk to about anything is. You're paying these people to listen to and help with your problems, and it's wonderful.</p>
<p>Second, I can imagine a lot of you are like myself, and have trouble saying "no" to people in life. Therapists can help with this, I have gotten significantly better at saying no to people, but I still struggle with those closest to me, learning this early will save you a lot of frustration in the long run.</p>
<p>Third, you want a team if you're dealing with any mental health issues like myself. You're gunna want a psychologist to help with any diagnosing and any psychotherapy you may need or want, psychiatrists are for medication needs if you choose/need to go that route, and there's absolutely no shame in this. Then there are a plethora of different therapists out there to help with any other needs you may have, and your team of doctors can help assess all of that with you. The best part is, we no longer need to worry about what prices they may charge.</p>
<p>Fourth, the shock of getting this kind of money and what to do next with the rest of your life. No matter your age, we're all gunna walk away from this with enough money to retire happily. What to do with the rest of your life may be harder to fill than you realize. I just turned 27 a few weeks ago, I've got a lot of life left to live, I'll run out of places to visit and things to see, and I know I'm not the youngest ape here. Eventually the novelty of travel or sitting on a beach drinking from a coconut everyday will wear out. Maybe some of you this doesn't apply to and you can spend the next 40+ years living on a beach, but most of us won't be able to easily transition from a working life to a non working life. This is another great reason for therapy, to help transitioning our lives to a non working life, they'll be able to suggest ways to stay active, or ways to deal with the long periods of your day where there isn't much to do cuz you're bored with absolutely everything.</p>
<p>Fifth, you may find the money going straight to your head, and a therapist can help keep you grounded in reality and not let the money turn you into a raging doucher. </p>
<p>There are countless more reasons to go to therapy, but I think these are some solid starting points that we're all gunna need to consider. </p>
<p>Much love and peace âœŒ</p>
