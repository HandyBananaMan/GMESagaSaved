<p>I will buy a normal car, a normal house and I will get a job I enjoy doing.
Yeah, financial independece is great, but what I am most excited for is dumping my gains in green businesses, research and education. </p>
<p>I want to spend my money for the benefit of the majority, not the 1%. I hope (and know) other apes will do the same.</p>
