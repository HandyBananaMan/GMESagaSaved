Radio Shack is gone
Frys Electronics is gone
Micro Center locations are sparse

The only option for many people is to order online. I would much rather place my order through GameStop, or swing by my local store, to pick up some hobby electronics items. Call me old-fashioned, but being able to run down to the closest strip-mall to buy a replacement motor for a project, or grab some resistors for my arduino/Raspberry Pi projects. 

There is a market, and I think it fits very well with the GameStop model that leadership is establishing.
