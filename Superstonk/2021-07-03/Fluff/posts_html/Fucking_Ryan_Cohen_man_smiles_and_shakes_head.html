<p>Just a quick funny story. I was talking with my wife about how we need a new large dog crate because our current is a bit small and faulty.</p>
<p>I found one on Amazon Prime for $56. She looked on Chewy (we get our dog food there), found the same exact crate for $47.99. I said "Fucking Ryan Cohen, man!" and smiled and shook my head.</p>
<p>She then decided to turn on auto buy/ship every month for our 47lb bag of dog food (we literally buy it every month so why not).....order total for 36" crate and 47lb bag of dog food? $100.64. Guess how much a 47lb bag of the exact same dog food is on Amazon Prime? I looked it up just to see.... $65.98....LOL</p>
<p>I believe in Ryan Cohen more and more every day. Bezos, move over. Cohen has a better ring to it in every regard.</p>
<p>Don't get bored apes. Get inspired and stay hyped! Cheer for a sub 1m vol day if it gets you amped....just be excited to be part of the transformation.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
