First, in order for this to work they would have had to file with the SEC and not yet announced. Now, onto the reasoning.

What do you do on the Fourth of July in America? Get together with friends and family and chat with a little bit of alcohol in you.

Releasing an announcement on the 4th of a crypto dividend with a 14th execute day would be absolute genius because everyone in America understands the idea of taking back our independence and wealth - especially on July 4th.

It would give GameStop maximum FOMO and the people maximum chance to get in because word of mouth will never be stronger than when we are all with our loved ones.

It could be our Declaration of Independence from Wall Street, signed by Ryan Cohen and the apes. 

No longer will be stand by while you rob us blindly.  Fuck you, pay me, go to jail, do not collect your $200 on your way to re-start - because itâ€™s ours once again.

This is a once every event. We should treat it as such and do something that meets the moment, so that everyone remembers FOREVER what happened here and why.  Let it stand as a reminder for our country and the world that all people, not just the wealthy, should be treated well.
