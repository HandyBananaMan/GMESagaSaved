    "selftext": "I\u2019m hyped every day the market is open. Nothing wrong with getting excited for stuff, I love it. But it\u2019s starting to feel like people are expecting an announcement is forthcoming like it\u2019s a done deal, and I have no idea where it\u2019s coming from. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s common for a company to raise cash via selling shares then turn around and pay a dividend, seems counterintuitive. A customer service rep with a sunglasses emoji doesn\u2019t mean much, those folks aren\u2019t plugged into to any significant info. The 741 dissection is going nuts. And the July 14th NFT thing also doesn\u2019t mean an announcement needs to happen at that time either. It\u2019s all just speculation.\n\nAll this feels like a good opportunity for an enemy combatant to take some fun speculation and run a massive hype campaign to raise expectations only for them to get smashed when nothing happens. AGAIN. Remember, they are backed into a corner and their ONLY weapon is psychological warfare.\n\nNot worried about apes that have been here for months, moreso newer apes that maybe haven\u2019t been through an \u201cemotional pump and dump\u201d before. And I do see a lot of comments in these hype posts saying they don\u2019t care about dates, which is great. But it really feels like someone is taking the hype ball and overinflating it on purpose. \n\nStay vigilant, stay hyped, but stay grounded.\n\nEdit: if I could change the title, I would rephrase to say \u201cinvestor related announcements\u201d. The gamer in me is excited to see what they\u2019re cooking up. But the investor in me is not expecting to hear anything on the 14th, but I\u2019d be happily surprised if we did.",
