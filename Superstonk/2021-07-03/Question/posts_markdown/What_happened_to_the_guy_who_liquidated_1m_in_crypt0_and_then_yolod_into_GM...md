UPDATE: He has been summoned and has commented below. 

Feels like it was a few weeks ago but I have lost all sense of time tbh 😂 

I thought that was hilarious but I was also really interested in what his cost per share would look like. I imagine he’s down quite a bit atm but still holding and lurking here. Maybe he has posted a update but I don’t recall seeing it and I frequently visit this subreddit all day every day but I usually sort by new. Good chance I might have missed it. 

Not sure what to search for because all the terms are so commonly used here. Did anyone save that original post? 

If you’re the guy and you see this, have no worries fam, GameStop isn’t leaving any ape behind on the way to the top.
