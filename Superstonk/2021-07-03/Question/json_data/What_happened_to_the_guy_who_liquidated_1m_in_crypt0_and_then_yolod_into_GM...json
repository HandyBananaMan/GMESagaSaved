I imagine he\u2019s down quite a bit atm but still holding and lurking here. Maybe he has posted a update but I don\u2019t recall seeing it and I frequently visit this subreddit all day every day but I usually sort by new. Good chance I might have missed it. \n\nNot sure what to search for because all the terms are so commonly used here. Did anyone save that original post? \n\nIf you\u2019re the guy and you see this, have no worries fam, GameStop isn\u2019t leaving any ape behind on the way to the top. \n\n\n\ud83e\udd8d \u2764\ufe0f",
