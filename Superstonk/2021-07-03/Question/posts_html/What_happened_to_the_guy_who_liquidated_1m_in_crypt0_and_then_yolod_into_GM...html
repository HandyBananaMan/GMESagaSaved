<p>UPDATE: He has been summoned and has commented below. </p>
<p>Feels like it was a few weeks ago but I have lost all sense of time tbh 😂 </p>
<p>I thought that was hilarious but I was also really interested in what his cost per share would look like. I imagine he’s down quite a bit atm but still holding and lurking here. Maybe he has posted a update but I don’t recall seeing it and I frequently visit this subreddit all day every day but I usually sort by new. Good chance I might have missed it. </p>
<p>Not sure what to search for because all the terms are so commonly used here. Did anyone save that original post? </p>
<p>If you’re the guy and you see this, have no worries fam, GameStop isn’t leaving any ape behind on the way to the top. </p>
