GME with nearly $2B in cash and no debt is as safe from bankruptcy as any company in America.

Everyone I know has been adding shares. And eventually, the shorts (or their clearinghouses after they are margin called) will be buyers as well.

It's no longer necessary to watch the ticker. The price is wrong. The outcome is inevitable.
