<p>GME with nearly $2B in cash and no debt is as safe from bankruptcy as any company in America.</p>
<p>Everyone I know has been adding shares. And eventually, the shorts (or their clearinghouses after they are margin called) will be buyers as well.</p>
<p>It's no longer necessary to watch the ticker. The price is wrong. The outcome is inevitable.</p>
