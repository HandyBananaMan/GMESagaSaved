Hello everyone,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Important Edit: Turns out the Sub was just pulling a practical joke for some reason? Not sure why, but that's fine. Going to leave this post up for posterity, I won't pretend like they didn't get me with this joke. Despite this post being made in response to what we now know was a joke, the main point of this post is still relevant, please refrain from discussing other subs.**   


**Also, there is an important lesson to be learned here: If news comes out, we shouldn't be so quick to jump on it and make assumptions. Lets try and be better about that as a community**

The mods got word on this a little bit ago, the circumstances are quite odd. That having been said, [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) is not going to be the place to discuss it, we apologize. We do not know anything about the BofA lawsuit with the Subreddit or Reddit itself-- no one does.

I feel it is important to remind everyone of this rule:

Anyone talking about Wallstreetbets will get their post removed, and one warning. if you try and circumvent direct discussion by using another form of their name (ie WSB, Wallstbets, stbets, WSBets, etc.) that will be seen as a direct action in the effort of breaking this rule and we will act appropriately.

Please know that we are aware that this isn't ideal. I know that personally, I am very curious as to the ins and outs of the situation, but this rule must be enforced to comply with Reddit admins' requests for us to be more vigilant in not discussing other communities.I am sure there will be more information coming out soon, and we will let you guys know if we hear anything from Reddit about this. For now, please help us by not engaging with this topic, it will make spotting the shills much easier.

Cheers,  
B\_T
