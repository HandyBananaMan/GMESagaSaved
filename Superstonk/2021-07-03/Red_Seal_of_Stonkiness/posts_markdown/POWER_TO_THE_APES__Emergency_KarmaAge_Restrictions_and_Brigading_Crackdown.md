Let me first say that I love this community along with all of the mods and we are working diligently to prevent any serious action against the sub. We have received warnings about brigading and we take these VERY SERIOUSLY, so as a result we are hoping to enforce our [NO BRIGADING rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o80eky/no_brigading/) as well as minimize the amount of posts we need to moderate to make sure this can be enforced.

Due to a very popular reddit subreddit going private due to apparent legal issues (Edit: It appears it is back online for the time being, but that is besides the point), we are increasing our timeline to enforce these policies. Please understand this is NOT an attack on the community but rather a dire attempt to protect it. I am hoping all of you can work with us on this and not make the situation worse. Thank you.

# Increased Karma / Age Restrictions - Effectively Immediately

I have reached to reddit admins to explain that we are on this and taking it very seriously, and I have initiated a vote with the mods to increase the karma restrictions. Therefore, effectively immediately, the restrictions are now as follows:

&#x200B;

||Karma (old)|Karma (NEW)|Age (old)|Age (NEW)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Posts|2000 karma|8000 karma|120 days|240 days|
|Comments|500 karma|2000 karma|60 days|120 days|

\*Please note that Award Karma does NOT count toward this, and that Approved Users will bypass these restrictions. Also, please note that other automod rules still apply to Approved Users.

Please note that these are emergency restrictions and once we know more about the situation, we will relax these restrictions so that all apes can comment. However, we NEED to be able to successfully moderate the sub and this increase will help us do that effectively. Thank you all for understanding.

# NO BRIGADING

Brigading is discussing other subs in a negative light or in a way that they will not appreciate. As a result, we have already implemented a [NO BRIGADING rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o80eky/no_brigading/) and will be enforcing it diligently. We urge all of you to report posts that violate this rule:

>Under NO circumstances, will brigading be tolerated on this subreddit or any other. Individuals who are discovered to be participating in this, risk being permanently banned for this reason.  
>  
>Brigading includes: - organized voting on other subs - harassing other subs - using [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk) to defame other subs - posting screenshots from other subs  
>  
>Additionally, Reddit Admins have placed an irremovable code into our automod that prevents linking other subs entirely.

Additionally, we have updated automod to include several key phrases and terms that are often use to represent other subs. Please avoid using these terms. We WILL be removing those under the NO BRIGADING rule and doing so more intensely if you try to circumvent the automod. Do not do it. Just stay focused on GameStop and use other mediums to discuss this content.

I am okay if you want to discuss the suit against reddit if specific subs are omitted. Thank you for understanding and helping to make this subreddit the best on reddit.

![Stay focused.](https://preview.redd.it/4jbk6bshg1971.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=8baa1b097ab0163681c5197a17f51f6c14ca494c)

# GameStop: To the Moon!

Let's all remember why we are ultimately here. It is not to push r/Superstonk to the top of the lists, but rather to have a safe and secure space to discuss our most favorite stock, GameStop (GME), and to build a community that rivals nations. Let's encourage each other to stay focused, and not get distracted by anything else. There is no reason to deviate from this discussion.

I would like to remind you that our rules are designated to focus on GameStop stock, and not to focus on demeaning or engaging with other subreddits. You can discuss whatever you want in private chats, in Discord, and on Twitter. I ask that you please confine off-topic discussions to those avenues.

# Let's all remember that reddit has its policies and rules and we should be following them regardless of our personal takes. Please confine off-topic discussions to other social media and private chats. Thank you!

EDIT: While certain subreddits are now back to Public view, we are going to leave these restrictions in effect, at least for the weekend. I think we have a flood coming, of new users and discussion, and therefore think of this as "the levies" being raised. Approved Users will see no difference, and if you truly want to be added, you can contact a moderator who can fast-track this process, if you have solid post history. Thank you all for understanding. We are simply doing what we think is best for the subreddit, and know that all of this will be relaxed when things settle down.

EDIT 2: I just noticed the table up top showed 3000 karma for commenting, but it's really 2000 karma. This is a typo because we changed it last minute to something more reasonable. You can see this has been reflected in the rules and wiki. Sorry for the confusion.
