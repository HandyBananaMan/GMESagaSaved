    "selftext": "Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes around the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nWhat a day to HODL GME with Diamantenh\u00e4nde! Yesterday had modest gains in the German market, but the US market had a great run-up on relatively low volume! We all know that the MOASS hasn't started, but it's certainly refreshing to see green again. Red or Green, Apes are prepared to buy and HODL until the short positions are closed. As the RRP continues to creep closer to $1T again; with massive dumps of gold over the weekend; with the Yellen forum-sliding and FUD attacks increasing - it certainly feels like momentum is picking up again. The MOASS is inevitable as long as Apes HODL. Let's show them our determination. Our resolve. Our *Diamantenh\u00e4nde*.\n\nToday is Tuesday, August 10th, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 120 minutes in: **$164.47 / 139,82 \u20ac**  *(volume: 1448)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 115 minutes in: $164.03 / 139,45 \u20ac  *(volume: 1394)*\r\n- \u2b1c 110 minutes in: $164.06 / 139,47 \u20ac  *(volume: 1375)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 105 minutes in: $164.06 / 139,47 \u20ac  *(volume: 1313)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 100 minutes in: $163.90 / 139,34 \u20ac  *(volume: 1271)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 95 minutes in: $163.91 / 139,35 \u20ac  *(volume: 1268)*\r\n- \u2b1c 90 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 1265)*\r\n- \u2b1c 85 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 1205)*\r\n- \u2b1c 80 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 1191)*\r\n- \u2b1c 75 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 1173)*\r\n- \u2b1c 70 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 1128)*\r\n- \u2b1c 65 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 744)*\r\n- \u2b1c 60 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 727)*\r\n- \u2b1c 55 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 714)*\r\n- \u2b1c 50 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 597)*\r\n- \u2b1c 45 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 589)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 40 minutes in: $162.91 / 138,50 \u20ac  *(volume: 504)*\r\n- \u2b1c 35 minutes in: $162.18 / 137,88 \u20ac  *(volume: 391)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 30 minutes in: $162.18 / 137,88 \u20ac  *(volume: 339)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 25 minutes in: $162.03 / 137,75 \u20ac  *(volume: 323)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 20 minutes in: $161.68 / 137,45 \u20ac  *(volume: 249)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 15 minutes in: $161.65 / 137,43 \u20ac  *(volume: 137)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 10 minutes in: $161.68 / 137,45 \u20ac  *(volume: 132)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 5 minutes in: $161.69 / 137,46 \u20ac  *(volume: 113)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $161.71 / 137,48 \u20ac  *(volume: 58)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 US close price: $161.13 / 136,98 \u20ac   *($161.89 / 137,63 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD.
