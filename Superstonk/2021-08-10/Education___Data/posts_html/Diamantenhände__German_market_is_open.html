<p>Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes around the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>What a day to HODL GME with Diamantenhände! Yesterday had modest gains in the German market, but the US market had a great run-up on relatively low volume! We all know that the MOASS hasn't started, but it's certainly refreshing to see green again. Red or Green, Apes are prepared to buy and HODL until the short positions are closed. As the RRP continues to creep closer to $1T again; with massive dumps of gold over the weekend; with the Yellen forum-sliding and FUD attacks increasing - it certainly feels like momentum is picking up again. The MOASS is inevitable as long as Apes HODL. Let's show them our determination. Our resolve. Our <em>Diamantenhände</em>.</p>
<p>Today is Tuesday, August 10th, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>
