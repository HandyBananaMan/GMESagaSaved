<p>TL;DR: The goal of the post is to spread FUD by lowering the price expectations from $10m to $100k and to make you worry that this will take months to unravel so better sell at $100k than not. Please beware.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1: The post has now been removed and locked by MODS. THANKS!</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3: Thanks for pointing out that I need to wrap this post in a credible amount of “BUY &amp; HODLE” and rockets, so here we go: 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 buy and hodl 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀</strong></p>
<p>I read https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n28mhx/the_180_wall_explained/ this morning and I’m amazed as to how many just jumps right in and accept the post as truth.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts and why I think it’s definitely worth AT LEAST being cautious about the post:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s NOT DD - even though many responds to it as “god tier DD”, it’s not. It’s just someones opinion. It’s not backed by with the amount and quality of proof, that real DD needs to have and is mainly speculation. <strong>It was posted as DD flair, but our MOD team changed it because it’s NOT DD.</strong></li>
<li>It’s main take-away is the anchoring of a $100.000 CEILING and a prolonged period of time with 2 squeezes, clearly making some people think about the $10m floor and if it’s just too much. <strong>MOD /u/heyitspixel has already stepped in with a pinned reply that he does not believe the plot about 2 squeezes</strong>. Mod team quote: <em>“To everyone unsure about one or two squeezes taking place, you should read the comments. A lot of folks explained, why it’s nearly impossible to squeeze twice. I agree with them.”</em></li>
<li>It introduces a new FUD about - more or less - that the power is not in OUR hands but rather we’re just a mere pawn in the chess play where we will just have to wait for the DTC/SEC to judge whatever is going to happen. “Not being up to apes” is a dangerous thought and WILL create paperhands.</li>
<li>It’s from an “unknown” poster that has not produced any DD before and out of the blue, the lightning strikes and he has THE answer to “everything”. The poster has almost no history here and as MOD’s already replied in a pinned reply to the post, it has already been posted once a couple of days ago. Now the poster does it again even when arguing he’s almost to sick to stay awake?</li>
<li>It plays on the “oh I’m [the poster] so sick, but I’m doing this for you guys [martyrism]” to build empathy for the guy so it’s harder to ask the “uncomfortable” questions, pointing out that it’s FUD. </li>
<li>It has more uploads and awards in a short time than I would expect to happen organically (ie. I think it’s “backed” by shills/bots)</li>
<li>It completely turns the gameplay upside down by arguing that it’s actually not the shorts, that are keeping the price from hitting 180 but the longs. The centiment in the post is that the shorts would like an even higher price and more volatility - basically a 180 degree reversal of the common belief in here after 3 months of VERY much digging and DD writing/reading. If this was actually the case, it would be VERY easy for the shorts to raise the price as they could just hammer the marked with buy-orders by starting to cover, EASILY outweighing the longs. </li>
</ol>
<p>To me, there’s just too much “fishy-ness” going on in this post and I’m a bit concerned that 100s of you just jump right in because it’s confirmation bias that turns off your critical thinking.</p>
<p>TRUST NO ONE !</p>
