Please beware.\n\n**EDIT 1: The post has now been removed and locked by MODS. THANKS!**\n\n~~**EDIT 2: The post has now been made visible again by MODS**~~ (AND it\u2019s gone again now)\n\n**EDIT 3: Thanks for pointing out that I need to wrap this post in a credible amount of \u201cBUY & HODLE\u201d and rockets, so here we go: \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 buy and hodl \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80**\n\nI read https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n28mhx/the_180_wall_explained/ this morning and I\u2019m amazed as to how many just jumps right in and accept the post as truth.\n\nHere are my thoughts and why I think it\u2019s definitely worth AT LEAST being cautious about the post:\n\n1.\tIt\u2019s NOT DD - even though many responds to it as \u201cgod tier DD\u201d, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just someones opinion. It\u2019s not backed by with the amount and quality of proof, that real DD needs to have and is mainly speculation. **It was posted as DD flair, but our MOD team changed it because it\u2019s NOT DD.**\n2.\tIt\u2019s main take-away is the anchoring of a $100.000 CEILING and a prolonged period of time with 2 squeezes, clearly making some people think about the $10m floor and if it\u2019s just too much. **MOD /u/heyitspixel has already stepped in with a pinned reply that he does not believe the plot about 2 squeezes**. Mod team quote: *\u201cTo everyone unsure about one or two squeezes taking place, you should read the comments. A lot of folks explained, why it\u2019s nearly impossible to squeeze twice. I agree with them.\u201d*\n3.\tIt introduces a new FUD about - more or less - that the power is not in OUR hands but rather we\u2019re just a mere pawn in the chess play where we will just have to wait for the DTC/SEC to judge whatever is going to happen. \u201cNot being up to apes\u201d is a dangerous thought and WILL create paperhands.\n4.\tIt\u2019s from an \u201cunknown\u201d poster that has not produced any DD before and out of the blue, the lightning strikes and he has THE answer to \u201ceverything\u201d. The poster has almost no history here and as MOD\u2019s already replied in a pinned reply to the post, it has already been posted once a couple of days ago. Now the poster does it again even when arguing he\u2019s almost to sick to stay awake?\n4.\tIt plays on the \u201coh I\u2019m [the poster] so sick, but I\u2019m doing this for you guys [martyrism]\u201d to build empathy for the guy so it\u2019s harder to ask the \u201cuncomfortable\u201d questions, pointing out that it\u2019s FUD. \n4.\tIt has more uploads and awards in a short time than I would expect to happen organically (ie. I think it\u2019s \u201cbacked\u201d by shills/bots)\n5.\tIt completely turns the gameplay upside down by arguing that it\u2019s actually not the shorts, that are keeping the price from hitting 180 but the longs. The centiment in the post is that the shorts would like an even higher price and more volatility - basically a 180 degree reversal of the common belief in here after 3 months of VERY much digging and DD writing/reading. If this was actually the case, it would be VERY easy for the shorts to raise the price as they could just hammer the marked with buy-orders by starting to cover, EASILY outweighing the longs. \n\nTo me, there\u2019s just too much \u201cfishy-ness\u201d going on in this post and I\u2019m a bit concerned that 100s of you just jump right in because it\u2019s confirmation bias that turns off your critical thinking.\n\nTRUST NO ONE !",
