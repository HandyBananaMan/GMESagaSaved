I thought it was sus, that out of a sudden horse racing gets promoted in this sub. So I decided to wrinkle myself, and I found an article (2 years old) that says citadel security is the third largest owner of Churchill down stock. The company with the horse races.\n\nI think my work is done here, perhaps someone with a Bloomberg terminal or more wrinkles can dig deeper into this.\n\nApes together strong, stay safe and enjoy your weekend! \ud83e\udda7\u2764\ufe0f",
