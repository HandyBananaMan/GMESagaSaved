<p>As we apes learned: Question everything and don‚Äôt trust anyone. I thought it was sus, that out of a sudden horse racing gets promoted in this sub. So I decided to wrinkle myself, and I found an article (2 years old) that says citadel security is the third largest owner of Churchill down stock. The company with the horse races.</p>
<p>I think my work is done here, perhaps someone with a Bloomberg terminal or more wrinkles can dig deeper into this.</p>
<p>Apes together strong, stay safe and enjoy your weekend! ü¶ß‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
