    "selftext": "[Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea) actually *halted short selling* during the pandemic.  They implemented the  \n [World\u2019s Longest Short-Selling Ban](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-26/world-s-longest-short-selling-ban-coming-to-an-end-in-korea).   \n\nThey are bringing the ban to an end now, but with [much tougher laws in place](http://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210406000820) including prison time, $100% fines of the order amount and up to 500% fines of unfair profits made due to naked short selling.  \n\nThey are allowing short selling to resume on May 3rd.  [The Korean Capital Markets Act](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_service/lawView.do?hseq=43324&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lang=ENG) has been revised to specifically come down hard on naked short sellers.  \n\nUnited States regulators are watching this sub right now.  They are looking for the information that we are handing them on a silver platter.  We are making their job easier by doing the research and coming up with ideas.  This intense regulator attention to this sub will lesson over time.  Now is the time to shine a bright light on issues, provide evidence, and suggest solutions.  Another thing that can be done is to shine a light on all of the other countries that are doing a fantastic job regulating short sellers and show the US regulators these shining examples.  The time is now and each and every one of you apes, ants, and other creatures of the jungle can find valid information through a google search.  \n\nGood ideas, articles, DD, and quality memes get upvoted to the point of gathering worldwide attention.   \n\nI suggest more apes take interest in DD of how other countries are successfully battling short sellers and bring more of those stories into the light for everyone to see and to consider.  \n\nDr. T said that apes are making a difference because regulators are passing rules on issues that we have brought to the attention of our community.  Lets keep that rolling.\n\nKorea halted short selling altogether during the pandemic.  What do you think short sellers did to the United States markets during the pandemic?  What do you think the markets would currently look like if short selling had been banned this whole time?  \n\nDo we need to suggest some regulations to US regulators to help protect businesses in the future against crises?  Short sellers pounded on American businesses at their weakest moments during the harshest economic climate of our lifetime.  Countless businesses got pounded into  oblivion and not a single one of them needed short sellers making things harder on them during these desperate times when they are just trying to survive and hang on to their business and employees.  How many jobs were lost to short sellers?  And for what?  So billionaire companies could add to their bottom line?\n\nKorea did it right.  They protected the businesses from the short sellers.  America threw the businesses to the wolves when the businesses were at their weakest and most vulnerable point.  \n\nNaked short selling is absolutely predatory and needs to be abruptly stopped.  Penalties and fines need to be absolutely harsh and prison time needs to be a consequence.  \n\nHow did Korea suffer by banning short selling altogether through this time?  Now that's an interesting question.\n\nAmerican businesses and American jobs are being absolutely and mercilessly destroyed just so billion dollar hedge funds can fatten their already bloated pockets.  It isn't right.  And it needs to stop.  Dr. T has been fighting this battle for DECADES and has only *now* really gained a substantial audience.   (Thank you Dr. T for your efforts.)\n\nEvery single Ape, Ant, and jungle creature out there can fan this flame for positive change.  You do it with your upvotes, your DD, your comments, and your posts.  You do it by sharing your opinions, sharing articles, and sharing youtube videos.  You do it by coming up with your own original content on and sharing it on any social media.  You do it by making truthful memes, finding and trimming powerful statements made by influential people and sharing those videos.  You do it by buying your shares and holding.  By voting in the proxy vote.  \n\nYou do it by helping to educate the newbies and answering their questions.  You do it by contacting Congress and making your opinion known.  \n\nYou talk about it. You raise awareness.  You post about it.  You share information with other influencers out there to spread the word about the DD and desire for positive systemic change.  \n\nYou all have been doing this and it's absolutely beautiful to behold.  This movement is gaining momentum and more eyes are upon us than ever.  But more than that, eyes are on all of the social outlets out there and news of systemic change is spreading globally.  \n\nI'm not saying we caused Korea to crack down on short sellers, I'm saying that we heard of the news of Koreans cracking down on short sellers.  I'm saying that the global awareness of these injustices is increasing across the globe and we are a part of that growth.  \n\nI'm saying that every upvote matters.  Every single shareholder from 0.X to X^X matters.  Every single Ape matters and every single Ant matters.  Every non-shareholder supporting positive change in any way matters.\n\nYou are not powerless.  Systemic change is happening.  If zero individuals engaged in this movement, nothing would have happened except that more and more businesses would have been shorted into oblivion.  \n\nSo keep up your energy.  Support systemic change in any helpful way that you can.  \n\nRight now I'm participating by writing this post and upvoting other posts that I feel have merit.\n\nI'm also talking with friends about how to open a brokerage account and giving them suggestions on how to teach their kids about financial literacy and pointing them in the direction of how to get their kids interested in finance and compound interest.  Talk with kids and friends about how retirement accounts work and how easy it is to set one up.  \n\nSystemic change is on the institutional side, but in my opinion it is also on the individual side by increasing the financial knowledge and awareness of those around you.  \n\nBe a good ape and support the apes around you.  Support the ants, the sombreros, and anyone trying to make a positive difference in the world.  They feel your support.  \n\nNow go eat your crayons, and don't forget to share.  \n.  \n\n>!\ud83d\udd8d\ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udd8d\ud83d\udd8d\ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udd8d\ud83d\udd8d\ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\udd8d\ud83d\udd8d!<\n\n.  \n\n>!\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf2e\ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf0f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udc4d!<",
