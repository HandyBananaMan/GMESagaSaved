Hey beautiful apes,  this is just starting here!   We are a bunch of countries and millions and millions and millions of possible apes in the making. 

Trends here are powerful as shit.   Just look at what one new reggaeton song does.  You get all the busty latinas dancing like it’s an ape mating ritual.  

GME is more than a trend.  It’s a well documented, DD intensive, mathematical movement!   

If GME doesn’t give you a hard on like watching a Latina doing “perreo” to a Bad Bunny song, i don’t know what else will. 

When we moon 🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑 (very soon) I will throw a dancehall perreo party and stream all the sexy latinas dancing to the beat of GME.   

The second party I will invite all the APEs to a private Island in Panama’s Pearl Islands Archipelagos in the pacific coast and go crazy!!   (Im well known for throwing sick parties with the hotests girlss around!!). 

Remember, HOLD and VOTE!   The floor ir $10milliom!!  GME to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
