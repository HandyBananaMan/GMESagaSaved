<p>Prior to GME, I was a novice investor that picked a few stocks based on the relevance to up and coming trends and selected run of the mill index or target funds.  I did alright, nothing special and I felt like I had an ok understanding on how things operated.  I was fairly content to continue on this route for the foreseeable future and hope that after 20-30 more years I will have enough to retire.  </p>
<p>In the last 3 months my eyes have been opened.  I don't think I will ever be able to fall back into line with the rest of the world being brainwashed.   I have enough shares that after MOASS I could just, convert to gold, bury in my yard and dig it up when I need it, never needing to invest it again.   Believe me its tempting to do just that.  </p>
<p>I am like to find a balance, with heavy diversification in many different things, like real estate, crypto, international stocks, possibly some VC action, and lots and lots of charity work.</p>
