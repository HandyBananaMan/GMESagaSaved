<p>Hey beautiful apes,  this is just starting here!   We are a bunch of countries and millions and millions and millions of possible apes in the making. </p>
<p>Trends here are powerful as shit.   Just look at what one new reggaeton song does.  You get all the busty latinas dancing like it’s an ape mating ritual.  </p>
<p>GME is more than a trend.  It’s a well documented, DD intensive, mathematical movement!   </p>
<p>If GME doesn’t give you a hard on like watching a Latina doing “perreo” to a Bad Bunny song, i don’t know what else will. </p>
<p>When we moon 🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑 (very soon) I will throw a dancehall perreo party and stream all the sexy latinas dancing to the beat of GME.   </p>
<p>The second party I will invite all the APEs to a private Island in Panama’s Pearl Islands Archipelagos in the pacific coast and go crazy!!   (Im well known for throwing sick parties with the hotests girlss around!!). </p>
<p>Remember, HOLD and VOTE!   The floor ir $10milliom!!  GME to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
