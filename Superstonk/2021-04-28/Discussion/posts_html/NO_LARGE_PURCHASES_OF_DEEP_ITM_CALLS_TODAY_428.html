<p>u/Dan_Bren DEEP ITM calls you know what it is.</p>

<p>Since there's no new news on the DEEP ITM call front (which is always good news). I wanted to take this time to give a shoutout to my fellow ape <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YoungbloodAA/">u/YoungbloodAA</a> for the kickass background. My setup wasn't truly complete until now.</p>
