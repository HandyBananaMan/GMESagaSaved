We are a bunch of countries and millions and millions and millions of possible apes in the making. \n\nTrends here are powerful as shit.   Just look at what one new reggaeton song does.  You get all the busty latinas dancing like it\u2019s an ape mating ritual.  \n\nGME is more than a trend.  It\u2019s a well documented, DD intensive, mathematical movement!   \n\nIf GME doesn\u2019t give you a hard on like watching a Latina doing \u201cperreo\u201d to a Bad Bunny song, i don\u2019t know what else will. \n\nWhen we moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11 (very soon) I will throw a dancehall perreo party and stream all the sexy latinas dancing to the beat of GME.   \n\nThe second party I will invite all the APEs to a private Island in Panama\u2019s Pearl Islands Archipelagos in the pacific coast and go crazy!!
