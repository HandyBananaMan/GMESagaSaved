<p>For those who are confused about how margin calls work and what to expect during the MOASS.</p>
<p>Day 1) 
   HF (A) The EOD close price is noted and margin requirements are calculated. (Example $400 close)</p>
<p>Day 2) 
   HF (A)
      The hedge fund now has to start closing failing short positions and will need to consider selling long positions (if they have any) to cover the cost of buying back shares at a rapidly increasing price. ( Example $1200 close)</p>
<p>Day 3)
   HF (A), HF (B) and HF (C)
   Are now in a pickle and are all being margin called repeating day 2.</p>
<p>This will go on and on until all hedge funds have been called or have voluntarily closed their shorts. When a margin call occurs, they each have up to 5 days to meet their own requirements from the initial call (and they will use as much of it as they can as they want to avoid a parabolic move up on day one).</p>
<p>Its unclear how many hedge funds are short on GME but there are a lot, keeping quiet not to scare their own investors. So the MOASS could take weeks if not a  month or two to untangle, a good example is tesla (that had 20% SI if I remember correctly and was constantly squeezed for a year due to new shorters coming in and getting squoze. </p>
<p>Speculation: We could see a good first run and stall followed by 10-20% daily gains (may not seem like a lot but compounded daily, it really is.) There will be dips by new shorters but we know our DD and will hold. </p>
