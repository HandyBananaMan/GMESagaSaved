<p>He owns part of New York bank of Mellon . They own shares. Ipso-facto, the best investor in the history of the market believes in GME. To those of you looking for confirmation bias, please toss a coin to your Witcher. </p>

<p>Logically, anyone who spends their lives meticulously looking for truth in companies would be appalled at hfs trashing companies. The media campaigns. The shill tactics. I’m sure some hfs have taken shots at brk over the years. Gme was clearly a strong turnaround play.</p>

<p>Edit2 Bank of America is/was also hodling. </p>
<p>Edit 3 explained what this means more thoroughly below with post(linked in comments)</p>
