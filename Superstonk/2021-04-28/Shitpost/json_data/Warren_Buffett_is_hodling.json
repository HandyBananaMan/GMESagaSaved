To those of you looking for confirmation bias, please toss a coin to your Witcher. \n\nSay it with me. \u201cBullish\u201d.\n\nLogically, anyone who spends their lives meticulously looking for truth in companies would be appalled at hfs trashing companies. The media campaigns. The shill tactics. I\u2019m sure some hfs have taken shots at brk over the years. Gme was clearly a strong turnaround play.\n\nEdit#1 I wrote in-so-facto because I\u2019m a moron but people have Latin fetishes so I changed it.\n\nEdit2 Bank of America is/was also hodling. \n\nEdit 3 explained what this means more thoroughly below with post(linked in comments)\n\nPlease see other friendly post 28/04/2021 - GME Bloomberg Terminal information on slide 3+ for ownership stats. \n\nAlso, be aware it seems like this is up to date. The company can actually sell whenever. We will only be able to look at the holdings again at the quarter end. Sorry for any confusion, I was more excited that those companies were holding at the same time as DFV. It also gives us something to check on during the new filings. \n\nNot financial advice.",
