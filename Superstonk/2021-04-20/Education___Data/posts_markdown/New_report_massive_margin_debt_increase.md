Seems like our dear investors have some debt.

[From Investopia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin_debt.asp) **Margin debt** is the amount of money an investor borrows from the broker via a **margin** account. **Margin debt** can be money borrowed to buy securities or sell short a stock.

It looks scary as hell. But is it? I'm just a stupid ape with half a wrinkle, though.

Some apes with more wrinkles can tell us what this means?
