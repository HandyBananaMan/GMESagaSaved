<h1>DFV FUD</h1>
<p>Ok let's start with the obvious one in the room, I've seen loads of people/new accounts say DFV sold.</p>
<p>No he didn't, why? he is a value investor, he sees deeper fucking value in a company, and it would be stupid to put this much in and pull out BEFORE the transformation of the company is over.</p>
<p>So the argument of him having pulled out is nonsensical.</p>
<p>He will at one day though because doing a stock market is to make money, but don't expect any value investor to stop halfway through.</p>

<h1>Twitcher offered a 1000 to lie, lied yo</h1>
<p>People were quick to jump on this but the dude who said he was offered a 1000 bucks to post bad shit about GME was lying, again be sceptical even if it feeds into your bias.</p>
<p>the post got removed, as the person himself confirmed later that it was fake.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/g69yaf7klau61.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02221009c8b259515a07195b05ed338aa95a76e6</p>
<p>So at this point you might think "ok Rennie, it's missing it's OOMPH today", and you're right I've been focussing on something else, yesterday I got pulled aside by some friends and how r/superstonk is looking right now and I had to take a good hard look at the sub and the mentality we hold.</p>
<p>And I personally didn't like some of the stuff I've seen, people who are trying to help are getting called shill because they come with lower numbers, people who want to help and immediately getting kicked to the side as shill, this is not what I want guys.</p>
<p>Again we need to keep our head straight and look at every possible scenario.</p>
<p><strong>None of this is financial advice, but I do feel people should examine their risk/rewards.</strong></p>
<p>I know many of us will jerk react to what I am about to say and think it is FUD, but I feel it is something we need to explore as the MOASS is impending. There are several things that you need to know when it comes to extremely high market volatility. Selling isn't as easy as pressing "sell at market" and expecting the number you "sold at" to appear in your brokerage account. When trading in extremely volatile conditions, like the upcoming squeeze, it's important to know exactly HOW to exit your position and not fall victim to these traps.</p>
<p><strong>I know that the DD on this sub is good but in trading nothing is a 100% guaranteed</strong></p>
<p>This is not meant as FUD in any way, but rather to get everyone to think about their own positions and what they want to do, and how they want to do it. also if possible to get people talking and have different conversations so people make an educated estimation/decision of what they want and how they want it.</p>
<p><strong>This is a personal choice for everyone, so listen to your own logic, reasoning and research.</strong></p>
<p>I've seen a lot of people talk of 100 million is a "sure thing", I'm sorry I know you all like this but I want everybody to be grounded for this.</p>
<p>The statistical probability this will even reach 1 million is an anomaly, I'm not saying it won't happen I'm saying in my personal opinion I don't expect to reach that level. Yes I know the memes of 1 million and everything, but let's be honest there is a high likelihood that before that happens the government would step in, the nasdaq would stop trading or something else can happen.</p>
<p>We do not know how far it will go.</p>
<p>And just as much the <a href="https://gmefloor.com/">gmefloor.com</a> thing, please realise it's a meme.</p>
<p>The thing is with a short squeeze it is impossible to know how high it can, or will go to or how long it will last, I've seen people post it would be minutes, I've seen others post that it will be days. One thing I do have to say is that I rethought my own exit strategy, it used to be "catching the falling knife" but it has changed as I think it would be closer to catching a falling piano.</p>
<p>so this leads me to my other point.</p>
<p>Everyone here should evaluate <strong>their own</strong> Risk vs reward situation.</p>
<p>And at the same time I'd ask you to be realistic, no one knows what will happen and anyone telling you that ANY price is a 100% is wrong. We can have all the specific indications for a Moass/squeeze but we don't know what will happen.</p>
<p>So in order for people to make a well educated decisions on their own stock they should ask themselves some questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>how much money do I want to make with this stock</li>
<li>how high can it go?</li>
<li>how much can I afford to lose? (for example if the stock goes back down at some point)</li>
</ol>
<p>\^ these are important questions that people need to ask themselves and act on them.</p>
<p>An exit strategy for me is covering my initial cost of investing at a "lower hanging fruit" number, when it squeezes, as it's more likely I'll cover that point, from that point on I can let it ride to higher numbers and be sure I'm playing with the house's money. (this means lowering exposure and still have a possibility of reward).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Everyone should think on his own how he or she wants to exit.</strong></p>
<p>There is no perfect plan, unless you're DFV and you're the time traveler.</p>
<p>But let's look at a few different versions of exit strategies.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/nqyzxkxamau61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d25af6b3270d19faee5f0df3b85b26a310c92223</p>
<p><strong>"The Tiered exit"</strong></p>
<p>One I've heard a lot about is a "tiered exit" a tiered exit is putting everything in tiersfor example:</p>
<p>15@ 10</p>
<p>10 @ 15</p>
<p>20@ 20</p>
<p>etc etc, this depends fully on how you want to place this and what you think is a logical step, this could be at 5000, a 10000 or any number whatsoever. <strong>(remember I'm giving examples, I'm not setting numbers for you to follow).</strong></p>
<p>Another exit strategy is</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/utw7mkazlau61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26c4adbe667c2dc006505bd33b2b48b9d1bf91c</p>
<p><strong>"The value investor"</strong></p>
<p>This is what DFV did, he saw an opportunity with a company and invested on a number he thought the company would be low, but he will ride this to a certain set point for him and either cash out then, or do so in layers like in the tiered exit.</p>
<p>This means he said to himself X number is low, I want to have Y number for returns etc etc, this is also called the long play.</p>
<p>or how he got his name, seeking deeper value in things and seeing them before others do.</p>
<p>But even DFV has a number set in his head where he want's to take profit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/m43dw07umau61.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203f6be178ae92085ab49f0637408639f185276f</p>
<p>Another would be</p>
<p>"<strong>the mixer"</strong></p>
<p>The mixer is a simple concept of my own tbh, just take a bit from the <strong>Tiered exit,</strong> a bit off the <strong>Value Investor</strong>.</p>
<p>You can choose to get some of your initial investment out at a certain point, have another part you want to leave with that company, and a part you'll sell at a higher point.</p>
<p>Or any mix you'd like, remember this is fully up to you and up to your own risk assessment.</p>

<p>There are loads of exit strategies out there, but be sure to research what is best for <strong>YOU!</strong> (seriously google is a thing people, use it, do your own DD and your own legwork).</p>
<p>Again I don't question the DD at all, I do however think people here need to take a good hard look at their risk/reward system and at reasonable numbers, I personally don't think 10m is something that can happen, again I could be a 100% wrong and if it does hell I'll be just as excited as everyone else, I just think the chance of happening is low to none.</p>
<p>What I am saying is what I've said before, you should not risk more than you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/cdkr5x32nau61.png?width=462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd02d4b9b9033840c294dd16a73f3ee0bec89cf0</p>
<p>Now something else I want to touch on.</p>
<p>You have to realise that yeah sure it's all fun and games checking out all those buildings and what's going on in them, but what if we have one idiot in here that's mentally unstable?what if they think it's ok to go there and he hurts someone or worse?</p>
<p>Seriously everyone have a sense of decorum.</p>
<p>Do not under any circumstances pester the personal that works there, as these are still people who just have a job, you may not agree with what they have done but that's what the courts are for.</p>
<p>we need to stay on our best behavior always, because we are better than they are. I want everyone to be logical and decent here, and everyone here does his or her own part in that.</p>
<p>So I'm asking you please, PLEASE guys chill, we are in what people can say is a "high stress" situation, and tempers can run high.</p>
<p>Don't call people SHILL because you don't agree with them, I've said before go into conversation with them and you may be able to learn why they think a certain way.If it's logic then you can learn, if it's a troll you'll notice soon enough.But don't kneejerk react that everyone who disagrees is wrong.</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>
