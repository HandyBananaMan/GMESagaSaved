<p><strong>TLDR: The ETF IJR has 2,700,000 shares of GME available to borrow at 0.3% and is an iShares ETF owned by Blackrock (BLK). BLK has a total of 14 ETFs that contain GME totaling 6,698,453 shares and rebalance quarterly, so these shares will most likely be held through the MOASS. If BLK has been lending shares like this for weeks they hold the MOASS trigger making the SEC rule changes critical to clearing liftoff. Opinion: As Blackrock is a passive investment firm and the 4th branch of the government they won't sell anything during the MOASS prioritizing Citadel's demise to buy their assets on the cheap and stabilize the economy from their mountain of fuckery.</strong></p>
<p>This isn't a new theory, but I still see people who seem to be wondering about the low borrow rate. Hopefully I can provide some food for thought/confirmation bias/something to be refuted so collective learning can continue as I'm smooth brained as the next. There may be some karma farming here as well because I rarely post and don't want to be kicked out of this sub in case of MOASS rule changes to combat shills.</p>
<p>Poking around the Stonk-O-Tracker (<a href="https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/about.php">https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/about.php</a>) I see the ETF data on the About page. I don't have access to <a href="https://etfdb.com">etfdb.com</a> where this data came from, so if we're going with my confirmation bias the assumption is that this info is accurate, specifically the borrow rate. There are a few odd entries...some ETFs with 0 available shares and one with 2.7M coupled with a 0.3% rate – IJR.</p>

<p>That short hedge fund honey pot is an iShares ETF owned by Blackrock. All ETFs containing GME are listed here: <a href="https://www.etf.com/stock/GME">https://www.etf.com/stock/GME</a>. The total number of GME shares tied up in ETFs is 9.5M making less float available during the MOASS. There are 14 in the iShares ETF collection totaling 6,698,453 shares. The share count came from the iShares info on each ITF from that list: <a href="https://www.ishares.com/">https://www.ishares.com/</a></p>

<p>I have been wondering about the low borrow rate that has stayed fairly consistent while number of shares available fluctuates as does the GME price (watching iborrowdesk numbers). There has been some conjecture of supply/demand driving the borrow rate, but that didn't quite click for me. Investopedia says supply/demand is part of the equation, but collateral has a lot to do with the rate which adds another variable to it. It doesn't seem to be a reliable way to determine market sentiment or direction of price particularly when a stock is manipulated as much as GME. These 'smartest guy in the room' investor types aren't lending shares without being fairly certain the decision will make them money or making decisions without considering how they play out well into the future.</p>
<p>Two theories seem to make sense to me–as I enjoy a nice bottle of Chianti and a bowl of french onion crayon soup by the fire, throwing my art college degree in to feed the flames. These include the market maker lending at wildly advantageous rates (major fuckery) or some whale setting a trap lending because they know where the stock is going, and *spoiler alert* it's not crashing.</p>
<p>Cue Susquehanna and Citadel squeezing Blackrock for $500B on TSLA over the course of the last year, Palafox setting a bomb in the treasury market, the DTCC board power struggle, Griffin and HF cronies scooping up real estate via derivative collateral and buying some the most expensive properties around the world setting a bomb in that market, Blackrock having more cash on hand than they've had in a long while just in case of a market-wide fire sale, BLK being a passive management firm and going long to fund Cohen since the beginning of Chewy and now the turnaround of Gamestop–what else? How many reasons do you need to wipe out Citadel?</p>
<p>The rate on iborrowdesk has been low since I started checking in March. Seeing that Blackrock is currently offering 2.7M shares at 0.3% makes my confirmation bias lean toward those ETFs with 0 shares having been drained already (conjecture). It seems like the best position to be in during an event like a GME squeeze/catalyst to a market crash would be to have set it up and have the trigger in hand–be first, be smarter.</p>

<p>I think Blackrock won't be selling any of their loose \~2M shares during the squeeze as their goal is long term wealth and market stability i.e. removing Citadel. The latter is far more important than some short term gains to the fourth branch of the government who already holds massive cash reserves and trillions in assets. As soon as the last couple SEC rules are a go and they're sheltered from liability, it's in their best interest to make sure this squeeze is indeed the MOASS as there are multiple hedge funds to clear out as well as Citadel Securities holding hundreds of billions.</p>

<p>EDIT 1 (as I assume there'll be more...due to smooth brain, crayons, art college, you know the drill). My confirmation bias jumped on the wikipedia definition of Blackrock as a an 'index fund and passive management firm'. As /u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SneakingForAFriend/">SneakingForAFriend</a> pointed out they they have more active strategies as well. They are also a 'multinational investment management corporation' according to wikipedia again. Skepticism is welcomed and important.</p>
