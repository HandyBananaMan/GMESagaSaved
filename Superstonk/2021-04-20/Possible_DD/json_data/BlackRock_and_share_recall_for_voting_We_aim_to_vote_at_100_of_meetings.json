With regards to non-U.S. holdings, generally we estimate that we vote successfully at approximately 90% of meetings. Of the remaining, 8% are not voted due to shareblocking and 2% are not voted due to either the fund\u2019s leverage, impediments such as ballots received post cut-off date or post meeting date, or other restrictions like in-person attendance or power of attorney being required in order to vote. \n\n  \n\n[https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/fact-sheet/blk-responsible-investment-faq-global.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/fact-sheet/blk-responsible-investment-faq-global.pdf)",
