I feel like a true Redditor now. I can feel the love.\n\nPlease, if you\u2019re wanting to give paid awards to this post, instead buy some more (fractional) GME or donate to your favourite charity.\n\n**Edit 2:** So, some bot just messaged me to say I\u2019ve made it to the front page of Reddit. Not sure how to take this news. Slightly overwhelmed and feeling the love fellow apes.\n\nI\u2019m thankful to have made a connection with so many of you with my post. It just shows how many of us \u201czen apes\u201d are genuinely out there.",
