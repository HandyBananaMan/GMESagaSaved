There’s only one directive no matter what, and that’s to carry on hodling. 

That’s not to say that the bias confirmation helps, and it’s very educational and entertaining along the way; but being content and comfortable just patiently waiting is the norm and standard response to anything other than the MOASS.


**Edit 1:** I never thought I’d actually have to edit a post to thank kind internet strangers for their awards, and say “well this blew up” and “RIP inbox”. I feel like a true Redditor now. I can feel the love.

Please, if you’re wanting to give paid awards to this post, instead buy some more (fractional) GME or donate to your favourite charity.

**Edit 2:** So, some bot just messaged me to say I’ve made it to the front page of Reddit. Not sure how to take this news. Slightly overwhelmed and feeling the love fellow apes.

I’m thankful to have made a connection with so many of you with my post. It just shows how many of us “zen apes” are genuinely out there.
