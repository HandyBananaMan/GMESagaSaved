**Geometric Mean** \- A number, which we can use to estimate the price per share as people jump off at different points on the way up, which is expected, everyone has a different price point, just as different sell points are expressed.

Some people are going to sell on the way up (not a lot) and most are going to sell on the way down, only a few will sell on the peak price.

So to visualize how much it would cost, based on a conservative short interest of 150% it would force Hedgies to cover 75 Million shares. The numbers indicate the peak price.

10k per share price total payout would be $106,050,000,000 @ 1414 per share

42k per share price total payout would be $217,350,000,000 @ 2898 per share

69k per share price total payout would be $278,550,000,000 @ 3714 per share

100k per share price total payout would be $335,400,000,000 @ 4472 per share

1m per share price total payout would be $1,060,650,000,000 @ 14142 per share

2m per share price total payout would be $1,500,000,000,000 @ 20000 per share

20m per share price total payout would be $4,743,375,000,000 **@ 63245 per share**

So don't settle for rookie numbers. We can absolutely aim for the stars here, since this is a ONCE in a millenium opportunity. We would by no mean bleed the world dry, it will just be a redistribution of wealth. And remember; this is based on a SI of 150%. It is most likely way higher.

TLDR: Fasten your seatbelts, because when the squeeze starts, we are going to fucking Alpha Centauri.🚀
