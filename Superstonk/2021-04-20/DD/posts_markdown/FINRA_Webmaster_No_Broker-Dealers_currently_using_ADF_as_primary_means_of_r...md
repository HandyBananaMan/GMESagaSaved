**Is this our 4/20 Smoking Gun?**

And where are the **19,285,389 missing bananas** from the 4/13 - 4/20?

&#x200B;

I emailed **FINRA Webmaster** today and said

"I wanted to know more about your FINRA ADF data, but it appears as though ADF trading volume is not reported on either:

[https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily)

or

[http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-April.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-April.html)

It seems strange that ADF data is not reported for any securities.¬† I see some of the data listed on a Bloomberg terminal, but with so much volume routed through ADF, it seems like customers and investors and regulators should be able to access that data.

Please let me know how else I might be able to access the daily ADF data. Thanks,"

&#x200B;

He replied:

**"Hello, there are no broker-dealers currently using ADF as their primary means of reporting trades.¬†Therefore, no trading volume would be expected since no one is currently using that facility to report trades. Thank you."**

&#x200B;

[That really is strange...](https://preview.redd.it/9d6nxvaq0fu61.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5367355a9b6b50bda2a1b3692f3afe28d2c8f7a)

This seems to completely contradict the already questionable Bloomberg Terminal Data

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu9a2d/190421\_gme\_bloomberg\_terminal\_information/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu9a2d/190421_gme_bloomberg_terminal_information/)

which is missing **>30%** of the total trading volume every day for the past week

The Bloomberg Terminal also shows **4-5x** **more volume** is going through the **FINRA ADF** than the next highest exchange every single day for the past week (**and likely much longer**).

You tell me?
