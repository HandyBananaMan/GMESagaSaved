Salutations once again my fellow apes. u/possibly6 back with some juicy confirmation bias solely using technical analysis.  


As always, this aint no mothafuckin financial advice, hoe. The views expressed here are solely my approach to investing in this specific equity. I ape an am.

Let's get right down to business. I have reason to believe the price action we are seeing is nearly identical to January right before we ran ago 500+.

If you've been following me for a while, this is how I was able to predict the drop from 348.5 to sub 200 the day before it happened, as we well as time the majority of the run in March.

I also read a great theory written by u/HomeDepotHank69 which sparked my interest to dig deeper on the subject. You can read his posts here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/muoepo/gme\_magnum\_opus\_theory\_round\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/muoepo/gme_magnum_opus_theory_round_3/)

I commented this: 

"Technical ape here. I did a theory very similar to this one right before the march run comparing it to the jan run. I think you're spot on, and I don't think today's price really matters. The broad market is taking a hit today.

If you're right, tomorrow should replicate price action on 1/13. However, you could also compare it to that of 2/22 - 2/24. On 2/23 we had roughly half the volume of 2/22 and price hit a lower low than the LOD on 2/22. 2/24 price hit from 40 to a high of 200 after hours.

I think what's important for this theory to remain in tact is the low volume today and a close lower than yesterday's. How much lower we close is irrelevant."

&#x200B;

The working theory is that today would have very low volume and a decline in price, and sure enough that's what we saw today. Let's take a closer look and compare the two timeframes to each other.

And here's today's chart:

The scale is a bit rough on the eyes, though you can visualize the similarities. Today we had 4.6m volume, roughly half of yesterday's 10.5m volume. 

Worth nothing that the broad market took a hit today, not too surprised to see GME go down with it, though it is very likely the broad market is down bc GME is getting shorted through the entirety of the market lol.

Jan 11 we had 14.9m volume, and Jan 12 we had 7m volume. roughly half the volume of the previous day. **HMMM**

Tomorrow should mark Friday's T+2 - all executed options should settle by 4/21 and start showing movement.  HODL ðŸ“·ðŸ“·  

All options that were executed on Friday should start to reflect tomorrow as it's had two days to settle.  

&#x200B;

Worth noting: Jan 15, monthly options expire, 4 trading days later, price runs from 40 to 513

Feb 19, monthly options expire. 3  trading days later, price runs from 40 to 200 after hours.   

If this theory proves to be accurate, expect some nice upward price action tomorrow. Whatever the case may be, I will hodl.

In Elliot Wave speak, I have wave 3 of 5 set to finish around 220, though to be completely honest I dont even really watch price action anymore. It doesn't matter. I hodl no matter what.

I know you're all jacked about the RC tweet, so am I. Bears either shaking or their getting fucked up. or both. 

TLDR: Short post, read it you ape. If you daytrade GME your mom's a hoe. Can we stop with all the rensole drama and get back to posting solid DD? Please? Prepare for the best expect the worst.

4/22 is 4/20 too ðŸ¤”
