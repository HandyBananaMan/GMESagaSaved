**TL;DR**

**The Squeeze Is Happening Now**


Let's see see, today is a really big day for the Snake Banks, selling themselves like your mom on the street corner. It's okay though, there's a list of johns she uses.

Get it, she keeps getting fucked by the same people over and over again. 

Just like you.

OH SHIT ARE THEY SELLING TWITTER STOCK

also

> The Notes are our debt securities, the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities, including our structured notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because structured notes result in increased operational, funding and liability management costs to us, we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity.

Boy you guys are just literally everywhere huh? I started out by researching each individual one, but as I learn their names and subsidiaries, they just show up, for free, like your mom.

**What are they selling?**

Secured bonds, not always guaranteed, but ones that will make a lot of equity for them. We talk about them needing equity and liquidity, but do they?

Or does snakey hedgies just want a buffer between their personal banana numbers and apes? 

I'm moving on from these drafted up Sales proposals, but I know who's going to buy them. Another snake bank. If you'd like to hunt yourself, filter for forms FWP and 424B2.

Guggenheim Capital is being the 'institutional investment manager' for Security Investors LLC, they made sure to file on...today. I didn't know Guggenheim had it's tail dipped in so many pies. [Today.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000791185/000182126821000123/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

Always great to see a familiar face.

I'm going to put a pin in this filing, cause Citadel isn't the most uncommon name but.

[Citadel Investment Advisory, Inc. PO BOX 900 CHESTERLAND, OH  44026](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811907/000181190721000005/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

**Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet** 

 > The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (the "FHLBank") obtains most of its funds from the sale of debt securities, known as consolidated obligations, in the capital markets. Consolidated obligations, which consist of bonds and discount notes, are by regulation the joint and several obligations of the eleven Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the "Finance Agency"), successor to the Federal Housing Finance Board effective on July 30, 2008 (collectively, the "Regulator"), and the regulations issued by the Regulator authorize the Finance Agency to require any Federal Home Loan Bank to repay all or a portion of the principal of or interest on consolidated obligations for which another Federal Home Loan Bank is the primary obligor. Consolidated obligations are sold to the public through the Office of Finance using authorized securities dealers. Consolidated obligations are backed only by the financial resources of the eleven Federal Home Loan Banks and are not guaranteed by the United States government.

Oh hey! On April 12, 2021,  JP Morgan is filing a beneficial ownership of ::checks hand:: [PLBY Group](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000019617/000001961721000288/PLBY_GROUP_INC.htm) nearly 3 million of their stocks under Sole Voting Power, and checkmarked

 > x A parent holding company or control person in accordance with § 240.13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(G);

Hey, we remember what that is, right? JP Morgan is soooo generous, helping out other companies. BTW, Sole Voting Power means JP Morgan gets to decide what to do with those nearly 3 mill stocks, it's not a Shared Voting power which means the company gets, any say really.

Also, PEG U.S. Direct Corporate Finance Institutional Investors IV LLC is the beneficial owner of 7.4%.

Let's keep an eye on that name.

[Monthly Distribution](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001600824/000185362021000002/cgcmt2014gc19_10d_42021.htm) of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC19 just got filed, that's pretty normal. Let's check out the Holders/Sponsors of this fund.

Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp.
Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company
MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC
Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P.
The Bancorp Bank
Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC
RAIT Funding, LLC

Aaaand

U.S. Bank National Association (principal executive offices of issuing entity) 

Issuing Entity, real fancy.

Okay, next thing. Aww hey it's a stock offering by [Full Circle Brewery](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001715599/000166516021000493/xslC_X01/primary_doc.xml), reason for the Amendment is they need to extend their campaign? Let's check this out. Arthur Moye is trying to get someone to invest in him, he even has a website. 

Look at those sweet little numbers, he's offering Class C non voting stocks, the target is 1964 and the deadline is July 19, 2021. He has 22 employees.

Poor guy, guess he doesn't know the right people.

I wonder if this is how hedgies find people needing help? You know they wouldn't accept no class c stocks with non voting power tho. Some lawyers are 'ambulance chasers', maybe some hedgies are 'I own your company now fuck you'.

Sorry, that got away from me.

[Wookey Technology](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001854155/000185415521000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml) is also offering stock, or a minimum of 5 thousand accepted by any outside investor. He's got 38 investors, bless them. 

Investing is interesting, isn't it?

Here's another important thing to remember this is included in pretty much all of these contracts, in big bold letters deep inside the language.

**Hedging Risks**
 
Very, very, VERY few times have I seen under that caption that a company states they don't do that sort of thing. 

Let me tell you, if you heard the RBC bank's salty ass answer to the analyst from BoFA, [you'd deffo laugh](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001000275/000121465915001685/s225150425.htm). She told him.

*Janice Fukakusa - Royal Bank of Canada - Chief Administrative Officer, CFO*
Oh, I'm sorry. You were talking about the CAD41 million in earnings. That's strictly foreign currency translation on earnings.

*Steve Theriault - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst*
So there's no hedging offset to that number?

*Janice Fukakusa - Royal Bank of Canada - Chief Administrative Officer, CFO*
 No.

*Steve Theriault - BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst*
 So that won't necessarily rise next quarter? There's no sort of smoothing on that?

*Janice Fukakusa - Royal Bank of Canada - Chief Administrative Officer, CFO and Bad-Ass Bitch*
 Right, because we do not hedge our future earnings. So that's strictly translation, as we earn it and translate it to Canadian dollars. We only hedge our equity.

Fucking dead. 

anyway i haven't even participated yet in this beautiful holiday, ill go fix that in a minute.

Uh right, so stuff. You know that meme where spongebob is angrily showing beneath his bed and the closet and the whole trash heap outside?

*Where are they going to get the money to pay a floor of a million plus?*

Yeah, that. So I'm just going to keep meandering through this shit and giving a feel for what kind of money moves around daily, what kind of funds they've got on their end. 

Until the names become ingrained in your head.

Until the numbers become as familiar and heartwarming and *within reach* to ape's mind as it is to snakes.

You see, because the squeeze is getting squozed right now, and it has been for decades. On you.

Take a walk somewhere or a drive, look around. Look at the schools, fuck look at the average person's bank account.

Ape reading this, most of them anyway, know exactly the pressure I mean.

It's time to squeeze back.

Happy 4/20
