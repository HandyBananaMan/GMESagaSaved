It's okay though, there's a list of johns she uses.\n\nGet it, she keeps getting fucked by the same people over and over again. \n\nJust like you.\n\n*\n\nSo below this is companies that are selling Notes, Senior Notes, their funds. Apparently the top links don't work, I'm fixing it, but [this one](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/dateRange=custom&category=custom&startdt=2021-04-16&enddt=2021-04-20&forms=FWP) goes to the list of companies offering sales.\n\n[HSBC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000083246/000110465921052270/tm2113400d2_fwp.htm)\n\n> If we were to repurchase your Notes immediately after the Original Issue Date, the price you receive may be higher than the Estimated Initial Value of the Notes.\n\nNice language, I wonder what it means?\n\n\n[Bank of America](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000070858/000119312521119914/d141072dfwp.htm) \n3.5 Billion\n\n[Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001666268/000095010321005698/dp149553_fwp-ps1365msfl.htm)\n\nUBS is being their dealers for a sales commission, great guys those. Real salt of the earth.\n\n[Bank of Montreal](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000927971/000121465921004342/d419211fwp.htm)\n\nTheir\u00a0subsidiary(holding), BMO Capital Markets Corp. (\u201cBMOCM\u201d), is the agent for this offering.\n\n[Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001666268/000183988221005998/msf1361_fwp-03859.htm)\n\nRepublic of Columbia\n[1 Billion](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000917142/000119312521121876/d117835dfwp.htm)\n\nBank of New York Mellon\n[400 Million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001390777/000119312521122039/d127542dfwp.htm)\n\n[Royal Bank of Canada](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001000275/000114036121013422/brhc10023364_fwp.htm)\n\nOH SHIT ARE THEY SELLING TWITTER STOCK\n\nalso\n\n> The Notes are our debt securities, the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities, including our structured notes, the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition, because structured notes result in increased operational, funding and liability management costs to us, we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity.\n\nBank of America\n[4.5 Billion](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000070858/000119312521119919/d141072dfwp.htm)\n\n\n[JP Morgan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001665650/000182912621002705/jpm_fwp.htm)\n\n[AMC fund 19](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001857646/000185764621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)\n\nThose are single offerings, btw, they have more.\n\n[The link](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/dateRange=custom&category=custom&startdt=2021-04-16&enddt=2021-04-20&forms=FWP) has preliminary proespectus regarding the Notes they are going to be putting up for sale. Lots of really familiar faces liiiike\n\n* JP Morgan\n* Citibank, \n* Royal Bank of Canada,\n* Bank of Nova Scotia\n* Bank of America\n* HSBC\n* Bank of New York Mellon\n* Republic of Colombia\n* Bank of Montreal\n\nA tidy little list, and by no means is it complete.\n\nAnd here's Ally Financial Inc offering up 1 BILLION dollars. I've never heard of them, let's check out their \n\n  * Joint Managers\n* Barclays Capital Inc.\n* Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\n* J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\n* RBC Capital Markets, LLC\n* BofA Securities, Inc.\n* Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.\n* Goldman Sachs\u00a0& Co. LLC\n* Morgan Stanley\u00a0& Co. LLC\n* U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc.\n\n\nOh dear, those are familiar names. They're co-managers of a LOT of funds guys. \n\nProbably cause they're never sure who's fucking their wife that day\n\n[Genesis Energy Finance Corp](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001022321/000119312521121461/d150074dfwp.htm) is offering about 250 million in Notes, let's check out these\n\n  * Joint Managers\n* BofA Securities, Inc.\n* BNP Paribas Securities Corp\n* Capital One Securities, Inc.\n* Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\n* Fifth Third Securities, Inc.\n* RBC Capital Markets, LLC\n* Regions Securities LLC\n* Scotia Capital (USA) Inc.\n* SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc.\n* Wells Fargo Securities, LLC\n* Co-manager:\u00a0\u00a0Comerica Securities, Inc.\n\nBoy you guys are just literally everywhere huh? I started out by researching each individual one, but as I learn their names and subsidiaries, they just show up, for free, like your mom.\n\n**What are they selling?**\n\nSecured bonds, not always guaranteed, but ones that will make a lot of equity for them. We talk about them needing equity and liquidity, but do they?\n\nOr does snakey hedgies just want a buffer between their personal banana numbers and apes? \n\nI'm moving on from these drafted up Sales proposals, but I know who's going to buy them. Another snake bank. If you'd like to hunt yourself, filter for forms FWP and 424B2. \n\n * \n\nGuggenheim Capital is being the 'institutional investment manager' for Security Investors LLC, they made sure to file on...today. I didn't know Guggenheim had it's tail dipped in so many pies. [Today.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000791185/000182126821000123/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)\n\nAlways great to see a familiar face.\n\nI'm going to put a pin in this filing, cause Citadel isn't the most uncommon name but.\n\n[Citadel Investment Advisory, Inc. PO BOX 900 CHESTERLAND,\u00a0OH\u00a0\u00a044026](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811907/000181190721000005/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)\n\n * \n\n[Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001330399/000156459021019552/na-8k_20210414.htm) isn't selling stuff, but I like their language regarding debt secuties.\n\n**Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet** \n\n > The Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (the \"FHLBank\") obtains most of its funds from the sale of debt securities, known as consolidated obligations, in the capital markets. Consolidated obligations, which consist of bonds and discount notes, are by regulation the joint and several obligations of the eleven Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the \"Finance Agency\"), successor to the Federal Housing Finance Board effective on July 30, 2008 (collectively, the \"Regulator\"), and the regulations issued by the Regulator authorize the Finance Agency to require any Federal Home Loan Bank to repay all or a portion of the principal of or interest on consolidated obligations for which another Federal Home Loan Bank is the primary obligor. Consolidated obligations are sold to the public through the Office of Finance using authorized securities dealers. Consolidated obligations are backed only by the financial resources of the eleven Federal Home Loan Banks and are not guaranteed by the United States government.\n\n * \n\nOh hey! On April 12, 2021,  JP Morgan is filing a beneficial ownership of ::checks hand:: [PLBY Group](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000019617/000001961721000288/PLBY_GROUP_INC.htm) nearly 3 million of their stocks under Sole Voting Power, and checkmarked\n\n > x A parent holding company or control person in accordance with \u00a7 240.13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(G);\n\nHey, we remember what that is, right? JP Morgan is soooo generous, helping out other companies. BTW, Sole Voting Power means JP Morgan gets to decide what to do with those nearly 3 mill stocks, it's not a Shared Voting power which means the company gets, any say really.\n\nAlso, PEG U.S. Direct Corporate Finance Institutional Investors IV LLC is the beneficial owner of 7.4%.\n\nLet's keep an eye on that name.\n\n[Monthly Distribution](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001600824/000185362021000002/cgcmt2014gc19_10d_42021.htm) of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC19 just got filed, that's pretty normal. Let's check out the Holders/Sponsors of this fund.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Realty Corp.\nGoldman Sachs Mortgage Company\nMC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC\nCantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P.\nThe Bancorp Bank\nRialto Mortgage Finance, LLC\nRAIT Funding, LLC\n\nAaaand\n\nU.S. Bank National Association (principal executive offices of issuing entity) \n\nIssuing Entity, real fancy.\n\nOkay, next thing. Aww hey it's a stock offering by [Full Circle Brewery](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001715599/000166516021000493/xslC_X01/primary_doc.xml), reason for the Amendment is they need to extend their campaign? Let's check this out. Arthur Moye is trying to get someone to invest in him, he even has a website. \n\nLook at those sweet little numbers, he's offering Class C non voting stocks, the target is 1964 and the deadline is July 19, 2021. He has 22 employees.\n\nPoor guy, guess he doesn't know the right people.\n\nI wonder if this is how hedgies find people needing help? You know they wouldn't accept no class c stocks with non voting power tho. Some lawyers are 'ambulance chasers', maybe some hedgies are 'I own your company now fuck you'.\n\nSorry, that got away from me.\n\n[Wookey Technology](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001854155/000185415521000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml) is also offering stock, or a minimum of 5 thousand accepted by any outside investor. He's got 38 investors, bless them. \n\nInvesting is interesting, isn't it?\n\nHere's another important thing to remember this is included in pretty much all of these contracts, in big bold letters deep inside the language.\n\n**Hedging Risks**\n \nVery, very, VERY few times have I seen under that caption that a company states they don't do that sort of thing. \n\nLet me tell you, if you heard the RBC bank's salty ass answer to the analyst from BoFA, [you'd deffo laugh](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001000275/000121465915001685/s225150425.htm). She told him.\n\n*Janice Fukakusa\u00a0- Royal Bank of Canada - Chief Administrative Officer, CFO*\nOh, I'm sorry. You were talking about the CAD41 million in earnings. That's strictly foreign currency translation on earnings.\n\n*Steve Theriault\u00a0- BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst*\nSo there's no hedging offset to that number?\n\n*Janice Fukakusa\u00a0- Royal Bank of Canada - Chief Administrative Officer, CFO*\n\u00a0No.\n\n*Steve Theriault\u00a0- BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst*\n\u00a0So that won't necessarily rise next quarter? There's no sort of smoothing on that?\n\n*Janice Fukakusa\u00a0- Royal Bank of Canada - Chief Administrative Officer, CFO and Bad-Ass Bitch*\n\u00a0Right, because we do not hedge our future earnings. So that's strictly translation, as we earn it and translate it to Canadian dollars. We only hedge our equity.\n\nFucking dead. \n\nanyway i haven't even participated yet in this beautiful holiday, ill go fix that in a minute.\n\nUh right, so stuff. You know that meme where spongebob is angrily showing beneath his bed and the closet and the whole trash heap outside?\n\n*Where are they going to get the money to pay a floor of a million plus?*\n\nYeah, that. So I'm just going to keep meandering through this shit and giving a feel for what kind of money moves around daily, what kind of funds they've got on their end. \n\nUntil the names become ingrained in your head.\n\nUntil the numbers become as familiar and heartwarming and *within reach* to ape's mind as it is to snakes.\n\nYou see, because the squeeze is getting squozed right now, and it has been for decades. On you.\n\nTake a walk somewhere or a drive, look around. Look at the schools, fuck look at the average person's bank account.\n\nApe reading this, most of them anyway, know exactly the pressure I mean.\n\nIt's time to squeeze back.\n\nHappy 4/20\n\n****\n\n***\n\n**\n\n*\nThe Banks Are Selling Government Bonds to the Hedgies- The Floor is 250 Million [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtp8y1/the_banks_are_selling_government_bonds_to_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtt8wg/master_feeder_funds_privately_negotiated_loans/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (unformatted)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mubk7t/the_worlds_largest_shell_game_the_floor_is_250/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[The Banks ARE The Hedge Funds - The Floor is 250 Million Link-Free Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/muoyq8/the_banks_are_the_hedge_funds_the_floor_is_250/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nEdit 1: sorry about the links guys fixing it\n\nEdit 2: trying to make it look...neater\n\nBonus Banana Numbers\n\n**Two banks merging**\n\n>[Webster and Sterling](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000801337/000114036121013384/nt10023268x5_425.htm\n) are uniting to create a powerhouse bank with over $63 billion in assets.\n\n>Together, we will have $52 billion in deposits, $42 billion in total loans (80% of which are commercial), and 225 banking centers across the footprint.\n\n> The combined company will be called Webster Financial Corporation (NYSE: WBS) and the combined bank will be called Webster Bank.
