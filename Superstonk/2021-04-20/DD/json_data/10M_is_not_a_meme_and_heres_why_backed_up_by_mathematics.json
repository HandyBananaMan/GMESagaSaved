    "selftext": "**Geometric Mean** \\- A number, which we can use to estimate the price per share as people jump off at different points on the way up, which is expected, everyone has a different price point, just as different sell points are expressed.\n\nSome people are going to sell on the way up (not a lot) and most are going to sell on the way down, only a few will sell on the peak price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Floor is 10 mil](https://preview.redd.it/wnbuhxfmbcu61.png?width=1459&format=png&auto=webp&s=df934f9f67362b372f1fcd556d5a97914ee99733)\n\nSo to visualize how much it would cost, based on a conservative short interest of 150% it would force Hedgies to cover 75 Million shares. The numbers indicate the peak price.\n\n10k per share price total payout would be $106,050,000,000 @ 1414 per share\n\n42k per share price total payout would be $217,350,000,000 @ 2898 per share\n\n69k per share price total payout would be $278,550,000,000 @ 3714 per share\n\n100k per share price total payout would be $335,400,000,000 @ 4472 per share\n\n1m per share price total payout would be $1,060,650,000,000 @ 14142 per share\n\n2m per share price total payout would be $1,500,000,000,000 @ 20000 per share\n\n20m per share price total payout would be $4,743,375,000,000 **@ 63245 per share**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo don't settle for rookie numbers. We can absolutely aim for the stars here, since this is a ONCE in a millenium opportunity. We would by no mean bleed the world dry, it will just be a redistribution of wealth. And remember; this is based on a SI of 150%. It is most likely way higher.\n\nTLDR: Fasten your seatbelts, because when the squeeze starts, we are going to fucking Alpha Centauri.\ud83d\ude80\n\nFor better explanation of the geometric mean, read this:  [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/what-is-geometric-mean/#:\\~:text=What%20is%20Geometric%20Mean%3F,investment%20or%20an%20investment%20portfolio](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/what-is-geometric-mean/#:~:text=What%20is%20Geometric%20Mean%3F,investment%20or%20an%20investment%20portfolio)\n\nEDIT: Credit goes to [u/Raught19](https://www.reddit.com/user/Raught19/) !
