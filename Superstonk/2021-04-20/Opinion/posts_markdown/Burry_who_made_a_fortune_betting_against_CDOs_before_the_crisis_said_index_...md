I had a bit of extra time to connect a few dots. Last year, I followed this Bloomberg post about Michael Burry's position against ETFs, specifically the Russell 2000. It was interesting to me because I personally know shorters who got crushed by the R2000s rally after the GFC.  Today, it is quite apparent that the sell-off is on. When you consider all of the DD from the last 72 hours, it is obviously a liquidation event to prepare for a major correction. 

TL;DR Is the R2000 forming a Head & Shoulder pattern? Is this the reversal?

[ A head and shoulders pattern is a chart formation that appears as a baseline with three peaks, the outside two are close in height and the middle is highest. In technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern describes a specific chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. ](https://preview.redd.it/9z8fwr2n6du61.png?width=1077&format=png&auto=webp&s=af5fb25483c1e4611290545958d52b8567aa1de9)

  
The head and shoulders pattern is one of the most common reversal formations. **It is important to remember that it occurs after an uptrend and usually marks a major trend reversal when complete.**
