Headline says it all. 
I rest my case.
See you on the moon🙌💎

TLDR: 10mil is statistically unlikely. True. But so is a beta of -30. 
10 Mil is the floor.
Always has been.
Always will be.

Edit: Thanks for all those awards kind apes. 
As a user mentioned this squeeze depends on how diamond handed 🙌💎 ALL apes are.

As more apes manifest the 10.000.000 Floor the more of a self fulfilling prophecy this becomes.
The power of manifestion is real.
Happy 4/20 to everyone 🍁
Obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥
