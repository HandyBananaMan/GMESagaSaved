    "selftext": "I had a bit of extra time to connect a few dots. Last year, I followed this Bloomberg post about Michael Burry's position against ETFs, specifically the Russell 2000. It was interesting to me because I personally know shorters who got crushed by the R2000s rally after the GFC.  Today, it is quite apparent that the sell-off is on. When you consider all of the DD from the last 72 hours, it is obviously a liquidation event to prepare for a major correction. \n\nTL;DR Is the R2000 forming a Head & Shoulder pattern? Is this the reversal? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/17qkpejc6du61.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3949310284f601b70f0c5fe276811bc9122529c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q97psgcy6du61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=31bc563dd72de261c08c3ce6f42899aa334dcf48\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ A head and shoulders pattern is a chart formation that appears as a baseline with three peaks, the outside two are close in height and the middle is highest. In technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern describes a specific chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. ](https://preview.redd.it/9z8fwr2n6du61.png?width=1077&format=png&auto=webp&s=af5fb25483c1e4611290545958d52b8567aa1de9)\n\n  \nThe head and shoulders pattern is one of the most common reversal formations. **It is important to remember that it occurs after an uptrend and usually marks a major trend reversal when complete.**  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2 Hour Chart ](https://preview.redd.it/wm5paxlp6du61.jpg?width=1847&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1962dcfe87cdd028f66e388e37eeba5f3a2c0f8)\n\nI like the stock!",
