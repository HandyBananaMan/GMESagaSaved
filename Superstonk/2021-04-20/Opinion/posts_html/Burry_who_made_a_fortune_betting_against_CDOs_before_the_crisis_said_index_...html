<p>I had a bit of extra time to connect a few dots. Last year, I followed this Bloomberg post about Michael Burry's position against ETFs, specifically the Russell 2000. It was interesting to me because I personally know shorters who got crushed by the R2000s rally after the GFC.  Today, it is quite apparent that the sell-off is on. When you consider all of the DD from the last 72 hours, it is obviously a liquidation event to prepare for a major correction. </p>
<p>TL;DR Is the R2000 forming a Head &amp; Shoulder pattern? Is this the reversal? </p>

In technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern describes a specific chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. </a></p>
<p>The head and shoulders pattern is one of the most common reversal formations. <strong>It is important to remember that it occurs after an uptrend and usually marks a major trend reversal when complete.</strong>  </p>
