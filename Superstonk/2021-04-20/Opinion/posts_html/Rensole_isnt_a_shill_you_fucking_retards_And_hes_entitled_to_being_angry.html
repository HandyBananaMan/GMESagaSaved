<p>The news was a bit different today. Yall need to understand everyone here is a fucking person. Not some robot capable of spouting the god damned fucking future. Stop with your "shill" this, "shill" that, 1m isn't probable this, your a paper hand that. Fuck off. I'm just waiting for the moon, and now you've pissed off my anchorman. Now I'm pissed. I like reading his news(still his opinion). If he leaves, Ima be pissed. I like to do my own reading, and make my own conclusions. I use rensole as a standard to see what "other" people might think. How can I do that when y'all are making him thinking of quitting. This man has done so much for us. How dare you say this to him. Have some respect for the apes around you doing actual work. People get PAID the big bucks to do this shit. And you're getting alot of it for the effort and time put in. Aka free. Cash poor, time rich. Use your time for functional things, like mentally masterbating somewhere else than shitting on somebody doing their thing.  I don't religiously believe what I read, which some people here, DO. Scary ASF. You do you. Ima like just keep reading and doing my thing, if you could just do your thing, but if  you don't have anything nice to say, don't fucking say it. Discussion for DD is the back bone of the sub. Attacking people. Not on. You want to rip something apart? Do that to the DD. Rant over. Please don't leave. Lurk maybe. But don't leave.</p>
