There has been an influx of new accounts trying to say the floor is $5k - $10k. They are very desperate and are trying to change the consensus of the floor being $10,000,000 BECAUSE THEY KNOW ITS POSSIBLE. ANY TIME YOU SEE SHILL ACCOUNTS SPREADING THESE LOW NUMBERS, THIS SHOULD GIVE YOU CONFIDENCE IN OUR FLOOR! STAY STRONG APES AND DO NOT LOWER YOUR FLOORS!
