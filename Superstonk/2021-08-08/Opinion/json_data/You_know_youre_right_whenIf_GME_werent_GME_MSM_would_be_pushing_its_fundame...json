    "selftext": "Take GME off as a name and look at the company as a whole. No debt, 1.2billion in cash. Restructuring business model. A proven successful man at the helm. Poaching employees from huge tech companies with almost exclusively company share incentives. A loyal customer base. Best customer service. Entering cryp toe and eneftee market. \n\nIf this were any other company, MSM would be telling EVERYONE to buy buy buy. Instead, they push companies like Uber who haven\u2019t shown a profit in years, have massive debt, and are only projecting profitability if they lower wages or get self driving cars and can fully eliminate their workforce. \n\nGme is worth buying even if there wasn\u2019t MOASS, and the fact that MSM won\u2019t even acknowledge it, is very telling.",
