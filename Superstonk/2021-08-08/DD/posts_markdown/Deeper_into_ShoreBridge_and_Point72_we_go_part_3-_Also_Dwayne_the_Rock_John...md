Okay... so this thing went left pretty quick. 

First, credits to u/wladeczek44: made some API thingy (not sure what that is but it was really helpful!) Half the credit should honestly go to this beautiful ape who kept my ADHD ass focused :D

With that said.... let's dive right in.

&#x200B;

Part 1: Ex-CIA, FBI, and SEC working for Point72

&#x200B;

First, here's a link - [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001465991/000089914021000108/xslFormDX01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001465991/000089914021000108/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)

or for those who enjoy images, here are 2 things that stand out -

&#x200B;

![Cayman Islands, again](https://preview.redd.it/bfr6ek3f69g71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=50b32daa928a714ddf5529ab3cbff7ed15e5ec81)

And this (same filing)

&#x200B;

![Vincent Tortorella - Remember that name](https://preview.redd.it/fuht6oaq69g71.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7c4e8252dca85d903257e83e74b3e9eb7312774)

Here, we see someone who is Ex-DOJ assist in the transfer of offshore funds. Criminals in their natural habitat :D

Turns out, there's a whole "surveillance" division of Point72, with ex-CIA, FBI, and SEC. Let's take a look-

To boil it all down, we have law enforcement involved in crime - all in plain sight. Isn't that something?

&#x200B;

Part 2: Redbird and ShoreBridge

&#x200B;

After taking that brief look at the blatant offshore money moves, we find ourselves another name tied to ShoreBridge - Redbird Series 2019, LP (who in the fuck named that shit)

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001779883/000183435621000001/xslFormDX01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001779883/000183435621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)

&#x200B;

![I normally find Red Birds quite calming, like the Angry Bird](https://preview.redd.it/d9ee93ohc9g71.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a9f9bf589b60fe413d108fdc70ec1ee20ad5e9)

We've got RedBird dumping shares into... ShoreBridge. Take a look -

But wait, there's more!

&#x200B;

We have Goldman! Along with Probitas Funds Group, LLC and Grafine Capital Partners LLC. 

Finally, let's look at the bottom-

&#x200B;

![Gerry Cardinale, founder of RedBird](https://preview.redd.it/04iif2d0e9g71.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&s=27c61dcc7c0e343ce493a350688feecc5cf754ca)

Let's take a look at Gerry and Redbird.

Part 3: Gerry's Friends: Dwayne Johnson (and his wife), also Larry Ellison

[https://www.redbirdcap.com/people/#member-406-info](https://www.redbirdcap.com/people/#member-406-info)

&#x200B;

![An Overview of Gerry](https://preview.redd.it/o72sqdi9f9g71.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab80a83acdc3d6ef5aca3db89a41a90d9fe0206)

Our main man is former Goldman Sachs. Owns all these massive companies. Here's some more.

&#x200B;

![This man has connections, to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/g3f9t50sf9g71.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9009a2ca98844d2c091c095aaf21e5e7b869abb)

See, told you Dwayne Johnson was here! Along with a... bunch of other people/companies. It begs the question - why are all of these massive entities tied to this one guy, who sells stock to ShoreBridge (Cayman bank account)? Definitely worth looking into.

Boiled down - Dwayne Johnson and other large people/companies are business partners with a financial criminal.

I haven't slept in 18 hours, so I'm getting some rest soon. I barely scraped the surface, other eyes should be digging as well. Support the hustle!

&#x200B;

TL;DR- ShoreBridge bought stock in Redbird Capital, whose founder (ex-Goldman) is business partners with Larry&David Ellison, Dwayne Johnson&wife, and tons of sports leagues.

Edit- just realized Dany Garcia and the Rock have been divorced for quite some time. I really need to get out from under my rock sometimes
