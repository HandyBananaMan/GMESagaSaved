Half the credit should honestly go to this beautiful ape who kept my ADHD ass focused :D\n\nWith that said.... let's dive right in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 1: Ex-CIA, FBI, and SEC working for Point72\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, here's a link - [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001465991/000089914021000108/xslFormDX01/primary\\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001465991/000089914021000108/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)\n\nor for those who enjoy images, here are 2 things that stand out -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cayman Islands, again](https://preview.redd.it/bfr6ek3f69g71.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=50b32daa928a714ddf5529ab3cbff7ed15e5ec81)\n\nAnd this (same filing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Vincent Tortorella - Remember that name](https://preview.redd.it/fuht6oaq69g71.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7c4e8252dca85d903257e83e74b3e9eb7312774)\n\nAnother link, another photo:\n\n[https://www.point72.com/leadership/vincent-tortorella/](https://www.point72.com/leadership/vincent-tortorella/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Vinny is Ex-Department of Justice](https://preview.redd.it/sbkkiqr779g71.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=e46be04c5d589e521ce15aa10fb2d591d1ca4e03)\n\nHere, we see someone who is Ex-DOJ assist in the transfer of offshore funds. Criminals in their natural habitat :D\n\nTurns out, there's a whole \"surveillance\" division of Point72, with ex-CIA, FBI, and SEC. Let's take a look-\n\n[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/cohen-seeks-law-experts-for-fund/](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/cohen-seeks-law-experts-for-fund/)\n\n(blocked by paywall unfortunately)\n\n[From NY Times](https://preview.redd.it/zl183irc99g71.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=c40ac5d9a35c9a917f5fc2b387caae7ebb0094b2)\n\nTo boil it all down, we have law enforcement involved in crime - all in plain sight. Isn't that something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 2: Redbird and ShoreBridge\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter taking that brief look at the blatant offshore money moves, we find ourselves another name tied to ShoreBridge - Redbird Series 2019, LP (who in the fuck named that shit)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001779883/000183435621000001/xslFormDX01/primary\\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001779883/000183435621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I normally find Red Birds quite calming, like the Angry Bird](https://preview.redd.it/d9ee93ohc9g71.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a9f9bf589b60fe413d108fdc70ec1ee20ad5e9)\n\nWe've got RedBird dumping shares into... ShoreBridge. Take a look -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Recipient #1](https://preview.redd.it/qnd570zvc9g71.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da48418df21f452f71dcdad05fbdc3ba37c8648)\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Recipient #2](https://preview.redd.it/6uf2bi34d9g71.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=d09e97cce077e99c4551859d1da8dddd4791ce0a)\n\nWe have Goldman! Along with Probitas Funds Group, LLC and Grafine Capital Partners LLC. \n\nFinally, let's look at the bottom-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gerry Cardinale, founder of RedBird](https://preview.redd.it/04iif2d0e9g71.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&s=27c61dcc7c0e343ce493a350688feecc5cf754ca)\n\nLet's take a look at Gerry and Redbird.\n\nPart 3: Gerry's Friends: Dwayne Johnson (and his wife), also Larry Ellison\n\n[https://www.redbirdcap.com/people/#member-406-info](https://www.redbirdcap.com/people/#member-406-info)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[An Overview of Gerry](https://preview.redd.it/o72sqdi9f9g71.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab80a83acdc3d6ef5aca3db89a41a90d9fe0206)\n\nOur main man is former Goldman Sachs. Owns all these massive companies. Here's some more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This man has connections, to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/g3f9t50sf9g71.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9009a2ca98844d2c091c095aaf21e5e7b869abb)\n\nSee, told you Dwayne Johnson was here! Along with a... bunch of other people/companies. It begs the question - why are all of these massive entities tied to this one guy, who sells stock to ShoreBridge (Cayman bank account)? Definitely worth looking into.\n\nBoiled down - Dwayne Johnson and other large people/companies are business partners with a financial criminal.\n\nI haven't slept in 18 hours, so I'm getting some rest soon. I barely scraped the surface, other eyes should be digging as well. Support the hustle!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- ShoreBridge bought stock in Redbird Capital, whose founder (ex-Goldman) is business partners with Larry&David Ellison, Dwayne Johnson&wife, and tons of sports leagues.\n\nEdit- just realized Dany Garcia and the Rock have been divorced for quite some time. I really need to get out from under my rock sometimes\n\nEdit#2: https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1374149156873367553?s=20 \ud83d\ude09",
