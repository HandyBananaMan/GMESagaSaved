<p>Okay... so this thing went left pretty quick. </p>
<p>First, credits to u/wladeczek44: made some API thingy (not sure what that is but it was really helpful!) Half the credit should honestly go to this beautiful ape who kept my ADHD ass focused :D</p>
<p>With that said.... let's dive right in.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Part 1: Ex-CIA, FBI, and SEC working for Point72</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First, here's a link - <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001465991/000089914021000108/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001465991/000089914021000108/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml</a></p>
<p>or for those who enjoy images, here are 2 things that stand out -</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Cayman Islands, again" src="https://preview.redd.it/bfr6ek3f69g71.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50b32daa928a714ddf5529ab3cbff7ed15e5ec81" /></p>
<p>And this (same filing)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Vincent Tortorella - Remember that name" src="https://preview.redd.it/fuht6oaq69g71.png?width=1255&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7c4e8252dca85d903257e83e74b3e9eb7312774" /></p>
<p>Another link, another photo:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Vinny is Ex-Department of Justice" src="https://preview.redd.it/sbkkiqr779g71.png?width=1185&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e46be04c5d589e521ce15aa10fb2d591d1ca4e03" /></p>
<p>Here, we see someone who is Ex-DOJ assist in the transfer of offshore funds. Criminals in their natural habitat :D</p>
<p>Turns out, there's a whole "surveillance" division of Point72, with ex-CIA, FBI, and SEC. Let's take a look-</p>

<p>To boil it all down, we have law enforcement involved in crime - all in plain sight. Isn't that something?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Part 2: Redbird and ShoreBridge</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After taking that brief look at the blatant offshore money moves, we find ourselves another name tied to ShoreBridge - Redbird Series 2019, LP (who in the fuck named that shit)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001779883/000183435621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001779883/000183435621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="I normally find Red Birds quite calming, like the Angry Bird" src="https://preview.redd.it/d9ee93ohc9g71.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17a9f9bf589b60fe413d108fdc70ec1ee20ad5e9" /></p>
<p>We've got RedBird dumping shares into... ShoreBridge. Take a look -</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Recipient #1" src="https://preview.redd.it/qnd570zvc9g71.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2da48418df21f452f71dcdad05fbdc3ba37c8648" /></p>
<p>But wait, there's more!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Recipient #2" src="https://preview.redd.it/6uf2bi34d9g71.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d09e97cce077e99c4551859d1da8dddd4791ce0a" /></p>
<p>We have Goldman! Along with Probitas Funds Group, LLC and Grafine Capital Partners LLC. </p>
<p>Finally, let's look at the bottom-</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Gerry Cardinale, founder of RedBird" src="https://preview.redd.it/04iif2d0e9g71.png?width=1321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27c61dcc7c0e343ce493a350688feecc5cf754ca" /></p>
<p>Let's take a look at Gerry and Redbird.</p>
<p>Part 3: Gerry's Friends: Dwayne Johnson (and his wife), also Larry Ellison</p>
<p><a href="https://www.redbirdcap.com/people/#member-406-info">https://www.redbirdcap.com/people/#member-406-info</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="An Overview of Gerry" src="https://preview.redd.it/o72sqdi9f9g71.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eab80a83acdc3d6ef5aca3db89a41a90d9fe0206" /></p>
<p>Our main man is former Goldman Sachs. Owns all these massive companies. Here's some more.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="This man has connections, to say the least" src="https://preview.redd.it/g3f9t50sf9g71.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9009a2ca98844d2c091c095aaf21e5e7b869abb" /></p>
<p>See, told you Dwayne Johnson was here! Along with a... bunch of other people/companies. It begs the question - why are all of these massive entities tied to this one guy, who sells stock to ShoreBridge (Cayman bank account)? Definitely worth looking into.</p>
<p>Boiled down - Dwayne Johnson and other large people/companies are business partners with a financial criminal.</p>
<p>I haven't slept in 18 hours, so I'm getting some rest soon. I barely scraped the surface, other eyes should be digging as well. Support the hustle!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR- ShoreBridge bought stock in Redbird Capital, whose founder (ex-Goldman) is business partners with Larry&amp;David Ellison, Dwayne Johnson&amp;wife, and tons of sports leagues.</p>
<p>Edit- just realized Dany Garcia and the Rock have been divorced for quite some time. I really need to get out from under my rock sometimes</p>
