Citadel is a gigantic, interconnected financial firm, but it is non-transparent and unregulated in critical respects, preventing effective oversight and accountability. That\u2019s why it is vital for Main Street Americans and retail investors to know whether or not it is a systemically significant firm, whether it poses a threat to the financial system and economy, and whether it should be regulated more comprehensively. CNBC\u2019s viewers, however, would not know those critical issues were pointedly discussed at the hearing or deleted from the video CNBC posted. CNBC should immediately restore the deleted parts of the video.\"\n\nTo hear Kelleher\u2019s concerns about Citadel\u2019s substantial presence in the financial markets without the regulatory oversight necessary to protect investors and markets, visit [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=chogYSWCA24&t=1218s). However, Kelleher\u2019s following comments, directly responding to a Republican witness\u2019s unqualified defense of Citadel, during the hearing capture the essence of his concerns: \u00a0\n\n\u201cIf Citadel shut down today, even for a day, that means 26 percent of all U.S. equities\u2019 volume in 8,900 listed securities would stop. It executes 47 percent of all U.S. listed retail volume. It represents 99 percent of the traded volume of 3,000 listed options. To say that the system would work perfectly fine if all that evaporated today and competitors would come into the market\u2014that may ultimately happen\u2014but until it ultimately happens, you're going to have a systemic event.\u00a0And to deny that is to deny reality.\u201d\n\nIf this was posted I will delete .",
