    "selftext": "Everything regarding NFT and a possible dividend at this point is pure speculation. Keep in mind to not be disappointed if the NFT things do not play out the way you imagine it.\n\nThe most likely usage oft NFTs in the gaming industry will be to make digital products like games resellable.\n\nThis would still be revolutionary and bullish AF for our company.\n\nGetting disapointed when the NFT thing turns out differently than expected has the potential to be the ultimate FUD.\n\nJust stick to the DD, buy, hold and manage your expectations.",
