    "selftext": "The guys who set out to catalog the various cognitive biases used themselves as the essential data points. They believed that as long as they weren\u2019t insane then the way they saw and reacted to the world should be similar to the way everybody else did too because we all share the same evolutionary hardware.\n\nSo when I think about my own journey since January, when I think about the rage that all the corruption and manipulation by the shfs has engendered in me, when I think about the due diligence showing GME to be a tech turnaround play for the ages, I can confidently assume that all the other apes out there have reacted similarly to those stimuli.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about everybody writing that they\u2019ve been buying more shares the whole time. That\u2019s one data point to take into consideration. But just as important for me is that I know I\u2019ve been buying a ton more the whole time and I know through cognitive psychology that everybody else is enraged by what\u2019s happened like I am and excited about the turnaround like I am, and thus I can confidently infer that those stimuli have caused the same behavior in them as it has in me, to compulsively buy shares of GME without ever selling a single share.",
