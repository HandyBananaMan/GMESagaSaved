<p>Imagine the collective of multiple international institutional and individual investors, European Union, South Korea, Japan, China(?), UK, Vatican, Australia, Austria, Antarctica, etc</p>

<p>I remember reading something about French government asking SEC to look into something, but the SEC was all like "thanks for calling us, it is an internal issue, we will keep you posted, stay posted to our emails" or something along those lines. Of course, we have seen Brazil been involved too, so Im sure even penguins got something here to say.</p>
