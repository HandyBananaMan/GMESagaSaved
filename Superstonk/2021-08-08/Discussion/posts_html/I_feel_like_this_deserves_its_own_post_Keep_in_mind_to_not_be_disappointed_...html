<p>Everything regarding NFT and a possible dividend at this point is pure speculation. Keep in mind to not be disappointed if the NFT things do not play out the way you imagine it.</p>
<p>The most likely usage oft NFTs in the gaming industry will be to make digital products like games resellable.</p>
<p>This would still be revolutionary and bullish AF for our company.</p>
<p>Getting disapointed when the NFT thing turns out differently than expected has the potential to be the ultimate FUD.</p>
<p>Just stick to the DD, buy, hold and manage your expectations.</p>
