Hey all, I did some digging into Point72 today. I've been meaning to take a peek, since whenever Point72 is remotely discussed, strange things start happening (major forum sliding on Superstonk. Remember the lego thing?)

That said, I found this gem in the SEC archive. It's a Form D filing (a sale of stock without the hassle of an IPO), dated January 29th, 2021 (great timing Steve).

 Now that begs the question - who's the one buying stock? And for how much? Look no further.

 How much you ask?

 Okay, so we have a buyer, and we have an amount. Now, I've searched all 3 of the major subs for Shorebridge, and I haven't seen it mentioned. I took this opportunity to dig a little bit. Oh look -

So.... what does this mean? I'm not entirely sure. Kinda hoping you guys can provide insight as you always do. Biggest takeaways for me - the \*timing\* (January 29th), the \*amount\* (5.3 billion ain't no chump change), and the \*location\* (Cayman Islands?? Could you be any less discrete). My novice opinion is that this may be a shell company, but I encourage people to poke holes in this.

TL;DR- Point72 sold 5.3 billion worth of stock to Shorebridge Capital Advisors, LLC on January 29th, who are incorporated in the Cayman Islands.

Edit- credit to u/throwawaylurker012 for this excellent info- "Hey OP stellar goddamn find! Thought this info might be useful as well for your post whether on here or super stonk!

1. Saw someone else found the Douglas Blagdon name affiliated with the account. WaPo published Bloomberg's piece by Hema Parmar, Saijel Kishan, etc. on "Fallen Hedge Fund’s Head Among Investors Getting PPP Relief". They wrote in the article last July 2020:**"ShoreBridge Capital Partners, a firm that helped billionaire Steven Cohen raise money from hedge fund investors after a regulatory ban on him managing other people’s assets was lifted, got approval for a $150,000 to $350,000 loan on April 13. ShoreBridge founder Douglas Blagdon didn’t return messages seeking comment."** (Blagdon and Cohen are utter assholes for this btw, taking PPP loans during a pandemic.)*Source:* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/fallen-hedge-funds-head-among-investors-getting-ppp-relief/2020/07/06/c0f26cd6-bfee-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/fallen-hedge-funds-head-among-investors-getting-ppp-relief/2020/07/06/c0f26cd6-bfee-11ea-8908-68a2b9eae9e0_story.html)
2. You're right, they have those Cayman Island filings not just through the islands in general **but Ugland House, which was posted about not just by Atobitt** but also in a semi-recent TIL ([https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/k8ks9i/til\_of\_the\_ugland\_house\_a\_registered\_office\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/k8ks9i/til_of_the_ugland_house_a_registered_office_in/)). It's marked on those SEC filings as "pooled/other investment fund" but declines to disclose issuer size (revenue range, aggregate net value).

3. **Seems incorporated in 2018**, with 1st share sale Jan. 28, 2018 (am I reading that right?)
4. By Feb. 2018 had 8 investors during a share offering of about 111 milly invested.By Feb. 2019 had 72 investors, in an amended filing saying now 568 milly.By Feb. 2020 had 98 investors, in an amended filing saying now 679 milly.**By Feb. 2021 had 108 investors, in an amended filing saying now 819 milly.**Guessing they file this amended filing every Feb, guess we'll see what happens by next Feb."
