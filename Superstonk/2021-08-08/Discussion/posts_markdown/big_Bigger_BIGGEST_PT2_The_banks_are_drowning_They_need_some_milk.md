This is not financial advice, not DD, not presenting any of this as fact, just one big ass list. The 40,000 character/post is limiting me, so I'll have to break it up into parts. I started with the banks, so PT 2 is first. Let the sources speak for themselves

PT 1: Hedge Funds, Market Makers, Brokers, and the DTCC

PT 2: Banks

PT 3: Central banks, The Federal Reserve, Ex and current government officials, and BlackRock

Wall Street's cooked books fueled the financial crisis in 2008. **It's happening again**

“Overall,” they write, “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5% or more in 28% of loans.” This was just the average, however: Some originators — including an unusual company called **Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley — were significantly worse, “having more than 35% of their loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatement.”** The below graph from the paper illustrates just how prevalent this issue is with some of Wall Street’s biggest names:

With the EU recently barring more big banks like JP Morgan & Chase and Citigroup from participating in their bonds sales it looks like they are suspicious of them as well in corroborating in market collusion to a similar degree.

[The big banks just increased their dividends, some doubled them. Come with me and Let’s head back to 08](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oa371g/the_big_banks_just_increased_their_dividends_some/)

##[JP Morgan (JPM)](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4442972-jp-morgan-growing-dividend-once-again-worth-a-buy)

During the years prior to the 2008 crisis, JP Morgan (JPM ) offered a dividend yield around 3%. By 2008, as JPM’s share price began to crumble, its yield rose above 4%. By February of 2009, JPM’s yield dropped to just 0.55% when the company cut its dividend for the first time since 1990 from 38 cents to 5 cents per share quarterly. This drastic change came as a surprise to many investors. Although many banks had recently slashed dividends, JPM was still considered one of the most stable investment banks, and was one of the last to cut its payout.

This dividend reduction came soon after the company received $25 billion in TARP bailout funds. JPM’s CEO Jamie Dimon reported that the cut was unrelated to the bailout, and said that this cut was made to allow JPM to have more financial flexibility. The 87% dividend cut helped the bank save $5 billion annually, which freed up capital to repay bailout funds.

##[Wells Fargo (WFC)](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/13/wells-fargos-dividend-hike-and-stock-buyback-plan/)

San Francisco-based Wells Fargo (WFC ) kept up with its peers by offering over a 3% dividend yield in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, WFC’s yield shot up to 4.5% as its share price fell, similar to other banks at the time.

Just two months after the bank’s purchase of ailing Wachovia in March 2009, the bank cut its dividend 85% from 34 cents to just 5 cents per share, leaving shareholders with a mere 0.70% yield. The cut allowed WFC to save $5 billion a year to help fund its toxic mortgage losses.

##[Bank of America (BAC)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210721005800/en/Bank-of-America-Increases-Common-Stock-Dividend-17-Percent)

Charlotte, NC-based Bank of America (BAC ) traded at around $50 prior to the 2008 crisis, and had a dividend yield that exceeded 5% in 2007 and reached 7% by 2008. The banking giant was historically a great choice for dividend investors, but that all changed in 2009 when the bank was forced to cut its dividend in order to comply with government restrictions after taking TARP bailout funds.

In 2009, BAC cut its quarterly dividend to just 1 cent per share. This left investors with just a 0.23% dividend yield. Since the dividend cut, BAC has made attempts to raise its dividend, but has failed to gain government approval.

##Citigroup ©

In 2006, Citigroup (C ) had a dividend yield of about 4% which increased to over 4.5% in 2007. By 2008, the New York City-based bank had a dividend yield of over 7% as its stock price began to fall. In 2008, Citi was bailed out by the U.S. government for the first time and given $25 billion in TARP bailout funds. By February 2009, Citi had received its third government bailout. The government owned one-third of its shares.

To comply with the government regulations, the bank suspended its dividend entirely from 2009-2010. In March 2011, the company resumed its dividend, offering a yield of just 0.10%, or 1 cent per share. During this time, C also did a reverse stock split of 10 to 1, making its shares worth approximately $44.

[This POS is calling Apes Communists and Marxist for holding GME. 2 terms in which boomers really hate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oz8w0g/this_pos_is_calling_apes_communists_and_marxist/) He also adds that Apes hate "the rich". He failed to mention that holding GME has nothing to do with the rich, but rather Apes hate criminals like himself.

Last week, our favorite clown Jim Cramer said he would [buy Wells Fargo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oghre1/last_week_our_favorite_clown_jim_cramer_said_he/) and buy it aggressively. Today, Wells Fargo is withdrawing personal credit.

Jim Cramer says [there won't be a crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VccFFQk_1k). Let's not forget the time he went on public TV and told the world in '08 that Bear Stearns was fine, [6 days before their collapse.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUkbdjetlY8)

#["Citadel is in great shape](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oyswp2/cramer_on_citadel_in_2008_smh/), because they said so. See, this is how it works. it's the way it's played, and guys like me can't even say anything other than they're in great shape. **You can't talk about Citadel**, because if you say they're not, he will say prove it, and if you say he is in great shape and someone listens to you, then **well thats dangerous too.** So this is a crisis of confidence" -Jim Cramer


“If Citadel tells me they’re in great shape, they’re in great shape! If Citadel tells me they want to clap my cheeks, I let em give a standing ovation! If Citadel offers me a soda, I’ll take the Pepsi because they deserve all the coke! Btw do you have any more coke?”

It’s very clear that you don’t fuck with Disney (hu-ha!). He clearly saying without saying that speaking out against Citadel is not something to be fucked with. Kenny has his was and will ruin you in some way shape or form. He openly admits that saying they are in good shape is dangerous, but that he has no choice. Instead he uses an overplay of his statements to try to get the message across that they aren’t fine. Something that clearly went right over the reporters head as well. You can see his whole demeanor change when he starts to “get real with her”. Cokehead fades away to what seems like a time when he was warned not to ever go against Citadel. This video is actually super intriguing once you dive into the subtext of what is coming out of his mouth. Give it another watch, get off his nuts, and just listen to what he says, watch his body language change, and read into what he’s saying.

As you can see, CNBC, and especially [JIM CRAMER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nlovio/cramer_why_why_whying_in_higher_quality/) will [lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIfixbq_u0Q) and [manipulate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsyccq/jon_stewart_2009/) it's viewers.

&nbsp;

DIDI IPO:

>The Company has granted the underwriters an option, exercisable within 30 days from the date of the final prospectus, to purchase up to an aggregate of 47,520,000 additional ADSs at US$14.00 per ADS.

&nbsp;

[A week after](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4445455-didi-stock-performance-since-ipo), on July 12, DiDi announced that regulators had taken down 25 other related mobile apps owned and operated by the company from app stores as well, in what could be termed as a final blow to the gut. This regulatory crackdown took a toll on DIDI ever since the stock debuted, and the **stock is down more than 30% from its IPO price already.**




>**Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as active joint bookrunners and representatives of the underwriters for the offering.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Any of those names look familiar to you? Did some digging into **Tiger Brokers**, because of Bill Hwang's [Archegos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archegos_Capital_Management) connection to a group called the Tiger Cubs. Could they be related? Lets find out.

I was going to continue looking into [ROBTHEHOOD'S IPO](https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-stock-falls-with-early-investors-set-to-sell-shares-11628177971), but now, I'm tired. I'll leave you with this:

>Robinhood Stock Drops After News of Early Investors Set to Sell Shares
**The investing platform won’t receive the proceeds from the sales**

&nbsp;

Of course not, that would be to obvious! ^^cough **PUMP AND DUMP** ^^cough

>The filing names more than a dozen shareholders who bought notes that could later be converted to shares ahead of the company’s initial public offering. Among the selling shareholders are **tech private-equity firm Andreessen Horowitz, Iconiq Capital LLC, Greenoaks Capital and Ribbit Capital LP.**

&nbsp;

Just looking into [Andreeseen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/about/team/), I found this: 

#Note: Each bullet point is from a different team member.

- Prior to joining Andreessen Horowitz, Kimberly was a consultant at **McKinsey & Company** advising companies on strategy, go-to-market, and operations. She has also spent time at the World Bank in their finance & markets practice, in tech investment banking at Goldman Sachs, and at a journalism non-profit in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

- Daren was a Data Scientist at SVB Capital where he developed and managed a proprietary data and analytics platform. Before that, he completed financial training programs at **Morgan Stanley and State Street.**

- he started her career in consulting at **McKinsey** in San Francisco.

- Prior to joining a16z, he co-founded Frank, a social lending platform that used behavioral economics to make it easy to lend and borrow money with friends and family. He began his career at **McKinsey** & Co, where he was an engagement manager in the TMT practice.

[The firm that built the house of Enron](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/mar/24/enron.theobserver)

>**Enron** is the house that McKinsey rebuilt. The brightest minds at the world’s most prestigious consulting firm helped turn the lumbering old-economy gas distribution dinosaur into a new-economy success story envied by every corporation in America. 

&nbsp;

##[Goldman is Evil but McKinsey is worse](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/02/goldman-is-evil-but-mckinsey-is-worse.html)

&nbsp;

>It is remarkable the way that McKinsey goes from train wreck to train wreck yet manages to depict itself as some sort of Corporate America Zelig: ever on the scene but not doing much of anything in particular. This is despite the fact (for instance) that McKinsey was singularly responsible for the biggest value destroying deal of all time, save maybe Bayer’s purchase of Monsanto, which was the Time Warner acquisition of AOL. McKinsey pitched AOL to the Time Warner board five times and the board had the spine to reject it only four times.

Guess who used to work at McKinsey? Why it’s your [favorite transportation secretary!](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/pete-buttigieg-mckinsey/603421/)
