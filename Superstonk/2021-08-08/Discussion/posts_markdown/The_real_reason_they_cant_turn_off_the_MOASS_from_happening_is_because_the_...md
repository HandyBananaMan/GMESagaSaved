Imagine the collective of multiple international institutional and individual investors, European Union, South Korea, Japan, China(?), UK, Vatican, Australia, Austria, Antarctica, etc

What an international mess it would be to have virtually (potentially literally) every country with access to the internet and reddit with individual investors trying to apply pressure on the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, a call of JUSTICE, and FAIRNESS.

I remember reading something about French government asking SEC to look into something, but the SEC was all like "thanks for calling us, it is an internal issue, we will keep you posted, stay posted to our emails" or something along those lines. Of course, we have seen Brazil been involved too, so Im sure even penguins got something here to say.
