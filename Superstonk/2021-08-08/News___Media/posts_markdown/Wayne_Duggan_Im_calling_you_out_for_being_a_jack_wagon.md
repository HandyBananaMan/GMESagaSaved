Wayne Duggan, I’m calling you out for being a jack wagon. In your article titled “how GameStop investors can make their lives easier,” You explain that many people think short sellers are rigging the market, then you tell them that they shouldn’t bet against hedge funds because they’ll lose, then you say turn around plans don’t work and point to Sears and blockbuster, two examples of companies shorted out of existence, and then you claim hedge funds and financial journalists don’t have a symbiotic relationship. Fuck off you manipulative piece of human scum.
