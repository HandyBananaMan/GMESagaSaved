In your article titled \u201chow GameStop investors can make their lives easier,\u201d You explain that many people think short sellers are rigging the market, then you tell them that they shouldn\u2019t bet against hedge funds because they\u2019ll lose, then you say turn around plans don\u2019t work and point to Sears and blockbuster, two examples of companies shorted out of existence, and then you claim hedge funds and financial journalists don\u2019t have a symbiotic relationship. Fuck off you manipulative piece of human scum.",
