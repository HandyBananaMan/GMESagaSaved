~~This is just a text post, so I don't suspect it'll get much traction,~~ BUT for all those who do see this, **be encouraged!!**

Every week (aka every pay period), diamond handed apes ðŸ™ŒðŸ’Ž are buying more of this beautiful stock.

Regardless of how many paper hands buy, shills sow FUD, hedgey tactics come this way, or how often we see the price go down on the way up, there are more and more holders who **will** hold. What's more, the forever puddle grows.

It's like that superhero who gets stronger the longer the fight goes on (anyone know which one that is? I think the Hulk comes close to that concept).

It's like Eithen Aurelius in Cradle grinding away with the Heaven and Earth Purification Wheel, building his madra pool to unfathomable depths.

It's like getting a few extra precious seconds to beat up the Sandbag with Yoshi to KO it to the moon (something that we never got, but always wanted).

It's like holding onto that OG Charizard card for another year, knowing one day it'll be worth even more fortunes (I saw your post, friend).

It's like GME stonk holders hanging on forever, because that's what the Buffet dude talked about and we learned a thing or two about the market.

I could go on...

I know you smooth brains will hodl. I know there's enough of you out there with balls of steel. Even if we watch the price fall off on the way up, I **know** there are enough silver backs and nerves of diamond apes who are going to hold onto that rocket with their heafty scrotes made of weird space metal that's harder than the moon itself.

Don't know when we're going up. But we will.

Hodl tight. Hodl right.
