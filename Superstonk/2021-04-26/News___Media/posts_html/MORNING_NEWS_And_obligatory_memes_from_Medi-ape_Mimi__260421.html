<p><strong>DTCC liquidity risk testing on 26th April 21 - THATS TODAY!</strong></p>

<p>"What's interesting here is, this is an annual test which was last completed 24th Aug20, this test has effectively been brought forward to 26th April 21. The 2019 test was conducted on 26th Aug 2019. I feel it adds to the general conscious that something is brewing behind the scenes relating to leverage.</p>
<p>Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility (“CCLF®”) is an integral part of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s (“FICC”) role as central counterparty under the Government Securities Division (“GSD”) and the Mortgage Backed Securities Division (“MBSD”). On an annual basis, FICC conducts a mandatory CCLF test with all GSD Netting Members and MBSD Clearing Members in order to satisfy the requirements of a covered clearing agency with respect to its management of the liquidity risk.</p>

<p>"There was simply speculation about the US flag, democracy and voting. It just felt to me like we are missing something - why at half-mast - people just staying something about a vice president who died before Ryan was Born. It all seemed a stretch to me and to be honest (have you got your tin-foil hat on?) like they were trying to distract me from its real meaning!</p>
<p>So firstly, we have to ask why half-mast? So A flag that is half-mast is either on its way up or way down, right? So perhaps that's part of the hint, is the flag going up or down?</p>
<p>As I discovered, <em>THAT</em> is what Flag and Pennant Analysis are all about - finding out if the stock is about to go up or down.</p>

<p>" Here is a different way to look at the OTC GME data. It should be abundantly clear that what is going on in the OTC dark pools is extremely abnormal. Citadel and Virtu market makers seem to be doing a whole lot of OTC trading. How did they get hundreds of millions of shares? What about Two Sigma? Why are the same entities trading so much volume so frequently in the OTC marketplace? Why did the number of shares / trade decrease so drastically beginning 1/25? Winter is coming. Are any of them wearing any clothes??? "</p>

<p>"Robinhood stepped up again with some serious high frequency OTC trading. Did anything happen that week? Oh yeah, the GME price experienced a huge drop from 280 to 210 on 3/15 and then to around 172 on 3/16. They didn't switch things up at all from their previous attacks. 297,276 shares traded 297,194 times for an average of 1.00 shares/trade. "</p>

<p>"The wave of amateur Korean traders has been inspired by a US campaign against hedge funds that had made bearish wagers on companies such as gaming retail chain GameStop. Kstreetbets, an online forum that targets short-sellers, is named after the popular Reddit group r/WallStreetBets</p>
<p>Kstreetbets members call themselves “ants” and have dubbed their cause “the Donghak Ant Movement”, a reference to a failed uprising by farmers in 1894 against corrupt aristocrats and growing foreign influence in Korea. Today, many Korean retail traders feel as though they have been exploited by local institutional and international investors</p>
<p>The “ants” are testing their political power by demanding regulatory changes in the stock market. Some had called for a campaign against ruling party candidates in mayoral by-elections this month in Seoul and Busan, the country’s two biggest cities, and in the presidential vote next year."</p>

<p>" Over-voting does not directly and immediately trigger a share recall or force shorts to cover. It does provide the company with information on the total votes cast, which it could use as evidence of massive naked shorting of its shares and consequently the fraudulent creation of millions of shares. The company may publicize this information, which would refute the narrative that all shorts covered and would put the SEC and the NYSE on notice that this has happened and needs to be investigated and resolved immediately. Vote your shares. "</p>

<p>"GameStop had a <a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-results">not-so-great Q1 in 2020</a>, with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Sales: $1,021.0M</li>
<li>Gross Profit: $282.4M</li>
<li>Net Income (Loss): ($165.7M)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which, looks even worse compared to their <a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2019-results">Q1 2019 numbers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Net Sales: $1,547.7M</li>
<li>Gross Profit: $471.2M</li>
<li>Net Income: $6.8M</li>
</ul>
<p>Now obviously their Q1 2020 numbers were impacted significantly by COVID-19, which must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Anyways, given the weak performance in last year's Q1, GameStop could potentially have a blowout quarter this Q1 (relative to Q1 2020 - and, potentially, in general)."</p>

<p>The NSCC along with the DTC is complicit in defrauding America's investors and its corporations through a Share Borrowing Program designed to allow its participating members to reset their FTDs while maintaining an air of innocence by professing it is powerless to enforce buy-ins due to a rule that they themselves implemented to uphold a lender's identity.</p>
<p>I'll let Dr. Acosta have the last word:</p>
<p><strong><em>“</em></strong> *When this very same party (the DTCC and its subdivisions) that also has 15 of the 16 separate sources of empowerment to execute buy-ins ALSO pleads to be “powerless” to do buy-ins then I’d say we have some “issues” to deal with especially when the financial benefactors of this acting to be “powerless” are the owners of the clearance and settlement system and the bosses of these management teams."*<em>Dr. Jim DeCosta</em></p>
<p>Unless the SEC steps in and force the criminal organization that is the DTCC to clean up its act, this charade will continue and nothing has changed since <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72404/s72404-14.pdf">2004</a> when the Stock Borrowing Program first came into effect.</p>
