<p>Edit: Iâ€™m a dumb, high ape so this isnâ€™t financial advice, obviously.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Donâ€™t forget to vote! And only do it through links provided by GameStopâ€™s official site or your broker!</p>
<p>With GameStop selling the 3.5m shares at market value, they were able to sneak the sales to retail and longs since hedgies werenâ€™t covering.</p>
<p>They also timed it perfectly with the FTD cycle, allowing this catalyst along with less selling pressure to cut gravity in half for our rocket.</p>
<p>They also now have half a billion in cash to announce an acquisition, (edit: ~~potentially riot games since Ryan Cohen tweeted that clenched fist and thatâ€™s their logo? Or~~ maybe the common speculation of SLG?) a catalyst in itself.</p>
<p>In addition, they announced this after hours so any price increase wouldnâ€™t be subject to halts. Meaning it can keep going up before open tomorrow and potentially get to margin call levels.</p>
<p>The countdown is over. The rocket is taking off SOON. BUY AND HOLD WITH DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.</p>

<p>Edit 3: holy fuck what if Ryan Cohenâ€™s Ted Tweet wasnâ€™t just about bears shaking or bear bonds or whatever, what if it was also about doing something in private that turned out to be something we didnâ€™t expect?????</p>
