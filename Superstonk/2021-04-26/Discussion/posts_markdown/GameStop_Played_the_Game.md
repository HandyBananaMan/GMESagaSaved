Edit: Iâ€™m a dumb, high ape so this isnâ€™t financial advice, obviously.

Edit 2: Donâ€™t forget to vote! And only do it through links provided by GameStopâ€™s official site or your broker!

With GameStop selling the 3.5m shares at market value, they were able to sneak the sales to retail and longs since hedgies werenâ€™t covering.

They also timed it perfectly with the FTD cycle, allowing this catalyst along with less selling pressure to cut gravity in half for our rocket.

They also now have half a billion in cash to announce an acquisition, (edit: ~~potentially riot games since Ryan Cohen tweeted that clenched fist and thatâ€™s their logo? Or~~ maybe the common speculation of SLG?) a catalyst in itself.

In addition, they announced this after hours so any price increase wouldnâ€™t be subject to halts. Meaning it can keep going up before open tomorrow and potentially get to margin call levels.

The countdown is over. The rocket is taking off SOON. BUY AND HOLD WITH DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

Edit 3: holy fuck what if Ryan Cohenâ€™s Ted Tweet wasnâ€™t just about bears shaking or bear bonds or whatever, what if it was also about doing something in private that turned out to be something we didnâ€™t expect?????
