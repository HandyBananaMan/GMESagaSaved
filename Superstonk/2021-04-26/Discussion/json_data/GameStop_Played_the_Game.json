And only do it through links provided by GameStop\u2019s official site or your broker!\n\nWith GameStop selling the 3.5m shares at market value, they were able to sneak the sales to retail and longs since hedgies weren\u2019t covering.\n\nThey also timed it perfectly with the FTD cycle, allowing this catalyst along with less selling pressure to cut gravity in half for our rocket.\n\nThey also now have half a billion in cash to announce an acquisition, (edit: ~~potentially riot games since Ryan Cohen tweeted that clenched fist and that\u2019s their logo? Or~~ maybe the common speculation of SLG?) a catalyst in itself.\n\nIn addition, they announced this after hours so any price increase wouldn\u2019t be subject to halts. Meaning it can keep going up before open tomorrow and potentially get to margin call levels.\n\nThe countdown is over. The rocket is taking off SOON. BUY AND HOLD WITH DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nEdit 3: holy fuck what if Ryan Cohen\u2019s Ted Tweet wasn\u2019t just about bears shaking or bear bonds or whatever, what if it was also about doing something in private that turned out to be something we didn\u2019t expect?????",
