<p>For those of you directly messaging me with questions to ask in the AMA, please save them for tomorrow!</p>
<p>u/redchessqueen99 will be posting an AMA intake forum where questions will be selected based on YOUR upvotes. This gives you total control, as a collective, and eliminates the need for us to stream so many questions, live.</p>
<p>I will make sure to get to as many of these as I can.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>EDIT: I have also been asked to address counter DD on the HOC post. Before I do so, please wait for the AMA. Dr. T has provided me with feedback, personally <em>(IKR, super stoked).</em></p>
<p>The reason I haven't removed my post is because she didn't argue my message. Instead, she provided <em>VALUABLE</em> insight into the problem, as well as clarified some of my talking points. We want to make sure to give her <em>PLENTY</em> of time to address these, as they relate 100% to the narrative within <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Short-Greedy-Streets-Failure/dp/1910151343">Naked, Short, and Greedy</a>. So without spoiling the convo, I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>Finally, we will transition to some of my data points that are building the HOC II. This will give our listeners 100% disclosure into the talking points, BEFORE they are posted. This should help solidify our credibility before the HOC II is released.</p>
