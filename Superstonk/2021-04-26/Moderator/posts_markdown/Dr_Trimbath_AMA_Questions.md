For those of you directly messaging me with questions to ask in the AMA, please save them for tomorrow!

u/redchessqueen99 will be posting an AMA intake forum where questions will be selected based on YOUR upvotes. This gives you total control, as a collective, and eliminates the need for us to stream so many questions, live.

I will make sure to get to as many of these as I can.

Thank you

EDIT: I have also been asked to address counter DD on the HOC post. Before I do so, please wait for the AMA. Dr. T has provided me with feedback, personally *(IKR, super stoked).*

The reason I haven't removed my post is because she didn't argue my message. Instead, she provided *VALUABLE* insight into the problem, as well as clarified some of my talking points. We want to make sure to give her *PLENTY* of time to address these, as they relate 100% to the narrative within [Naked, Short, and Greedy](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Short-Greedy-Streets-Failure/dp/1910151343). So without spoiling the convo, I'll leave it at that.

Finally, we will transition to some of my data points that are building the HOC II. This will give our listeners 100% disclosure into the talking points, BEFORE they are posted. This should help solidify our credibility before the HOC II is released.
