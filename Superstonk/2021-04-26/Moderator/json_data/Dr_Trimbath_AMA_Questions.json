This gives you total control, as a collective, and eliminates the need for us to stream so many questions, live.\n\nI will make sure to get to as many of these as I can.\n\nThank you\n\nEDIT: I have also been asked to address counter DD on the HOC post. Before I do so, please wait for the AMA. Dr. T has provided me with feedback, personally *(IKR, super stoked).*\n\nThe reason I haven't removed my post is because she didn't argue my message. Instead, she provided *VALUABLE* insight into the problem, as well as clarified some of my talking points. We want to make sure to give her *PLENTY* of time to address these, as they relate 100% to the narrative within [Naked, Short, and Greedy](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Short-Greedy-Streets-Failure/dp/1910151343). So without spoiling the convo, I'll leave it at that.\n\nFinally, we will transition to some of my data points that are building the HOC II. This will give our listeners 100% disclosure into the talking points, BEFORE they are posted. This should help solidify our credibility before the HOC II is released.\n\n&#x200B;",
