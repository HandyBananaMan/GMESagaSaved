    "selftext": "This is a combination of DD, Discussion, and Opinion.  I've given it the DD flair because I think the topic is important as is the actual DD within it. I'm also reposting this because I think it's important that we address the FUD that we're accidentally spreading ourselves, stuff like asking everyone to email the SEC but then delaying the SEC because they have to read every comment. \n\nAlso, I apologize for no emojis, ape-talk, and confirmation bias.  I think it's important to really focus on the facts here and leave that to other posters!\n\n**There are short summaries at the end of each section if you're lazy.**\n\nI'm sure everyone has seen the posts about [CODE RED](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mx887u/code_red_subreddit_weekend_update/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and increasing the karma requirements for posts.  This is a great move towards improving the state of this sub but I don't think it's going to change much.\n\n**Why?**\n\nBecause the shills are massively outweighed by our own members who massively duplicate posts, flood the sub with memes and images with no sources, which then get picked up by DD, which then get voted by the thousands, then gets picked up by big names and included in dailies.\n\nI'm going to try to be less aggressive in this post because in previous ones I was a bit of a dick, sorry u/dwellerofthecrags!  Anyway, I'm going to perform some Due Diligence on where misinformation has come from and how it's been spread, not by shills, but by us.  I'm also going to add in some info at the end of each section to keep an eye on when looking at DD.\n\nThis is not financial advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Royal Bank of Canada\n2. At the Money Offering\n3. 10K and Proxy Material\n4. Share Recall\n5. AMAs and Celebrities\n6. Bank Closures and Lights on, No Date, Shills are Downvoting me!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Royal Bank of Canada**\n\nThis was one of the worst an craziest series of misinformation that just flew around this sub.  Starting on Friday posts flew around the sub about RBC's price tanking.  This [post flew to the top and was on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msu486/shitadel_buys_rbc_stock_and_afterhours_drop_60/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on Saturday.  It has 5,300 upvotes and 1,300 comments with the top comment (aside from the Mod's) with 3,200 upvotes.  It's the first post that comes up if you search RBC and the first post to come to the top if you search Royal Bank of Canada is this post which claims it's legit because the prices matched on [Google and NASDAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msqfrd/looks_like_the_royal_bank_of_canada_is_one_of_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nIt wasn't until a day later that c[ounter DD was posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mt8syk/attention_rbc_citadel_misinformation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  It's great DD but the insistence on tying things to Citadel is a bit over the top. Buuut it looked at all of the possibilities of what could have happened: filings, offerings, low volume, and even included the counter DD in its edits.\n\nThe majorly disappointing thing about this whole FUD ordeal is that on Monday when everything went back to normal as predicted, it wasn't addressed by Mods or the 'big names' who have a platform.  [Even this post that had a tweet directly from RBC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtiq7b/finally_got_a_reply_from_rbc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) saying it wasn't an issue barely got 100 votes.\n\n**SOME TAKEAWAYS AND TIPS:**\n\n* **The RBC situation was nothing more than misinformation.** \n* [*Look at ALL the filings and understand what they do*](https://www.intelligize.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/intelligize_sec_forms_guide.pdf)*.  424B2s are filed often and regularly as updates to the prospectus.* [*You can use EDGAR*](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) *to to search for filings and* [*this list to help understand what the filings are*](https://help.edgar-online.com/edgar/formtypes.asp)*.*\n* *Look at the volume of trades, if it's low, like 900 shares or a low value it's probably not a huge player. You can often find the volume on your trading app or head to the* [*NASDAQ website to look*](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme)*.*\n* *Don't immediately assume everything is because of Shitadel (although there are ties most places... it's often not them directly doing something).*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. At the Money Offering**\n\nThis FUD is similar to the last one as it's important to know what filings are and how they work.  This one was a combination of mostly shitty reporting and our own oversharing and flooding with posts.\n\nI don't know why but for some reason all of these media outlets always publish the same BS article on shelf offerings.  As much as I wish it was evidence of shittiness from the media being bought by hedgies it's most likely not.  Although, it is entirely possible as one of the examples of BS reporting on offerings was on SPCE or Virgin Galactic which also had surprisingly high short interest.\n\nBack to the point, there was aggressive FUD when the news came out because people didn't understand what the offering was before posting about it.  Or simply posted a screenshot or a link to an article without any helpful information for the smooothed brains among us.  This one was fortunately picked up quickly by the big daily from [Rensole](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ml7lp0/synopsis_for_04062021_what_we_need_to_know_before/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nThere were tons of duplicate posts flying around about what an offering is, how much money they will bring in, when they'll use the offering, what this means for the squeeze.  Most of these were low quality posts, links, or questions that didn't offer much  more than misinformation.\n\n**SOME TAKEAWAYS AND TIPS:**\n\n* **The ATM is a shelf-offering that doesn't have to be used.**\n* *This is pretty similar to the last point.  Check out the filings of the company before posting and understand what they do.*\n* *You can go* [*directly to the GME website*](https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/sec-filings) *and see their filings or use EDGAR.  You can also sign up for notifications.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. 10-K and 14-A Filings, Hidden Messages and Memes, Legal Disclaimers**\n\nOk, this is a big one.  Ryan Cohen is not trying to send us secret messages encoded in the filings or in Tweets.  That would be an insane risk to himself, GME and everyone involved in this GME situation.  That's literally the definition of market manipulation and fraud even if it's just a Tweet, [Elon Musk was charged with securities fraud for a Tweet](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-219). There were tons of posts about 04/15 and 04/20 that ended up confusing the issues of share recall and priming everyone for FUD.  THESE WERE NOT POSTED BY SHILLS.  THESE WERE EVEN POSTED BY MODS.\n\nPeople got very excited about the new wording in the 10-K about the inclusion of short squeeze and other price related legal wording in their *RISK FACTORS* section.  This wasn't a secret message or a nod to apes, it was a legal requirement.\n\nThis is also the case with the 14-A filing recently where several posts have highlighted the urgency to vote being different from last year.  There was a misconception that was picked up quickly and spread that [we need to vote ASAP because this is what will cause the squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwybt4/voting_is_the_catalyst_rc_cannot_prove_there_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  There's no urgency to rush and vote.  Here are all of the 14A filings with the same boilerplate notice (except last year with the Hestia stuff that had extra info).\n\n[In the 2020 Proxy Statement on Page 9 it says](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-120938/):\n\n&gt;**Your vote is especially important this year in light of Hestia and Permit\u2019s proxy contest. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we urge you to vote as soon as possible using the enclosed BLUE proxy card. Please see \u201cHow do I vote?\u201d below for more information on how to vote.**and again on page 61:**STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO SUBMIT THEIR BLUE PROXY CARDS WITHOUT DELAY. A PROMPT RESPONSE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED**\n\n[In the 2019 Proxy Statement on Page 58 it says](https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-19-000087/):\n\n&gt;**STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO FORWARD THEIR PROXIES WITHOUT DELAY. A PROMPT RESPONSE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.**\n\n[In the 2018 Proxy Statement on Page 51 it says](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/327eb10f-7d51-4110-8a60-24b942c5699b):\n\n&gt;**STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO FORWARD THEIR PROXIES WITHOUT DELAY. A PROMPT RESPONSE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.**\n\nYes, you should vote as soon as you can but there is over a month of time during which you can vote.  **The entirety of the materials aren't set to be released** [**until the 28th according to their website**](https://www.proxydocs.com/branding/962080/edocs/2021/issuer/). This has led to a wild amount of FUD with claims of phishing and hedgies trying to get your control number to vote. **THIS IS NOT TRUE.** [The phishing incident that is making rounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvf20m/heads_up_fidelity_customers_phishing_emails_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) has nothing to do with GME, nowhere in the image does it mention GME, control numbers, or voting and the poster never mentioned it had anything to do with GME. [It's a known phishing attempt using DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/blog/docusign-update-recent-phishing-attack#:~:text=Hover%20over%20all%20embedded%20links,bottom%20of%20every%20DocuSign%20email).\n\nHowever, there are posts like this that are claiming, with absolutely zero evidence, [that someone is out to get your voting rights.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxhcnq/beware_phishing_scams_are_trying_to_steal_your/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  The most disheartening part of that post is the mod comment that this is a shill tactic.  It's not, it's apes running with something and spreading our own FUD.  That post itself is FUD, no evidence, no sources, no links.  [There are tons of these types of posts floating around](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwzwji/when_you_vote_your_shares_make_sure_you_are_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\n**IF YOU ASK FOR PROOF AND GET A RESPONSE LIKE THIS THEN THERE IS NO PROOF. THE INTERNET IS NOT PROOF. THIS IS FROM THE PINNED PHISHING POST.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If you see responses like this to requests for proof, DOWNVOTE!](https://preview.redd.it/unov8wws3hv61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=321e91ae7d743c6af1bf05919f877f382e9a24cd)\n\nThe most important part about this is that you might actually miss out on your voting material because you ignored an email that you thought was a phishing attempt.  [Here is a good guide using MVIS as an example with information on how certain brokers send the materials](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/iip2re/proxy_vote_guide_here_is_why_to_vote_for_and_how/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  It is important to do this research yourself and find out what firm is supply your brokers with proxy information.  [Robinhood uses Mediant](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/shareholder-meetings-and-elections/), others use [Compushare, Broadridge, or D.F. King](https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/information/proxy-voting-faq).\n\nThere is a big difference from providing information to people about the possibility of phishing and the importance of voting but **SCREAMING ABOUT SHILLS STEALING YOUR VOTE ONLY PRODUCES FUD.**\n\nYou need to be patient as there is probably an insane volume of people asking for their proxy materials which was not expected. [Last year only 66% of shares voted](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/349495b7-542f-4501-921c-320746dabbba).\n\n**SOME TAKEAWAYS AND TIPS:**\n\n* **There's no evidence of phishing attempts directed towards the proxy.**\n* **There are no hidden messages in Tweets or filings.** \n* *Look for the source and compare the proper sections.*\n* *When you post DD with* ***long*** *documents include the page number, section, etc.*\n* *If you do not see these things, ask for them.  If they're not provided, DON'T UPVOTE!*\n* *There are tons of Phishing posts from real people who are concerned but downvote posts that spread fear.*\n* *These aren't shill tactics, it's us reposting and upvoting bad info or clickbait titles!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Share Recall**\n\nThis one is the most frustrating of all because directly contradictory information was posted by the biggest daily poster in the sub.  I respect Rensole and understand how difficult it is to put this stuff together [but in his own post he says](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwrt08/synopsis_for_04232021_what_we_need_to_know_before/):\n\n&gt;Think critically about everything, this includes your own opinion, be open to the idea of being wrong with something, this leaves room to learn and change what you believe.\n\n**THIS INCLUDES THE PEOPLE THIS SUB HAS COME TO IDOLIZE AS WELL AS THE MODS**.  The mods are human just like we are and they make mistakes.  The important thing is to not ignore those mistakes because of their status.  This whole debacle started with constant flooding of memes and low quality duplicate posts that were never removed.  As I mentioned before even mods shared some of these.  In some cases it was off Reddit but when you're a mod of a community that is under the microscope it's not great to be spam sharing news and memes without checking the validity of what you're sharing.\n\nBack to the point.  There has still yet to be any evidence or sources provided to support any theories on a mass share recall still happening.\n\nThere have, however, been a slew of posts about how share recalls work:\n\n* [Share Recall, Share Audit, The Misreport in the Morning News](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwsxox/share_recall_share_audit_the_misreport_in_the/)\n* [Clarification on GameStop RECORD DATE - Shares Recalled or Not?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwj1ko/clarification_on_gamestop_record_date_shares/)\n* [Comment on Recall](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mra4xq/superstonk_discussion_april_15_2021/gunvaq9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n* [My own DD on terms, dates of record, and my own theory on the possibility of overvoting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mws33j/voting_rights_date_of_record_failure_to_deliver/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nThe share recall issue has still not been settled and other apes are still posting about the possibility of a share recall, when will the recall be, RECALL=MOASS, and other similar posts.\n\nThese are what create FUD, particularly the RECALL=MOASS type posts as well as the flooding of memes and low-effort posts.  These are not shills doing this, these are our friendly apes getting hyped and being hyped again by important members of this community.\n\n**SOME TAKEAWAYS AND TIPS:**\n\n* **There are different types of recall, a vote recall has passed.**\n* *The mods are human and make mistakes*\n* ***Always look for a source.  If there is not a source it is likely not true.***\n* *Downvote if sources are not included.*\n* *Look at all the filings, learn the terms, research how they work.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. AMAs and Celebrities**\n\nI've touched on this a bit through all of the previous sections but this sub has come to idolize certain individuals.  Everyone is human, everyone makes mistakes, don't dismiss a mistake or misinformation because of someone's status.\n\nPeople have been wildly disappointed by previous AMAs because they've turned the individuals into messiahs or prophets and then are disappointed when these people don't confirm our biases.  They all have their own opinions and most importantly they have to ***legally*** watch what they say.  This is why Cohen isn't communicating secretly through Tweets or Gamestop Deal of The Days. They're under the microscope.  If you think shills are trying to get your proxy vote do you not think they're trying not smart enough to try to call market manipulation on the smallest thing?\n\nWe've also turned people like DFV and Ryan Cohen and certain members of this community into celebrities who can do no wrong.  I've pointed out a few cases above but I do not want to call anyone out specifically by name.  Yes, I realize that they work hard for us and it can be stressful but this issue is on ***us***, not them.  ***We*** need to stop turning people into infallible sources of information and question what they post if it does not have sources, evidence, etc.\n\n**SOME TAKEAWAYS AND TIPS:**\n\n* **Don't expect confirmation bias in AMAs**\n* *Everyone is human and makes mistakes.*\n* ***Always look for a source.  If there is not a source it is likely not true.***\n* *Downvote if sources are not included.*\n* *If something is lacking sources or is bad question it! Regardless of that person's status!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Bank Closures and Lights on, No Date, Shills are Downvoting me!**\n\nThis is mostly an opinion section.\n\n**Banks**\n\nThis is just dumb stuff that causes problems and creates FUD.  The bank closures and pictures of banks with lights on was just insane speculation and honestly a little creepy.  This is the stuff that is the most detrimental to GME and the community because it paints the members as wacky conspiracy theorists.  It's also weird.  Normal people work there and have lives that are probably miserable and don't need some weird dude in a gorilla mask harassing them.  I'm not defending hedgies but damn, let people be.\n\nIt's also not great because this type of stuff makes it into DD and highly upvoted posts as evidence that *something* is going on.  Not everything is directly related to GME and the lights on in a bank over the weekend does not mean that someone's shitty DD is correct.\n\n**No Dates**\n\nThis one is just wacky to me and I am not supporting hedgies, saying they're smarter than us, or saying we're dumb.  But they are on the inside and we are on the outside.  They have people who worked for the DTC, NSCC, FINRA, SEC, etc.  They have people who have been doing this for decades.  Do you not think they know the dates?  They know every date and what's going to happen on that date.  They hold all the cards and we can't see them until the date has passed.\n\nThe problem with dates is that ***we*** massively hype up dates with memes (04/20 for example) and then when that date comes, everyone is sad.  That is FUD and that is done by us shooting ourselves in the foot with hype. People who scream NO DATES THEY'RE USING THEM AGAINST US are creating FUD.  Just stop meming and hyping dates with minimal information.\n\n**Shills are downvoting me!**\n\nNo they aren't.  You can see the ratio of up and down votes.  Just saying \"I'm prepared for this to get downvoted by shills\" is nonsense.  I'm sure there are some shills who are downvoting things but when the majority of posts are 90% upvoted then I suspect that there aren't that many active shills around.\n\n**Suicide Reporting**\n\nAfter my post about share recalls and voting I got a message that someone reported me for being suicidal.  The same goes for one of the other authors of the posts above about share recalls.\n\nWhy would a shill report us for trying to clarify information on share recalls that goes against major theories and current hype?\n\n**SOME TAKEAWAYS AND TIPS:**\n\n* **Flooded meme posts are used as evidence for DD.**\n* *Stop posting weird creepy shit about banks.*\n* *Chill with the No Dates thing, they already know the dates.*\n* *There are likely not as many shills as we think but we conjure them up.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI made this post because there's constant FUD produced by ourselves and then we go running for the hills screaming shill.  We need to be better at writing DD and holding DD writers to a higher standard.  We also need to hold everyone to a higher standard because it's not just DD posts that make it to the top. It's also discussion posts and memes that can push ideas in certain directions.\n\nI also made this post because in recent discussions with friends about GME, they have all told me that it's insane and probably a cult.  They didn't care about the good DD, they only cared about the bad shit that is posted.  If the strategy is to **BUY** and hold then only have the strategy is really working as many people outside this sub won't give a shit because of insane theories.\n\nAll we're doing is giving the actual shills and hedgies ammo to use against us.  It doesn't take much for  hediges to grab something and publish it to discredit the entire community. Soo I'm asking people to please be more diligent with the sub.  Question posts without sources, if there are sources demand page numbers, if there are no sources then downvote! This goes for DD, Discussion, News, etc. Push bad DD back down.\n\nI'm also asking mods to enforce their duplicate post rules more aggressively or just create megathreads.  Just today the mod is chock full of weird ass FUD posts that are low effort and\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Expect more of DD and posts and hold them to a higher standard regardless of who they are.\n* Downvote posts with no sources.\n* Read the filings and learn what things mean!\n* Think about where theories come from.\n* Even good intentioned posts can have misinformation. Call it out!\n* **BUY AND HOLD (I don't know how to do emojis so imagine some rocket ships here).**\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust to add in an even more recent example of exactly what I\u2019m pointing out in this post. The [new Daily Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/myuecm/superstonk_daily_04262021/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) just included an entire section on the idea that GME is urging people to vote this year. THIS IS FALSE. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s false information getting picked up and spread around. \n\nThe wording is exactly the same as the last few years regarding urging shareholders to vote as soon as possible. I\u2019ve provided the links and page numbers in this post!",
