<p><strong>TLDR; Market Makers are the ones adopting the debt day after day. Daily volume proves they are only taking on more and more debt each day and the only exit for them is margin call.</strong></p>
<h1>PREFACE</h1>
<p>I've been wanting to write a small(ish) DD on market volume for a while now. I believe it is one of the most significant and clear indications of what's happening with GME behind the scenes, but is often only given passive consideration or attention or is often not well understood. When we have days or weeks where the price seems to be in a tail spin, I feel the need to remind people of just how certain our data is, and how there truly is only one possible outcome. Not financial advice tho.</p>
<p>I am going to break down how market volume is reported daily, how short volume factors in, and finally what actionable information can be extracted from these two daily metrics, and how the reported data can only mean one thing: The Hedgies are screwed.</p>
<h1>EXCHANGE REPORTED VOLUME</h1>
<p>Each exchange records it's number of trades, referred to as volume, in real time and in a finalized (corrected) daily report. The total sums of those volumes from each exchange is what makes up the reported daily volume you see on your stock app or on Yahoo Finance.</p>
<p>There are three types of volume; Total Volume, Short Volume, and Short Exempt Volume. Short Exempt Volume is a short trade that is exempt for restrictions on short trades. On days when a stock is short sale restricted you can only short at a price higher than the last trade or when the stock price is climbing. Market Makers can mark shorts as exempt and trade then lower. For our purposes, short exempt volume is just a second type of short volume.</p>
<h1>SHORT VOLUME</h1>
<p>Most people on this board think of short volume as a measure of how much shorting traders are doing, but that is fundamentally incorrect. In the dark ages long ago, in January and before, we apes were just forming our first wrinkles and used short volume to guess at SI, noticing that each day short volume was over 50% of the stocks total volume. We were primates discovering fire and noticing we could use it to make farts explode but not really unlocking it's full potential.</p>
<p>Nearly all trading done on the market today goes through market makers. Our financial system has been built so that overlords (known as market makers), with special access to the exchanges stand between everyone trading and fills the orders. When you put an order in with your broker, say Fidelity, (who then may or may not pass the order to their clearing firm if they aren't self-clearing), that order is then sent to a market maker. The market maker then fills the order from their own pocket. If you want to buy, they sell you their share, if you want to sell, they'll buy your share. You aren't actually trading directly with another retail investor, you're trading with a market maker.</p>
<p>There are many market makers and they compete to fill the orders from brokers. Market Makers take their revenue from buying high and selling low the shares sold to them and bought from them. Ideally, when you sell a share, and someone wants to buy a share the market maker sees the two orders, buys the share at $100, then sells the share to the other person for $100.01. They use large volumes of trades to skim off cents or fractions of cents on each share traded. To justify their existence, they provide the service of fast trades, accurate price quotes, and competition between market makers keeps them from over charging. That's how it works on paper at least.</p>
<p>A short is effectively a debt. A promise to buy, an IOU. That's what's reported in short volume, how many trades were people buying IOUs. When you buy a 1 share, you buy from a market maker and they give you a synthetic share, an IOU. They are in debt 1 share. <strong>Nearly all buys are short volume according to the exchange</strong>, as the market maker is selling the retail trader one pretend share and promising to hand them a real share later. We'll dive down that rabbit hole a bit more later.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short_is_long.pdf?">Read more about buys equating to shorts in this whitepaper</a>)</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm">RegSho</a>: The market maker is supposed to buy the share (and clear their debt) within seconds, but they have up to six days (T+6) to actually buy that share before they lose their ability to short more. They have up to three days (T+3) to settle the trade, which involves processing the funds through the broker or clearing firm. When the money enters the Market Maker's bank account, they have to deliver the share they owe to the broker before the end of the trading day or it will be declared as a Failure To Deliver (FTD). FTDs have to be resolved (a share delivered) within the next 3 days (3 days to settle, 3 days in FTD gives a total of six days for T+6).</p>
<p>To slightly go off topic for a moment, it is at this point, during the second half of the T+6 period that an FTD is reported and a short share (a debt) can be delayed by 35 calendar days from the settlement (the first half of T+6) before they have to deliver the share they owe.</p>
<p>To break this down a little more: when you buy a share, your money is promised to the market maker but an actual buy does not yet hit the exchange. You get your share (apparently) but your money sits in a safety box until the trade is settled. The market maker then has 3 days to actually go out and fill that buy order on the exchange. They then buy the share at the time that will maximize their profits, if they ever buy a share at all. Therefore, when we buy a share, they get stuck with debt, but regardless if we buy or sell our shares, the market makers make money. That's the reason why trade volume decreasing is such a good sign, it means their ability to make cash and stay solvent is decreasing.</p>

<h1>HOW WE CAN USE SHORT VOLUME AND TOTAL VOLUME</h1>
<p>Based on the information above, a normal healthy stock should be trading at around 50% short volume. 51% short volume represents more buy pressure, while 49% short volume represents more sell pressure. Buy/sell pressure though doesn't necessarily affect price, as market makers can hold off on fulfilling the other end of the trade up to 6 trading days, or even 35 calendar days plus 3 trading days. On top of that they can fill orders in dark pool, where the trade wont affect price, or borrow shares, fulfilling their short with a new short and not changing the price.</p>
<p>All along that gumdrop trail are also opportunities for bad accounting and bad practices to accidentally mark short trades as long or loan out a share multiple times. A tiny trickle of extra shares getting born every day, by accident and intentional deception, diluting the value of a stock.</p>
<p>Then what value, if any, does short volume offer us? Well, it gives us one fantastic datapoint, it tells us approximate buy volume. Either a trader wanted to buy a share, or a trader wanted to borrow a share (which they have to still buy sooner or later). The fact that day after day after day, we see short volume above 60% means we are in a position where buying is always high and never stops. There is not a chance for the hedge funds to escape their over leveraged positions and are demonstrably either diggings themselves deeper or at best kicking the can down the road, there is no escape for them.</p>
<p>We can't use this information to calculate SI%, or understand what the price is going to do, because the market makers have too many tools at their disposal to obfuscate their movements and manipulate the price. If anyone had any doubt though, the Short Volume shows that there is only one exit to this ride. Buckle Up.</p>
<p>FOOTNOTE</p>
<p>I track GME volume daily, data taken from each exchange. However, I can't access daily volume data from MIAX, NASDAQ, LTSE, IEX, or MEMX, which in total account for approximately 20% of the daily total volume. If you have access to daily short volume data from any of those exchanges, please DM me.</p>
