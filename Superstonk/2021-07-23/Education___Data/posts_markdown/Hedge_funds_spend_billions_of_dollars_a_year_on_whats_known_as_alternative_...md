# Title: Hedge funds spend billions of dollars a year on what's known as 'alternative data.' I've been collecting and publicizing some of this data over the past couple years, and want to start posting daily data updates on here if there's interest. Here's an example of it would look like.

I've been building [Quiver Quantitative](https://www.quiverquant.com/) over the past couple years, a free alternative data platform, and wanted to start sharing some of the data I've been providing in the form of daily posts.

If you'd like to take a deeper dive, you can clink the links in the section headings to see live data updates for the respective datasets, or navigate through the rest of [my investment data site](https://www.quiverquant.com/) to see other datasets.

These updates include just a handful of brief insights from a few of my datasets to keep things as simple as possible. I know people get tired of reading big walls of text, so I'll try to keep these updates as visual as possible.

I hope you enjoy, and please let me know if you have any feedback.
