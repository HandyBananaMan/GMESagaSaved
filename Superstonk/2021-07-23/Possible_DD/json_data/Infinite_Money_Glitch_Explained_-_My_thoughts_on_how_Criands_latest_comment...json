    "selftext": "This is the infinite money glitch as I see it, explained for \ud83e\udda7retard apes like me.\n\n[Thanks to Criand's explanation of how SFTs facilitate the reseting of FTDs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opuziu/visual_of_the_sft_trades_to_prevent_shorts_andor/)\n\nThe basic premise is that mommy and daddy both balance their books, but mommy and daddy don't talk to one another, so you can scam the system by kicking the can between them.  If you can reset an FTD  (failure to deliver), you can make infinite money from nothing.\n\n\ud83d\udc69Mommy = Market Makers\n\n\ud83d\udc74Daddy = DTCC (Clearing house)\n\n\ud83d\ude08Child = Hedgefunds (aka dirty fucking assholes)\n\n\ud83c\udf4cGME Shares\n\nWhen \ud83d\ude08SHFs sell a \ud83c\udf4cshare they don't have, \ud83d\udc74daddy basically gives them a month to locate it or else they label it a FTD and it becomes belt whooping time.\n\n>*Child, ya can't sell a promise. Go make good on that promise or I'll bend you over and beat ya raw*\n\nWell, the \ud83d\ude08 did sell that promise. Sold it for \ud83d\udcb2. And for a whole month, the \ud83d\ude08 SHF is walking around with pockets full of \ud83d\udcb2 all for doing nothing! But the month is coming to a close, and \ud83d\udc74daddy is begining to reach for the belt.\n\nWell \ud83d\ude08 has never had any \ud83c\udf4cto sell and can't find any, so he goes to \ud83d\udc69 mommy.\n\n>*What's that? You spent your allowance already? You need some \ud83c\udf4cto go buy ice cream? You promise you'll pay it back? Oh, don't worry honey, mommy loves you.*\n\n\ud83d\udc69Mommy 'poofs' an imaginary \ud83c\udf4cshare into existance and gives it to the \ud83d\ude08 SHF. That's what mommy is for, to smooth things out between allowances. But don't be fooled, mommy isn't a pushover, it's not a gift and she wants that \ud83c\udf4cshare back soon. She's raising a responsible little child and won't let them run a debt.\n\nWell the \ud83d\ude08 SHF takes that \ud83c\udf4cand gives it to \ud83d\udc74daddy. Daddy checks it off. It took a month but their child sold a \ud83c\udf4c and they delivered a \ud83c\udf4c. \ud83d\udc74is proud of their honest child. But here's the thing - \ud83d\udc74Daddy DTCC can't tell the difference between a real \ud83c\udf4c and an imaginary fake one that \ud83d\udc69Mommy Market Maker created. ***They look the same to him.***\n\nWell now all \ud83d\ude08has to do is make mommy happy. He goes into a dark spot on the playground and buys a \ud83c\udf4cfrom another \ud83d\ude08 friend of theirs using his \ud83d\udcb2 from his sold \ud83c\udf4c. It isn't a *real* \ud83c\udf4c they are buying (their friend is running a scam too) but the fake share will fool mommy.\n\nAnd so \ud83d\ude08 takes that \ud83c\udf4cand gives it back to \ud83d\udc69Mommy. Mommy is so proud of their child. She 'poofs' that \ud83c\udf4cout of existance, and zeros out the loan. But here's the thing. That banana was *sold* but hasn't cleared the other \ud83d\ude08's Daddy yet. Mommy can't tell the difference between a real \ud83c\udf4cand one that hasn't been located and settled with \ud83d\udc74Daddy DTCC yet. ***They look the same to her.***\n\nMommy and Daddy don't talk to each other.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nWait you say, but the \ud83d\ude08 didn't make any money! He kicked the can back and forth between the DTCC and a Market Maker (like Citadel), but what's the point?? He sold a \ud83c\udf4cfor \ud83d\udcb2 ... but a month later he just spent a \ud83d\udcb2 for a \ud83c\udf4cso nothing changed in the end!!\n\nWell, for **29 days** \ud83d\ude08had a pocket full of \ud83d\udcb2. And for **one day** his pocket was empty. If they naked short sold 1x\ud83c\udf4c each day, then every single day of the month, their pocket would have 29x\ud83d\udcb2 in it. Their pocket would ALWAYS be full.\n\nMaybe they take 1x\ud83d\udcb2 out of their pocket to buy a \ud83d\udea2 yaht with. No big deal. Each day they only need a single \ud83d\udcb2 to reset that day's scam, and after reseting the just naked shot again and get the single \ud83d\udcb2back! And they still have \ud83d\udcb2x28 left! Let's buy some \ud83d\udea2\ud83d\udea2\ud83d\udea2s!\n\nAnd you know what, this works so well, I think I'm going to start naked short selling 2x\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c every day now. **Infinite money glitch**. All because \ud83d\udc69Mommy Market Maker and \ud83d\udc74Daddy DTCC can't recognize each other's fake temporary asset from a real one.\n\nThat's the beauty of this. The DTCC has a system to prevent naked short selling, and Market Makers also have a system, BUT ONLY IN ISOLATION. If you can kick it back and forth between them, because you have a month before FTD, you can pocket the spread *in time*.",
