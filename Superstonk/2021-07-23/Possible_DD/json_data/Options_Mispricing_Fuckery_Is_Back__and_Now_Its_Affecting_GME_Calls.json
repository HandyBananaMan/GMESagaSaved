    "selftext": "A couple of months ago, I posted a series on some very strange shenanigans I was seeing in the options \"carry value\" prices -- basically, way OTM options were being valued in an account as massively inflated prices.\n\nYou can check out some posts about it here (they contain links to some of the other posts):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfczb2/even\\_more\\_cheat\\_codes\\_so\\_much\\_options\\_fuckery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfczb2/even_more_cheat_codes_so_much_options_fuckery/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbjckf/stress\\_tests\\_are\\_easy\\_with\\_cheat\\_codes\\_may\\_13/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbjckf/stress_tests_are_easy_with_cheat_codes_may_13/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**The TL;DR** \\-- I had options (in particular, $BKNG puts) that were effectively worthless, but were being carried at massively inflated prices. It was making it possible to purchase a put for less than a couple of dollars and then have that Put multiply its value in an account by 20X, 30X, even as much up to 40X the actual value (even though there was no market for the put ... no buyer at the inflated price). \n\nWell, now I'm seeing the same thing affect one of my $GME calls today.\n\nTake a look at this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ism6w7du3zc71.png?width=2064&format=png&auto=webp&s=4050e579bd50e52bb43430df0cce854a096dcbe4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65d5ukuu3zc71.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf3421292dd173278cc0e02d68b9b2f175b2e40\n\nI think we can all agree $GME isn't going over $680 today, so this Call is not only effectively worthless, it's technically worth only $.50, not $50.\n\nFor deep OTM Puts/Calls, the formula for the carry value should be the mid-point between the bid and the ask, X 100 (since 1 option contract covers 100 shares). So since the bid is zero and the ask is $.01 X 100 ($1.00), the carry value should be $.50. There is 9,121 OI at this strike price, which means $456,050 in FLASE value is potentially being added to account because of this single option. I wonder if any of this false value is helping anyone avoid a margin call today.\n\nThis is the first time I've seen this issue affect Calls (and $GME to boot). Is anyone else seeing anything similar in any of their calls expiring today (or on any other day for that matter)? Remember, the value of the option in the portfolio should be the midpoint between bid/ask X 100.\n\nEdit #1: Grammar and clarity.",
