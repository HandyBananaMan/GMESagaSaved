<p>Today, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P500 hit ATH, and as of 3:00PM, the Dow Jones came within a few bucks. However, this is due to the mega-caps doing the heavy lifting while most other tickers bleed. The concensus in the market seems to be that the FED is pumping these companies with trillions of dollars.</p>

<p>If the US debt ceiling isn't raised or suspended by Aug1, the US is projected to default on its debt Aug2; as per Yellen in a letter to Congress. If this happens, I imagine the stock market would go berserk. Negative beta means GME moons. (no dates, if anything, I expect USGov to raise the debt ceiling late next week)</p>

<p>The NSCC-2021-010 rule is meant to allow the "pawning" of securities for cash in the event of a margin call. It's a simple rule. I like it.</p>

<p>Putting these 3 items together, I believe the FED may be pumping mega-caps for the sole purpose of providing SHF the liquidity necessary to try and buy retail out.</p>
