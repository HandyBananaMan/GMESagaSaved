NSCC-2021-803 & NSCC-2021-010 new clearing service. Addresses Over night SFT'S, Failed to deliver, Synthetic shares and much more

The end is nearer then ever Boy's & Girls, 

the SCC is going to put new rules in place soon blocking all the holes and backdoors the Heggies are using. 

Over the past 3 months or more the SCC has put in place dozen of new rules and everyone is always whining ,,but no on enforces the rules. Turns out the couldn't enforce the rules for a very simple reason, (ready?).

BECAUSE THE RULES DIDN'T EXIST,

What?

That's right, the rules to hold these AssHats accountable didn't exist. That's until now. This big one coming up (about 365 page's) ties all there other new rulings together and when they set an effective date on these last rulings it's all over for these scum bags. Everything will be public, back doors are closed 

Think of it as the final touches to a public lynching platform, the criminal is on display, arms tied behind back, noose aroundnd neck,, all that's missing is the trip lever to sping the trap door.

NSCC-2021-803 & NSCC-2021-010 rulings are in effect the missing trip lever. 

Bye, bye Kenny
