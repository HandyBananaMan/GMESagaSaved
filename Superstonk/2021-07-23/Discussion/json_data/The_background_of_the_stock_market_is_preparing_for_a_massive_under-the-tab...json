    "selftext": "1. Today, the Nasdaq and the S&P500 hit ATH, and as of 3:00PM, the Dow Jones came within a few bucks. However, this is due to the mega-caps doing the heavy lifting while most other tickers bleed. The concensus in the market seems to be that the FED is pumping these companies with trillions of dollars.\n\n2. If the US debt ceiling isn't raised or suspended by Aug1, the US is projected to default on its debt Aug2; as per Yellen in a letter to Congress. If this happens, I imagine the stock market would go berserk. Negative beta means GME moons. (no dates, if anything, I expect USGov to raise the debt ceiling late next week)\n\n3. The NSCC-2021-010 rule is meant to allow the \"pawning\" of securities for cash in the event of a margin call. It's a simple rule. I like it.\n\nPutting these 3 items together, I believe the FED may be pumping mega-caps for the sole purpose of providing SHF the liquidity necessary to try and buy retail out.",
