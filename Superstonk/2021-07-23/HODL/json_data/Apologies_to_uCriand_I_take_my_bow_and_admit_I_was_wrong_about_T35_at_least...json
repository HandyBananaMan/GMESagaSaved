    "selftext": "Apologies for calling out /u/criand. I admit I was wrong. T+35 only applies to \"*deemed to own*\" as specified here:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)\n\n>Rule 204 provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver. Specifically, if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is **deemed to own** and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed, the firm has up to 35 calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. Such additional time is warranted and does not undermine the goal of reducing failures to deliver because these are sales of owned securities that cannot be delivered by the settlement date due solely to processing delays outside the seller\u2019s or broker-dealer\u2019s control. Moreover, delivery is required to be made on such sales as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed and situations where a person is deemed to own a security are limited to those specified in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO. A common example of a deemed to own security that cannot be delivered by the settlement date is a security subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nI *incorrectly* applied T+35 here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/op6rji/macd\\_cross\\_and\\_450k\\_ftds\\_due\\_thursday\\_these\\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/op6rji/macd_cross_and_450k_ftds_due_thursday_these_are/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However** with the final RegSHO 204 theory intact and if regulations are worth any of their salt, I nod at **HODL'ING SHARES**, and wait it out. And DONT PULL A WARDEN (yolo weekly options = death, DO NOT DO IT).\n\nThe main RegSHO theory/posts can be found here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oao9oo/the\\_nyse\\_threshold\\_list\\_collapsing\\_shorts\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oao9oo/the_nyse_threshold_list_collapsing_shorts_and/)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/kUf3LGD.png](https://i.imgur.com/kUf3LGD.png)\n\nThis all relies on 7/16 hide the FTDs fuckery with OTM PUT expiration's. So lets see if that part of theory holds true.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm\\_puts\\_are\\_the\\_passed\\_puck\\_of\\_short\\_positions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm_puts_are_the_passed_puck_of_short_positions/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opuziu/visual\\_of\\_the\\_sft\\_trades\\_to\\_prevent\\_shorts\\_andor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opuziu/visual_of_the_sft_trades_to_prevent_shorts_andor/)\n\nLets see if it plays out next month. I now suspect sideways trading for next two weeks (sell puts to steal premium from HFs if you can afford 100 shares).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: the test of 7/16's OTM PUT theory will come on T+5 (end of day 7-26)**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm\\_puts\\_are\\_the\\_passed\\_puck\\_of\\_short\\_positions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/on9dtz/otm_puts_are_the_passed_puck_of_short_positions/)\n\nThe Theory runs on the idea that millions of FTDs were hidden in OTM puts that expired 7/16, with settlement on 7/20 and corresponding T+5 threshold activation on 7-26 EOD. Check NYSE's website on 7-27 for confirmation of this or not. If it is, then GME is back on threshold baby! And we'll know with some greater bias that the number of FTDs will be in the 100 million range before it's released by the SEC.\n\nPart of the reason why this is a good test is because the volume was so low this past week, there' no way they they could have covered 10 million FTDs let alone 100 million. Also banks no longer allowing the PUT BS to continue unabated as it exposes banks.\n\nIf they manage to kick the can again, then just keep selling far (**edit**) ~~OTM covered calls and steal HF premium.~~ \\[selling\\] puts if you can afford the 100 share limit strike price. **Perhaps just don't mess with options,** *RC tweeted recently a picture of a toilet, so far the last 3/3 times, toilet humor has lead to a decline in price. But that's another thread of discussion.*\n\nA massive Monday dip if RC\u2019s toilet thing correlates would make sense in light of Threshold, as Monday would be the make it or break it day for HFs to keep GME off threshold if they can cover the FTDs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit2: Should have included links to threshold list: thanks** u/GreatGrapeApes\n\n>Presence on list from previous days, comes out daily: [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)  \n>  \n>Counts released in batches, much later (15 days or more delay): [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit3: DTC-2021-010 may prevent RegSHO, and** ***LEGALIZE*** **naked short selling through SFTs.**\n\nThis would prevent GME from hitting Threshold list ever again.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opuziu/visual\\_of\\_the\\_sft\\_trades\\_to\\_prevent\\_shorts\\_andor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opuziu/visual_of_the_sft_trades_to_prevent_shorts_andor/)\n\nMy read on this is that this SFT thing works very much like any other credit swap - think CDS of the housing crisis, arhegos margin call, RRP agreements. Allowing Funds the ability to cover naked shorts with credit swaps.\n\nOMG, what have you done kenny boi? Forget black swan events, allowing credit swaps on naked shorts, this has now become a **blackhole event**. It'll take longer to playout, but if they weren't holding market hostage before, they are making it blatantly clear they are holding market hostage now.",
