Happy Friday 7/23! This surprising article below is noteworthy confirmation bias from a financial media source that we more often see discredting GME. I've copied a few relevant passages below. It's not anything Earth shattering in terms of DD but basically confirms our core thesis about GME is correct & gives respect to the strength of apes' Diamond Hands. It's a good, easily digestible article to show a family member or friend who's somewhat of a skeptic and doesn't want to absorb complex Vitamin DD!

Volatile GameStop Stock Will Continue to Burn Shorts

Investor Place·7/23/2021, 4:00:48 AM

Looking back upon a bizarre first half of 2021, it’s interesting to revisit the wild price moves of GME stock.

Everyone and his uncle wants to find the next GameStop, but there’s really nothing like the original. I mean, the price move in this stock was legendary.

And, it set up a target for the bulls. When GME stock touched $483 in January, investors’ accounts lit up bright green while short sellers awaited calls from their brokers’ margin desks.

It was the best of times and the worst of times, depending on which side of the trade you happened to be.

The short sellers have attempted to fight back, but the GameStop stalwarts seem to have endless energy.
For an immediate-term target, the bulls can look back to the GME stock price spikes in March and June. Those times, $300 provided a hard resistance point.

Breaking through that with heavy, sustained volume would set $500 as the level to watch. The bulls almost got there in January — and after all, resistance levels are meant to be taken out.

The folks on Reddit and other social media outlets who like to trade and talk stocks sometimes aren’t taken seriously by the financial press.

That’s a shame, and it’s unfair. Big-money short sellers have pushed stocks in their desired direction for years, so why can’t retail traders band together and take on the institutional “whales”?

It’s a fascinating debate that involves a David-versus-Goliath battle which continues to this day. 

Surprisingly, the retail crowd has kept their attention on GameStop.

For not tossing GME stock out like yesterday’s trash, I’ll give the meme-sters respect.

Furthermore, they haven’t capitulated in the ongoing battle against the short sellers, who undoubtedly control billions of dollars in cash and assets.

If you’d like to join the grassroots resistance movement against the short sellers, then you’ll want to consider your strategy carefully.

Small position sizing is rule number one, always. Yet, there’s another guideline to consider.

Anything above 15% short interest (as measured by short volume ratio) is a good rule of thumb for considering a short squeeze target, in my opinion.

As of July 21, GME stock’s short volume ratio was 24.3%, so this could be a springboard for an epic squeeze. With that, the $300 target and even the $500 level could be taken out quickly.

The Bottom Line on GME Stock

We can view this as a battle of the haves versus the have-nots, or simply as a potentially profitable trading opportunity.

Either way, there could be another major price move coming in GME stock.

And at the end of the day, there’s no point in judging the meme stock traders. Instead, you might consider joining them and possibly booking some nice profits.
