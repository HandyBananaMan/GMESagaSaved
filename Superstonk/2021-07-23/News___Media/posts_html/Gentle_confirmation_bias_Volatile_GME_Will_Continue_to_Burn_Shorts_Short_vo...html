<p>Happy Friday 7/23! This surprising article below is noteworthy confirmation bias from a financial media source that we more often see discredting GME. I've copied a few relevant passages below. It's not anything Earth shattering in terms of DD but basically confirms our core thesis about GME is correct &amp; gives respect to the strength of apes' Diamond Hands. It's a good, easily digestible article to show a family member or friend who's somewhat of a skeptic and doesn't want to absorb complex Vitamin DD!</p>
<p>Volatile GameStop Stock Will Continue to Burn Shorts</p>
<p>Investor Place·7/23/2021, 4:00:48 AM</p>
<p>Looking back upon a bizarre first half of 2021, it’s interesting to revisit the wild price moves of GME stock.</p>
<p>Everyone and his uncle wants to find the next GameStop, but there’s really nothing like the original. I mean, the price move in this stock was legendary.</p>
<p>And, it set up a target for the bulls. When GME stock touched $483 in January, investors’ accounts lit up bright green while short sellers awaited calls from their brokers’ margin desks.</p>
<p>It was the best of times and the worst of times, depending on which side of the trade you happened to be.</p>
<p>The short sellers have attempted to fight back, but the GameStop stalwarts seem to have endless energy.
For an immediate-term target, the bulls can look back to the GME stock price spikes in March and June. Those times, $300 provided a hard resistance point.</p>
<p>Breaking through that with heavy, sustained volume would set $500 as the level to watch. The bulls almost got there in January — and after all, resistance levels are meant to be taken out.</p>
<p>The folks on Reddit and other social media outlets who like to trade and talk stocks sometimes aren’t taken seriously by the financial press.</p>
<p>That’s a shame, and it’s unfair. Big-money short sellers have pushed stocks in their desired direction for years, so why can’t retail traders band together and take on the institutional “whales”?</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating debate that involves a David-versus-Goliath battle which continues to this day. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, the retail crowd has kept their attention on GameStop.</p>
<p>For not tossing GME stock out like yesterday’s trash, I’ll give the meme-sters respect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they haven’t capitulated in the ongoing battle against the short sellers, who undoubtedly control billions of dollars in cash and assets.</p>
<p>If you’d like to join the grassroots resistance movement against the short sellers, then you’ll want to consider your strategy carefully.</p>
<p>Small position sizing is rule number one, always. Yet, there’s another guideline to consider.</p>
<p>Anything above 15% short interest (as measured by short volume ratio) is a good rule of thumb for considering a short squeeze target, in my opinion.</p>
<p>As of July 21, GME stock’s short volume ratio was 24.3%, so this could be a springboard for an epic squeeze. With that, the $300 target and even the $500 level could be taken out quickly.</p>
<p>The Bottom Line on GME Stock</p>
<p>We can view this as a battle of the haves versus the have-nots, or simply as a potentially profitable trading opportunity.</p>
<p>Either way, there could be another major price move coming in GME stock.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, there’s no point in judging the meme stock traders. Instead, you might consider joining them and possibly booking some nice profits.</p>
