<p>Good Morning Apes,</p>
<p>I'd suggest you go get a second cup of coffee because this is going to be a long one, actually get 3 as it feels like it's been 3 days.</p>
<p>Sorry about the post being late it wasn't showing up but Leaglese fixed it</p>

<p>The mods have put up a community poll on whether the ban of the aforementioned term (Can't say the term or the post will be deleted lol) should be revoked or stay banned, the poll will continue for 2 more days so go and exercise your right to vote and partake in the discussion in the comments.</p>
<p>Note jsmar18's post's title and link (just in case) was altered to avoid Automod (sorry mods)</p>

<p>The DTCC has come out with new rule filings and it's 2 big 346-page and 369-page respectively, it will take a while until we understand what it all means but we know some of it is about FTD's. The DTCC states both as "Establish the Securities Financing Transaction Clearing Service and Make Other Changes" I'd recommend reading the comments as Criand goes a little into it.</p>
<h1>They have also released another rule filling <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-014.pdf">DTC-2021-014</a> with  63 pages</h1>
<p>"Provide Settlement Services for Transactions Entered Into Under the Proposed Securities Financing Transaction Clearing Service of the National Securities Clearing Corporation"</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that in all 3 of these rule filings the contact information and signatures have been hidden.</p>

<p>Criand also made a visual, I'd go into that comment section too as the discussion continues there as well.</p>

<p>I don't know if you saw it but it says right there that 46,155,480 (M) shares were traded OTC (off-exchange) that's about half of all GME shares and more than the free float of about 30M And that's just for may, not to mention who the traders were.</p>

<p>dlauer goes into his consistent use of "glitches" to bad and buggy public market data and his attempts over the years to get regulators and Wallstreet to care and "when I try to explain how things work, I'm only trying to help focus attention on the real problems, and away from issues that, in my opinion, are either not real issues or are red herrings" And we love you for trying to keeping us grounded.</p>

<p>Precocious_Kid Might have found a loophole that would allow fractional shares to be rounded down when interest reporting them, say you buy 1.4 shares they Might be able to report it as 1 share if I understand it correctly. It needs to be looked into further before we take it as a possible truth.</p>

<h1>Direct Registration System</h1>
<p>I have been asked to include/post about DRS (Direct Registration System) now I have looked at it and there seems to be relatively low interest in it due to the fact that if the MOASS starts then it will take days to sell and that it seems like a headache to accomplish, now it is an interesting thing, especially for going long with no intent to sell or to time (like the endless pool) and if you want to look at it yourself you can start <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oix5zk/step_by_step_method_for_direct_registering_shares/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ope7uy/drs_direct_registration_system_why_not_register/">here</a> and here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MommaP123/posts/">https://www.reddit.com/user/MommaP123/posts/</a>.

<p>EXCELLENT!</p>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>As always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p><strong>We help each other, we care for each other.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!</strong></p>
<p>This helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p><strong>We don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!</strong></p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>
<p>Don't try to exploit your fanbase, this would also be excellent!</p>
