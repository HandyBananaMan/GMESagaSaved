    "selftext": "Happy Friday 7/23! This surprising article below is noteworthy confirmation bias from a financial media source that we more often see discredting GME. I've copied a few relevant passages below. It's not anything Earth shattering in terms of DD but basically confirms our core thesis about GME is correct & gives respect to the strength of apes' Diamond Hands. It's a good, easily digestible article to show a family member or friend who's somewhat of a skeptic and doesn't want to absorb complex Vitamin DD!\n\nVolatile GameStop Stock Will Continue to Burn Shorts\n\nInvestor Place\u00b77/23/2021, 4:00:48 AM\n\nLooking back upon a bizarre first half of 2021, it\u2019s interesting to revisit the wild price moves of GME stock.\n\nEveryone and his uncle wants to find the next GameStop, but there\u2019s really nothing like the original. I mean, the price move in this stock was legendary.\n\nAnd, it set up a target for the bulls. When GME stock touched $483 in January, investors\u2019 accounts lit up bright green while short sellers awaited calls from their brokers\u2019 margin desks.\n\nIt was the best of times and the worst of times, depending on which side of the trade you happened to be.\n\nThe short sellers have attempted to fight back, but the GameStop stalwarts seem to have endless energy.\nFor an immediate-term target, the bulls can look back to the GME stock price spikes in March and June. Those times, $300 provided a hard resistance point.\n\nBreaking through that with heavy, sustained volume would set $500 as the level to watch. The bulls almost got there in January \u2014 and after all, resistance levels are meant to be taken out.\n\nThe folks on\u00a0Reddit\u00a0and other social media outlets who like to trade and talk stocks sometimes aren\u2019t taken seriously by the financial press.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame, and it\u2019s unfair. Big-money short sellers have pushed stocks in their desired direction for years, so why can\u2019t retail traders band together and take on the institutional \u201cwhales\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating debate that involves a David-versus-Goliath battle which continues to this day. \n\nSurprisingly, the retail crowd has kept their attention on GameStop.\n\nFor not tossing GME stock out like yesterday\u2019s trash, I\u2019ll give the meme-sters respect.\n\nFurthermore, they haven\u2019t capitulated in the ongoing battle against the short sellers, who undoubtedly control billions of dollars in cash and assets.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to join the grassroots resistance movement against the short sellers, then you\u2019ll want to consider your strategy carefully.\n\nSmall position sizing is rule number one, always. Yet, there\u2019s another guideline to consider.\n\nAnything above 15% short interest (as measured by short volume ratio) is a good rule of thumb for considering a short squeeze target, in my opinion.\n\nAs of July 21, GME stock\u2019s\u00a0short volume ratio\u00a0was 24.3%, so this could be a springboard for an epic squeeze. With that, the $300 target and even the $500 level could be taken out quickly.\n\nThe Bottom Line on GME Stock\n\nWe can view this as a battle of the haves versus the have-nots, or simply as a potentially profitable trading opportunity.\n\nEither way, there could be another major price move coming in GME stock.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, there\u2019s no point in judging the meme stock traders. Instead, you might consider joining them and possibly booking some nice profits.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer.\n\nDavid Moadel has provided content on behalf of Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, Finom Group, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.
