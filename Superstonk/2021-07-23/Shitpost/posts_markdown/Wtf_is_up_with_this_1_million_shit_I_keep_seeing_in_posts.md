I’ve seen several posts over the last few days upvoted and awarded touting $1mil as “what everyone wants” or “selling for”. 

No, no, no, fuckin fuck no. Floor is $30mil, gtfo with this $1 Shillion shit. 

That is all…

Well not quite, have a great weekend apes. Go drink some beers and chill. See you on the battlefield Monday rested(or hungover) and ready for action
