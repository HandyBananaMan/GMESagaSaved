First - This is not advice of any kind. Stranger danger remember that! This is just lots of numbers I've taken pictures of with some letters I've slapped together to make a post on the interwebs. I'm a retail investor and considered dumb money, I just like crayons and stonks.

Fantastico now that's out of the way I've compiled all the volume data for GME since the start of 2021 and broken it down into different categories.

Why do I think it was worth doing this with volume? Well it shows us a lot of things like apes have diamond hands, people panic selling, is this an artificial drop in price and also how many shares are being traded vs how many shares are available now that we know the GME float is around **26,664,355** shares.

These things will have different levels of significance to different people, in a normal stock I wouldn't really care how much volume the stock has if I like the fundamentals of the company and I believe it has potential to grow... I will invest. Gamestop is no longer a *regular investment* whatever that really means anyway, and I want to have a good idea of how many players are playing this crazy game, which is why I have done this.

For Apes who still don't understand volume and are looking at the remote for their TVs (also known as magic paintings) here is quick and simple explanation.

If you're still confused... hey you did your best, keep eating crayons and fighting the good fight and I love you, you beautiful bastard.

Now before we get into the data, I want to quickly cover retail being the whale because I still see a lot of people unaware or doubting the buying power that retail has.

&#x200B;

"But how big is the surge in retail trading? Analysts and executives say it is difficult to peg an exact figure, but here are some numbers to put it in perspective:

\* 25%+: The percentage of overall market trades made by retail investors in July and August 2020, according to Virtu Financial, one of the world’s largest retail market makers. In January 2020 retail was 17.1% of the market. Virtu’s data only goes to November, but retail investors appear to have played an even bigger role in 2021. Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon said on Friday retail can represent up to 32% of total U.S. equity volume."

NOW we are ready to look at January!

https://preview.redd.it/qp0li5eh3kw61.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=91e5b562429a47c3738609b25b89a4c9a62e2533

Quick intro I'm sure you noticed some pretty colours! Thank you for noticing but let me quickly explain them.

Any loss GME made in a day is marked as red or light red 3 if you want to be fancy.

Any gains GME made under 5% in a day are orange (light orange 3)

Any gains GME made over 5% in a day I classed as meme stonk gains and they are of course marked light green 3.

So now I've explained the pretty colours let's get into the numbers. **1.26B Gamestop shares traded in January with an average of 66.4m per day giving us an average of 249.12% of the 26.6m float being traded every day for an entire month.**

Now this is total volume of trades reported by the NYSE, this isn't asbolute it doesn't cover over the counter, ETFs, FTDs, darkpools this is only the trades that have actually been declared. With that said there is no accurate way to tell how many of these shares apes actually bought and more importantly still hold. This includes all declared data so that includes high frequency trading, day traders etc etc etc!

If you want to speculate how many GME shares Apes bought and have continued to hold since Jan I would say it's reasonable to put that mark at 10%. Taking into account the data presented from reuters, total activity in the market was 17.1% for 2020 and **could** be as high as 32% for Jan 2021. That however is total market volume that isn't specific to one stock, some stocks could be dominated by retail and others untouched which makes using these numbers for a specific stock difficult and speculative so I'm going to use a more conservative number than 17.1% and start with 10% leaving us room for actual retail activity to be higher and of course it could also be lower.

10% of 1.26B is 126,209,040 shares which is **473.32%** of the float, if you're like whaaaaat no way retail did that well then let's say 5% that's still 63,104,520 million shares which is 236.66% of the float.

This was one month. Are you starting to understand why they tanked the absolute fuck out of GME back in Jan and turned off the buying. Incase you need a reminder...

Key points I want to just extract from this but still I urge you to listen if you haven't already because GME was about to explode in January before it was illegally stopped.

"We have come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system"

"When the shorts can't deliver the shares, the broker representing the longs **must, MUST** by the rules of the system go into the market and buy the shares at **any** price, pushing the price into the **thousands"**

Pretty interesting first month of the year for 2021.. Next up Feb!

&#x200B;

A lot of red here when FUD was everywhere and apes were told you are bag holders the squeeze is over then all of sudden Wednesday 24th happens and boom we are up 104%. Fucking loved Feb because I averaged down like crazy and became a XXX share holder.

Once again let's use the same theory that apes bought 10% - 5% of all shares traded.

10% of all shares traded in Feb - 82,666,350 or 310.03% of the float.

5% of all shares traded in Feb - 41,333,175 or 155.01% of the float.

Now that is only the data for Feb so you have to total this....

**10% of diamond hands through Jan - Feb**

208,875,390 shares or 783.35% of the float.

**5% of diamond hands through Jan - Feb**

167,542,215 or 391.68% of the float.

ARE YOU STARTING TO SEE WHY THEY KEEP HOPING WE GET BORED AND LEAVE!?!?

Let's take a look at March

https://preview.redd.it/h4iivk0vkrw61.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfbfaea9f46fe4805ffc5a8b381d34f892a5ff00

Now again remember what happened when GME reached $345 per share

Again if you need a quick video break to help explain this to you here is Uncle Bruce covering this

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDJTFvKaP0o&t=335s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDJTFvKaP0o&t=335s)

LIKE BUTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!

*(I just wanted to say that after posting a uncle bruce link)*

Total NYSE volume 677m shares a lot lower than the previous months which one shows that retail bought the dip and now have diamond hands. I've heard some argue that it means that hedgefunds have covered... no.

(Previous DD talking about this in more detail.) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo7t8c/options\_data\_proves\_hedgefunds\_need\_to\_bankrupt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo7t8c/options_data_proves_hedgefunds_need_to_bankrupt/)

Think of it like a video game, the big boss levels haven't changed but when apes were playing in January and the apes started winning at an alarming rate so the market makers tried to patch the game by (illegally) making it harder for apes. Diamond apes took the challenge and now have new challenging levels to take on. The diamond apes are absolutely killing it and will get back to the boss level sooner rather than later ready to set new high scores.

Likely some smaller players have gotten out but new players have entered this crazy game.

(Article with Hedgie Bill Gross bragging about making $10m shorting GME) [https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/how-billionaire-bill-gross-managed-his-insecurities-and-made-10m-shorting-gamestop-20210317](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/how-billionaire-bill-gross-managed-his-insecurities-and-made-10m-shorting-gamestop-20210317)

Key points for lazy apes that don't click links

\-  Wednesday March 17, 2021

\-  “I did manage to overcome my insecurities and hold on and ride it all the way back down in terms of getting out,” billionaire Gross told [*Bloomberg*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6UK8qh_b08) on 16 March.

\- “I’m back in. I’m still selling call options at $250 and $300, the volatility is super high and that promotes an ability to make some money.”

\-  In his latest comments, Gross noted that he made about $10m in profits and said: “The borrowing rate on shorted shares for GameStop is only 1.5% which indicates no real squeeze or pressure so with volatility at 200% annualised, you need a doubling and a doubling in order to start to lose money and I think this is a perfect opportunity for options sellers, not buyers, to take advantage.”

Now... What this scrotum says about the borrowing rate is true it's complete horeshit it should be so much higher however once again the buying power of retail is being played down and it's FUD which I will continue to prove wrong.

The original plan for hedgefunds was to bankrupt gamestop, that is no longer possible for them. So they have now dug a hole so deep for themselves I only see three.. really only two ways out for them.

1. They drag this on for so long and slowly and surely start covering positions but still end up driving GME into the thousands per share, making money off the options market to stay afloat. (Not possible imo but could be a plan for them)
2. Somebody calls forces them to cover, they get liquidated.
3. They just nuke the market and hope for a bailout and hope that some of their assets are protected.

Whatever happens apes will get paid but it's just at what scale do apes get paid but thankfully apes have control over that as there will soon be a legal obligation to buy back shares at **ANY** **PRICE** until diamond apes deem the price acceptable and of course $10m is the floor.

Enough ranting.. time for stonk math.

**10% of all shares traded in March** \-  67,715,783.5 shares or 253.96% of the float.

**5% of all shares traded in March** \-  33,857,891.75 shares or 126.98% of the float.

**10% Diamond hand total  Jan - Mar -**  276,591,173.50 shares or 1037.31% of the float.

**5% of diamond hands through Jan - Mar -** 138,295,586.75 shares or 518.65% of the float

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!

Lowest volume month yet! Diamond hands are JACKED....

Such a great quote, may it live forever. So back to April.. I'll just get right into the stonk math as this is probably becoming an essay and I haven't even showed all the data as I've organised all mondays and broken these down into weeks as well as just months. Maybe I'll just do a part 2 if apes want to see more data and get that sweet sweet confirmation bias but all in good time. FUCK! Stop rambling you ape talk about the numbers!!!

Yes the numbers!  171,183,615 million shares traded last month BY FARRRRRRRRR the lowest volume of the year. 64.2%

**10% of all shares traded in Apr** \-  17,118,361.50 shares or 64.2%% of the float.

**5% of all shares traded in Apr** \-   8,559,180.75 shares or shares or 32.10% of the float.

**10% Diamond hand total  Jan - Apr -**  293,709,535 shares or 1101.51% of the float.

**5% of diamond hands through Jan - Apr -** 146,854,767.50  shares or 550.75% of the float.

The post I made last week touched on how I believe retail own more than 1000% of the float

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/myu2v6/since\_jan\_4th\_on\_average\_the\_gme\_float\_has\_been/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/myu2v6/since_jan_4th_on_average_the_gme_float_has_been/)

Now here we are apes. I want to just say that with this information I am making no recommendations, I'm putting no dates on wen moon, how moon or any price predictions. All I'm saying to you is this... If these stupid fucks want to keep shorting this stock and fueling the rocket and they want to keep giving out tickets. I'll keep fucking buying them... The longer this goes on the more tickets I will have so shills, hedgies or just general ball bags reading this if you want to continue to delay the squeeze thank you very much for the discount and the opportunity to buy more. I was always told as a kid "play stupid games, win stupid prizes" Well hedgies you've been playing stupid games for a LONG time and you thought you could put the apes back in the cages once they broke out but no... the apes know your tricks now and if you want to play games... lets fucking play.

[Apes set highscores. ](https://preview.redd.it/jaag8nwpdrw61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a579b12b8a871dad8c229cd55db90606aefedc8a)

**TLDR -** From the start of the 2021 GME has had almost 3B shares traded with an average volume of 35.8m per day which is 134.33% of the float traded everyday for the past four months. This data only includes the volume reported by the NYSE this doesn't include the darkpools, OTC, future options etc and as this is up until the end of April as we are now in May this data will continue to build until the squeeze is squoze. This also doesn't include any data before 2021 so anyone who purchased shares before GME went mainstream won't be included in this data. With that said if retail investors have accounted for 10% of all GME volume since the start of 2021 they would own 1101.51% of the float. This is speculative DD and not to be taken as concrete.
