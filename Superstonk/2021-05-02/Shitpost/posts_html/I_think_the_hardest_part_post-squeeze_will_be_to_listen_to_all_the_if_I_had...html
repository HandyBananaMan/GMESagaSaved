<h1>Title: I think the hardest part post-squeeze will be to listen to all the "if I had only known..". Or the "Wow you got lucky". We apes tried to make as much noise as possible, and if I managed to read enough DD to justify geting on the rocket with my XX IQ points, well then anyone could have!</h1>

<p>Im obviously not encuraging anyone to be disrespectful towards anyone who could have been unfortunate enough to not cross paths with GME before the squeeze. This is only towards those who had the possibility and access to the facts, but who couldnt handle the risk enough to buy even one or a few tickets to make sure they wouldnt get left behind.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, holy crap, I made it mom!ü¶ç</p>
