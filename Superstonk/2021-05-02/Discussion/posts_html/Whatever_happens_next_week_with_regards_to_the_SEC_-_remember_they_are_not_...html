<p>The January "incident" was incredibly serious.  Rather than getting off their asses and doing their jobs the SEC have given the hedgefunds THREE WHOLE MONTHS to try to defeat us.</p>
<p>Lets recap some of the tools the hedgefunds have had at their disposal during these three months :</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Social media infiltration / Manipulation</li>
<li>Misinformation and lies in the broadcast media across the board</li>
<li>High frequency trading manipulation and fuckery</li>
<li>Resetting FTD time limits with even more fuckery</li>
<li>Naked Short selling</li>
</ol>
<p>They have been able to run wild for three months.  Only now do I get the impression that the SEC know they have no choice but to step in.    The SEC wouldn't have even put out  a press statement if we had all sold up and gone home.   </p>
<p>The SEC is not your friend.</p>
