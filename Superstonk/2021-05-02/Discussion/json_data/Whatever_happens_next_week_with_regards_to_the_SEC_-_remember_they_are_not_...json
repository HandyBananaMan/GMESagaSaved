    "selftext": "The January \"incident\" was incredibly serious.  Rather than getting off their asses and doing their jobs the SEC have given the hedgefunds THREE WHOLE MONTHS to try to defeat us.\n\nLets recap some of the tools the hedgefunds have had at their disposal during these three months :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Social media infiltration / Manipulation\n2. Misinformation and lies in the broadcast media across the board\n3. High frequency trading manipulation and fuckery\n4. Resetting FTD time limits with even more fuckery\n5. Naked Short selling\n\nThey have been able to run wild for three months.  Only now do I get the impression that the SEC know they have no choice but to step in.    The SEC wouldn't have even put out  a press statement if we had all sold up and gone home.   \n\nThe SEC is not your friend.",
