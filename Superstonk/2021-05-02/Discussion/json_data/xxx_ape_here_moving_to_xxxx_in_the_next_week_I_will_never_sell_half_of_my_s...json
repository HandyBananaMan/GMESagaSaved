    "selftext": "I see new posts worring about xxx and xxxx apes selling in the low 5 figure range as this would put those gains in the 7 and 8 figure range. This theory is completely false for my situation, and possibly other's. I started off with 14 shares in Jan looking to pay off a couple small loans. Now that this has dragged out for months, my motives for holding have shifted. If the float is 26m, only xxx,xxx apes or less, holding >xxx shares, need to hold and the float will never be covered. An unintended consequence to this is that xx and x share apes will be set for life. Sorry, hedgefucks! Tenders are nice, changing financial market and the lives of millions of apes is what will bring the most joy to me. Not financial advice, do what you want. I just like the stock. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18\ud83e\udd18",
