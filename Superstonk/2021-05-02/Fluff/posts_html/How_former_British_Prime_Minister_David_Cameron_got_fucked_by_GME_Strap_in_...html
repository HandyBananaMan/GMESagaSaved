<p>Time for some quality banter.</p>
<p>No TLDR becasue it isn't really that long. Also no links other than the one below. We should encourage each other to do our own research. That, and I'm so giddy at the prospect of writing this I can't be arsed.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, take a look at this post which isn't getting as much attention as it deserves</p>

<p>Archegos over leveraged gets margin called.</p>
<p>Greensill Captial were tied into Archegos</p>
<p>Credit Suisse freezes 10 bill headed for Greensill</p>
<p>David Cameron lobbied for Greensill</p>
<p>Greensill were largest investors in Liberty Steel</p>
<p>David Cameron had up to 60 million to make from Liberty Steel IF...</p>
<p>David Cameron could convince UK government to save Liberty from liquidation</p>
<p>He failed.</p>
<p>Cameron is now looking at public enquiry (fuck all will come of it)</p>
<p>That above link shows Archegos was likely unloaded with debt from Melvin losing out on GME</p>
<p>Money moved to Cayman Islands</p>
<p>Boom, Archegos takes the fall becasue Bill Huang is a crook and the fall guy</p>
<p>David Cameron 60 mill down thanks to GME.</p>
<p>Love it</p>
<p>Edit: as a side note, the ham faced Etonian pig fucker was actually trying to secure public funds to prop up a private company to secure his investments. Prick.</p>
