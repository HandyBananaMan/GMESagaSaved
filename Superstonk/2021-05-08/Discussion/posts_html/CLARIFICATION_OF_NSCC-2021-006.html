<p>I got tired of commenting to a ton of people and decided to make a post about it. Mind you I have no wrinkle in my brain at all and might have some part of it wrong, but my god the amount of people just accepting what the top post about it is telling them, when it's completely wrong.</p>
<p>Paste from my last comment written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rules aren't going to be passed quickly at all. That's not how any of this works. The top thread about this that was first posted is COMPLETELY WRONG. This rule (changes) still has to be approved by the SEC. This is nothing new. Each and every rule that the NSCC, DTCC, or whoever thinks up, is always approved by some board in-house first and then gets sent to the SEC for approval. You can look at any rule posted on the DTCC site, read into the like second or third page, they are all "approved" by a board of that agency before sending it to the SEC. There is not fast-tracking of new rules. Once a rule is submitted to the SEC for "approval/no objection" (45 days), THEN the ~~DTCC~~ NSCC can implement the rule IMMEDIATELY without the 10 day notice period for it's members. This rule isn't what anyone thinks it is. That original thread got WAY out of hand, some mod should have stepped in and shut it down or clarified a while ago because now we are going to be dealing with this all weekend.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm off to bed. I appreciate the comments and discussion that has happened in this thread so far. I'll review and reply to all who directly commented to me in the morning. Have a great night/day everyone!</p>
