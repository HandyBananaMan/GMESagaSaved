<p>Social media allows for outreach to the entire world. If they commit absolute corruption (not saying I truly think they will - even though they ARE absolutely corrupt, they just have a lot to gain personally as well), I will devote my time to an all out fucking non-stop campaign to get everyone I can out of the US markets across every single social media platform in existence. I hope this community will get behind that goal in a situation where the regulatory bodies go against the retail investors on this. It will be my fucking burning desire and goal to shrink the entry of new investors into US markets and grow the volume of investors exiting the US markets. Every. Single. Fucking. Day.</p>
<p>Edit: want to reiterate, I do not believe they would stop the squeeze, as stated in the post. Making that clear for those that skim the post and miss my comment about I donâ€™t think they will and they have a lot to gain as well</p>
