If they didn\u2019t sell in jan, which could\u2019ve explained the >100% inst ownership numbers, they will certainly see this through. And more than the OS is held for sure now. This is a massive data milestone that I have been silently worried about, and everyone should realize how bullish this is. And don\u2019t give me bs about we don\u2019t need Blackrock etc that\u2019s not the point, if you can\u2019t appreciate the significance dont comment bruh",
