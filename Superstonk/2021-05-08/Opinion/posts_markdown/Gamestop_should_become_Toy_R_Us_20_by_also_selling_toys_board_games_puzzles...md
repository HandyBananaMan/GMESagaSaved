# Title: Gamestop should become Toy R Us 2.0 by also selling toys, board games, puzzles etc. There's a need for a decent online hobby store.

Why stop at just video games? GME should be the phoenix rising out of Toys R Us ashes. There's already so much beautiful irony in what caused Toys R Us to fail is what caused GME to flourish. Hedgies took down Toys R Us, but Toys R Us 2.0 took down the hedgies.

I rather give GME my business than Amazon on any day. There's so much room for potential expansion.
