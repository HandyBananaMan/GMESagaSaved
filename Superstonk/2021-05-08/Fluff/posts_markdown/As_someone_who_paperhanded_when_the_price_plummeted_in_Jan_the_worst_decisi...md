I had been investing for 2 weeks when the price hit $480 in January. I had read a few DDs, learned the definition of short selling, but that was pretty much it. My appetite for risk was low but I believed in the squeeze just enough to hold until I saw red in my account. It was the first time I had “lost” money in stocks and it was fucking scary, so I pulled out.

I feel like I was a completely different person back then. I actually looked to the mainstream media to tell me when the squeeze was over! But when we saw that DFV had doubled his position, I knew something was up. I started reading DD again, and a week later I had a position 2x larger than I had before. I transferred to Fidelity, where I plan to diamond hand every one of my shares until every HF short on GME has collapsed in on itself like a dying star.

The months of reading DD, researching new topics and wrapping my mind around how huge this squeeze is gonna be has sealed their fates. They made a bet that retail would give up the second we faced any conflict, and it was the worst bet ever made on Wallstreet.

I also wanna thank all you apes who held the line during the first squeeze. You truly have diamond fucking balls/vulva. Us baby apes wouldn’t be here right now if it weren’t for you!
