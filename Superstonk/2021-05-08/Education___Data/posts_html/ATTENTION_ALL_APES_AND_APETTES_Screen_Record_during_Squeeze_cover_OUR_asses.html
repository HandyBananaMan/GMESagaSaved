<p>I’ve been reading a lot of justifiable discussion from multiple subs about certain Brokers potentially making it “more difficult” to buy and/or sell during the squeeze. </p>
<p>As a rule... I automatically activate screen record when anything.... and i mean anything unusual occurs during the day. (Iphone) slow ticker, abnormal jumps or declines, loss of signal, app reset for no reason, any weird glitch, slow or unable to trade, numbers not refreshing, etc. As well as before and after every transaction.</p>
<p>I will be activating SCREEN RECORD when the squeeze begins in order to document each and every move i make. </p>
<p>I’d highly recommend that all Apes do the exact same thing. If you are trading on a lap or desktop... do the same. Don’t know how?.... you need to figure it out now and be prepared to use it.</p>
<p>If any abnormal trading practices occur we will all have combined verifiable proof. I don’t have to go into depth about all the possible methods of confusion that will be implemented, because you are all well aware of what we are up against. </p>
<p>With our combined mass documentation across ALL platforms and Brokers we will have a complete picture of the entire PROCESS from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You do not have to record from bell to bell.... as this will take multiple days to fully manifest.... you should, however, start recording before you make any moves or change from screen to screen.</p>
<p>I know I’m posting this late so it might not get that much traction so I’ll try to post it again. </p>
<p>Please cross post this so ALL can see or upvote it to get it seen. This is an extremely important step and is not controversial nor financial advice so it should not offend anyone... we are all here for the same reason and this is a simple way to keep the checks and balances of our system documented. The more Apes and Apettes that document this historic event the clearer the picture will be and between the millions of us we should be able to document every single second. If a mass anomaly or forced error does occur, we can prove it was not an isolated event.... as many will  undoubtedly try to convince. This is the LAST thing “THEY” want us to do. Besides selling.</p>
<p>Also.... won’t it be cool to go back and watch the millions rolling into your accounts!?!?! Trust me it will be a blur while it is happening!</p>
<p>I like the Stonk.... patience produces the sweetest fruits.... harvest when ripe.
