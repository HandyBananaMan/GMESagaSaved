Was just spending some quality Sunday reading time browsing through Fintel reports... as you do... and I came across some shit that may mean nothing, but may be worth putting some collective brain power into. 

Let's start with $HYG

When Kenny sent in his 13F-HR in Feb, he has $0 worth of shares of this ETF. Date: 16 Feb 2021

His latest filing shows that he as added to this ETF to his portfolio, but only $43 million worth of shares. 

More interestingly though, as we know Kenny loves to short shit, is that he also owns $650 million calls and $2.5 billion worth of puts. 

This is no small amount even for Kenny. 

So... let's take a look at Citadel overall. 

His latest filling shows that he currently has $407 billion AUM. 

He has 13,104 positions
Has been closing a lot of positions since his last filing with 1048 closed. (Someone need some capital?)

But...

He's only opened 5 new positions. 

So after the Jan ðŸ˜¨ for him, he no doubt has been trying to take a step back, reposition himself in order "To continue to fight, to stay alive for 1 more day at a time"

So what has he decided are the most critical positions for him to be in that he previously did not have?

So the 5 new positions that Kenny has been buying up, are mainly bonds...

Teradyne Inc Bond (US:880770AG7)
Insulet Corp Bond (US:45784PAH4)
Teladoc Health Inc Bond (US:87918AAC9)
CONV. NOTE (US:98954MAG6)

And 1 stock:

Sea Ltd (KY:81141RAD2)

And we know from the $HYG example, that he is also adding to existing Bond positions. 

What does this mean?

No fucking clue - I like drawing triangles on charts with crayons and didn't pay attention in school so don't understand fundamentals of business, not amind how a hedge fund positions themselves across multiple businesses/securities

- But let's look at what else is going on here from the FREE version of Fintel. (I refuse to pay for the premium version, as if I had any money, I'd be buying GME with it)

Ok... 

So Citadels main positions and the positions it is mostly known for are:

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (US:SPY)
Tesla Motors, Inc. (US:TSLA) (Wink wink Michael Burry)
Amazon.com, Inc. (US:AMZN)

Ok no surprises here really, except the Burry short position on Tesla (Genius), I wonder if he has a short on Amazon?

All mainstream positions

But...

Let's look at the main industries that Kenny has positioned himself in?

Fishing hunting and trapping (4lolz: He needs this to learn how to avoid being hunted by Apes)

Legal Services (4lolz: He def gonna need this when the hunt is over)

Miscellaneous Repair Services (4lolz: Needs this to try keep himself alive longer)

Ok so, lols aside. This is a little more unusual. What is the significance of these seemingly random industries for Kenny to be involved in? 

Fair enough legal, that's kinda mainstream, but hunting and trapping?

What does this all mean?

Haven't a clue...

This is all I can determine from the FREE version of Fintel. 

Does anyone that has the paid version, and a few wrinkles have more information ðŸ¤”?

What does the move to bonds mean ðŸ¤”?

Why is his closing position ration 250/1 ðŸ¤”?

This sadly is as far as my smooth brain can go... I leave this in the hands of those who are better Apes than Me.

Is this a journey worth continuing down?

IMO, I think understanding how a trapped rat reacts to the environment it finds itself in, is worth understanding if you wish to trap that rat. 

TLDR: Kenny's a trapped rat
