**TL;DR:**

* **RSA, which owns 55 Water Street where the DTCC is located, and David Bronner have been criticized for failing to include an independent fiduciary counsel for RSA.**
* **Alabama Policy Institute argues that RSA has been losing money for pensioners; this echoes calls by many saying that Bronner is making money and investments (golf courses, hotels) off public money.**
* **55 Water Street was purchased in part due to a buyout, but largely as a result of a sting operation against the NYC Italian mob. NYC's then District Attorney Morganthou had links to Alabama.**

Hallo fellow apes! Today, I saw a recent comment saying that some of you weekend DD warriors wish there was some more DD or possible DD posts on weekends, and I might have something to scratch that itch along with the great posts I've already seen today on reverse repo & crypto, more drone/camera shots, etc.!

Plus, I appreciate all the apes making DTCC memes on David Inggs and the like.

Credit to u/Trendingmemes for this one, as well as any other Inggs memes I might have missed!

So to introduce, I made my first post on 55 Water some time back (you can see that here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwpmtw/who\_owns\_55\_water\_street\_in\_nyc\_the\_building/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwpmtw/who_owns_55_water_street_in_nyc_the_building/)). To reiterate that post's DD, here's some TLDR:

* **55 Water purchased by Retirement Systems of Alabama in 1993 for $202 million. Head is David Bronner.**
* **DTCC is the largest tenant in 55 Water St.**
* **RSA filing in 2008 said "RSA is the retirement system for Alabama state and local employees. RSA does not engage outside professional money managers, but instead relies on an in-house investment staff to manage more than $30 billion in assets. At the time of the events described in this report, RSA had no policies, procedures, training or compliance officer to ensure its compliance with the federal securities laws."**
* **One article alludes to Bronner as being "the most powerful man in Alabama" and discusses RSA's other holdings including golf courses and hotels**

As a quick note, between this (55 Water Street) and my UBS & Adoboli (just finished part 5 on 2014-2020, you can see that here "GME Player Profile: UBS | Naked Shorts & 2011's Adoboli (Episode 5: 2014-2021 The Present)": [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ntf0hl/gme\_player\_profile\_ubs\_naked\_shorts\_2011s\_adoboli/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ntf0hl/gme_player_profile_ubs_naked_shorts_2011s_adoboli/)), **I might end up taking more time to dig this rabbit hole and may be aim for a Part 3. Alabama Reporter reported that there is a book on David Bronner and RSA by Dr. Mark Fagan called “Alabama’s Public Pension Fund Growth and Economic Expansions since 1972” that I will try to get my hands on to add more to this series.**

Without further ado:

# 0. Introduction

*“What’s in your wallet, Alabama?”*That’s how one article “Retirement Systems of Alabama owns a Manhattan skyscraper? What else?” starts in a photo essay detailing the major holdings of RSA, the owner of 55 Water St. which houses the DTCC.

For some more background, that article opens with the following:

“The Retirement Systems of Alabama is one of the 20 largest internally funded pension funds in the world. The recent sale of Raycom Media, where RSA had a sizeable investment, is just the latest activity for the mammoth fund, which started in the 1970s with $500 million. Under the direction of CEO David Bronner, RSA manages three large funds - the Teacher Retirement System, Employee Retirement System and Judicial Retirement Fund. Together, they represent $36.7 billion. Altogether, RSA manages 23 funds with $41.5 billion in assets.”

&#x200B;

![David Bronner of RSA](https://preview.redd.it/hrv3qmg5j3571.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d7d9eccf3fc320edd7325d6e7c4c7e58acd1d50)

Good to neutral things that David Bronner & RSA has done:

* Former University of Alabama Law School Dean from 1972-1973
* Pensions & Investments & Alabama Reporter mentions RSA, which Bronner has lead for 45 years, a now $30.9 billion fund. It says it has helped to develop the state’s economy through tourism and investment in hotels & golf courses
* Alabama Reporter reported that when he took hold of RSA, it had $500 million. According to an alreporter.com article, it was now worth $43.8 billion, **making RSA the 50th largest pension** ***in the world.*** **(Yes, Alabama.)**

So definitely, Bronner is a big player. (Of comparison to other wealthy and/or important individuals in Alabama, in 2016, Forbes reported that the “Richest Person in America’s 50 Largest Cities in the US” was worth 600 million for the state of Alabama’s largest city. In 2018, Forbes reported that Alabama’s Richest Person in the State was worth 800 million.)

RSA, however, is known for its great investing acumen from what we see. Pension and Investments reported on RSA in “Investments in Alabama Paying Off”, where the reporter discussed how RSA was hoping its investment in hotels would net a strong 12% return.

&#x200B;

![RSA Building in Alabama](https://preview.redd.it/ih6mg2y7j3571.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e7ad791bb04e7c13cd9f86d3c1e0bb0573a6666)

Saying of the CEO of the then- $30.9 billion fund, “\[Bronner\] — who has been long involved in developing the state’s tourism industry through plush golf courses and luxury hotels — said when the last of the eight hotels opens early next year, the fund will have invested more than $550 million.” Even Bronner himself admitted the push for investment in real estate, particularly hotels and golf courses, was not usual:

>**“This kind of investing is unusual for pension funds**, but Mr. Bronner believes in taking a broad view. “I have to change the state to make the pension fund go,” he said. “It’s necessary to make sure that there is economic development and an economy that can pay their pensions, otherwise the pension’s no good.””

&#x200B;

![Robert Jones Trail, RSA holding in Alabama](https://preview.redd.it/3xkx7gtaj3571.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f6be76a72a4df9f3d4143ab8cd250899fb7e8a)

&#x200B;

Alabama Reporter speaks highly of Bronner often. It mentioned that the Robert Jones Trail in particular has helped to renovate the state’s image. I mean, listen to this heartwarming vignette:

>“The courses have made Alabama a tourist destination.  It brings well-heeled northern golfers to our state for week long stays who spend untold amounts of money in our hotels and restaurants.  Snowbird golf enthusiasts are locked out of their courses six to seven months of the year.  They journey to warm climes of the Heart of Dixie to play these world class courses.  They might look at the adjoining hole and see Dr. Bronner playing, chomping on his ever-present cigar.”

Recall again, 55 Water is listed as a huge entity for RSA. In “Retirement Systems of Alabama owns a Manhattan skyscraper? What else?”, it says “The largest commercial office building in Manhattan, RSA purchased the property in 1993. The 3.8 million square feet of rentable space is now worth $1.5 billion, and generates more than $155 million in revenue a year.” 55 Water St. is pretty much RSA’s biggest and most important holding. If you Google them (or let's say, much better DuckDuckGo them), you will see the word "RSA" and "55 Water Street" together often.

# 1. A Polite History of 55 Water St. (1960s to 1990s)

NYT’s Alan Oser wrote in “Downtown is Looking Up” about 55 Water’s history:

“Its saga began in the late 60's when builders were taking advantage of a widening of Water Street that the City Planning Commission initiated specifically to direct office growth in the financial district to the eastern rim of lower Manhattan. The Uris brothers -- Percy and Harold -- were the builders.

>**With a total of 3.6 million square feet of space, it is the** ***(then, emphasis OP's***\*\*) second largest privately owned office building in the country, behind Sears Tower in Chicago, which has 3.8 million square feet\*\*.

Remember again, this was 1993, around the time Trimbath (Queen Kong! OOK OOK!) was yelling deuces to the DTCC.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

![Queen Kong!!!](https://preview.redd.it/mnqqe7rgj3571.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd0c7061a58fba2960e9be084a2c0f3db0ede6c)

>The vacancy rate climbed as high as 40 percent -- about 1.5 million square feet in 1993 -- with move-outs by big investment firms. Olympia & York, no longer in a position to get the financing to carry out the asbestos removal and other major improvement work necessary to attract or hold major tenants, relinquished the ownership to its bondholder-creditors. **The largest one, the Retirement Systems of Alabama, bought out the other bondholders.**  
>  
>A key goal was to win a renewal lease in 1995 from the Depository Trust Company, a longterm tenant, said Edward J. Kulik Jr., director of the investment management division of Jones Lang Wootton U.S.A., who is in charge of leasing. Depository Trust renewed to the year 2018, taking an additional 180,000 square feet for a total of 500,000 square feet, Mr. Kulik said.

\[Regarding one such deal at 55 Water. I will need to clarify this in an edit\]: "Expressing optimism, Brian Given, the broker in charge, said that as soon as Standard & Poor's signed at 55 Water Street, ''we became the only building in the state of New York that can offer a million-plus square feet under one roof.'"

# 2. A Closer Look at 55 Water: RSA and the Building in the 1990s-Early 2000s

Referencing the same article, NYT’s Alan Oser wrote in “Downtown is Looking Up” about a lease agreement at 55 Water that helped to revitalize the area. It opens the article stating “The 55 Water Street saga is only the latest example of a comeback, building by building, of prime properties that took heavy blows from bankruptcies, contractions, restructuring and move-outs in the early 90's. Some buildings have been able to use the period, sometimes under changed ownership, to put themselves in position to compete for major tenants when the market improved.”Harold McGraw III (of McGraw-Hill, as in USA school textbooks) finalized the deal with Bronner for 15 floors over 20 years. **The owner was New Street Corp, an affiliate of RSA.** This all sounds like a boring deal. **The article mentions that the property was given up by Olympia & York Properties, a Canadian development company headed by the Reichmann family in Toronto, to its creditor-bondholders in the early 90s. F**rom that time, vacancies went from 40% to 2%.

John Powers, who advised McGraw-Hill, stated that there is a “flight to quality” during a real-estate recession. Among the corporations that had originally been looking at 55 Water leasing was Goldman Sachs. Eventually, they opted for 10 Hanover Square, and the space went to Standard & Poor’s (S&P, a la SPY).

According to the NYT, around that year of 1993, brokerage reports showed “seven of the 10 largest recent leasing deals have been in the so-called Financial East district on or near Water Street.” 55 Water St.’s renewal in the wake of the deal brought it up to a Class A building.*(As a quick follow-up, I will also reference later an ape's comment to me that this seems to be semi-normal, and that other pension funds and the like from other states also own property in Midtown NYC/Manhattan.)*

&#x200B;

![55 Water post-renovations in more modern times](https://preview.redd.it/66naemrqj3571.png?width=1530&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe282e726d7864c40ce202c13f3cae0a7ebacc0)

RSA, as discussed in my 1st post on 55 Water, had done a great deal of restoration for the building. The Decatur Daily reported that the building had a plaza built next to it in 1985, but that RSA helped to fundraise in 1999 and renovate the plaza in 2001. It served in part to honor Vietnam Veterans from NYC there. They also honored RSA and Bronner for this:

>“Friends of the Vietnam Veterans Plaza presented Retirement Systems CEO David Bronner with its second Honoree of the Year Award at a luncheon in New York. The first recipient was former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.  Harry Bridgewood, chairman of the group, said the award to Bronner was really to the people of Alabama for their support in making the plaza "one of the more beautiful spaces in the city." \*\*State taxes support the Alabama pension system run by Bronner...\*\*Marc Reynolds, deputy director for the Retirement Systems, said Thursday that when the pension program bought the office building it came with an obligation to maintain the plaza.”

# 3. A Closer-er Look at 55 Water Street: RSA, David Bronner in the 2000s-2020s

Bronner & RSA have not been without issues. To name a few:

1. RSA was a backer of a luxury movie chain iPic, and eventually was part of lending a $16 million loan to the company dealing with bankruptcy. (Need more info on this, need more access to the article and relevant sources).
2. **Bronner was part of the push to oust then CEO David Siegel from his position in US Airways in 2004.**
3. Mike Cason of al.com reported in “David Bronner opposes board move to hire own attorney” that a board meeting in the past few years had a proposal for the RSA to hire a lawyer--an independent fiduciary counsel--die on a contentious 6-6- vote.

On that vote (note I will quote heavily from this as feel a lot of great information):

>**“The proposal called for the lawyer to help write a code of ethics related to companies that RSA has a stake in as a private equity owner or as a lender. RSA designates one or more corporate board members for a few of those companies in which it has so-called "private placement" investments, meaning they weren't made through a public stock market or bond market. Supporters of hiring the independent counsel said they wanted a code of ethics to prohibit RSA-appointed members to those corporate boards from enriching themselves through dealings with those companies. The code would also apply to RSA employees.**  
>  
>"We consider it of the utmost importance, as well as part of our fiduciary duty, to ensure that anyone associated with RSA assets to be free of conflicts," ERS Board Vice Chairwoman Jackie Graham said in a statement at the board meeting.”

So we have the RSA, owner of the DTCC (an SRO, or self-regulation organization) and its building in 55 Water Street, pushing for lack of regulation and wanting to continue to act like an SRO itself. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree?

More on this article, since I think Cason covered a lot of great info. He really catches Bronner’s view on this (note that I have adjusting the order of some of the sentences from the original article):

>**“"How the hell am I supposed to sit here and run an organization and have two different lawyers telling me two different things?" Bronner said in an interview after the meeting. "How dumb would that be?"**  
>  
>Bronner, who has led the RSA since 1973, said it would be unworkable for the ERS Board and the RSA to have separate legal counsels. RSA has a staff of lawyers led by General Counsel Leura Canary.  
>  
>**Bronner said he was not opposed to a code of ethics but questioned the need.** He noted that he and RSA employees are bound by the state ethics law, which prohibits using their state position for personal gain. Bronner said corporations have audit committees and disclosure requirements that scrutinize business relationships with corporate board members. But Deputy Revenue Commissioner Stewart said he would like to have an ethics code that would not leave it up to the corporate entities to settle potential conflicts involving RSA-appointed board members.  
>  
>**"If it were me, whether required by state law or not, I would say that if you are representing us on one of these boards, you should not have any business dealings with that company, none at all," Stewart said. "Even if they are disclosed. Even if they are at the same price that everybody else could do."**  
>  
>The dispute has simmered for several months. **Some board members said they were surprised to learn that Bruce Hodges, a long-time associate of Bronner, received commission for insurance sold to New Water Street Corporation, an RSA-owned company that owns 55 Water Street, the largest office building in New York. Hodges also served on the board for New Water Street. Hodges resigned from the New Water Street board and several others affiliated with the RSA after questions arose.**  
>  
>In a memo to board members in September, Bronner said Hodges resigned to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest. **Bronner said Hodges has been a valuable resource for RSA through his insurance expertise for decades. He said Hodges discovered that RSA was receiving $250 million in insurance for 55 Water Street while paying for twice that much and was integral in collecting large claims for damages to RSA properties caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.**  
>  
>Canary said she's had outside lawyers with expertise in the field review the draft code of ethics. She said she is open to suggestions from the ERS Board but has received none.  
>  
>"I would like to see the people who sit on these boards have a code of conduct on how they operate and how they have to approach their positions," Stewart said. "Maybe they all approach it that way anyway. **But I would like to see that written in a code. And for the staff attorney to tell us that's not necessary, or to write a code or to have a code drafted that to me look like it's got holes in it, I would at least, before I accept that code, run it by somebody that I consider not conflicted."**

To reiterate some of the biggest parts, **we have some questions about Bruce Hodges, a long-time associate of Bronner, receiving commission for insurance sold to New Water Street Corp., which is affiliated with Bronner and RSA. A wave of resignations came out after this information was disclosed to the public. Not only that, but Bronner is pushing for big “go fuck yourself” energy on an independent board to review RSA’s holdings and conflicts of interest.**

So there have been some major concerns about RSA in recent years despite some great returns for Alabama’s pension fund and more.I tried to look up some more criticism on RSA and found this opinion piece that offered some interesting threads to pull further.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j79g8bd3k3571.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c128e05c195628d7b0205aec7ad84ec0ee29066

In Yellowhammer’s (Yellowhammer says in its "About Us" on its website that it is Alabama's 2nd largest media outlet) “How an Alabama state employee built a billionaire’s lifestyle in a taxpayer-funded job (opinion)” by writer Cliff Sims, the author speaks about Bronner. It opens: “According to Forbes Magazine, Alabama is currently home to exactly zero billionaires. **But if you spent a day with the state’s highest paid government employee, you might assume Forbes must have overlooked something.”**

It proceeds with a very unflattering tone on Bronner and RSA. I can’t do most of this justice as summary, so here are some of the biggest things that the author says (Note, I am still trying to group the Alabama Policy Institute paper referenced):

“From a palatial office overseeing downtown Montgomery, Bronner manages the pension fund for employees of the state of Alabama, including teachers. **Through some early successes and some crafty propaganda — much of it published in the RSA’s own newsletter — Dr. Bronner’s reputation as an investment wizard has endured, even as his pension fund has deteriorated to the point that Alabama taxpayers are compelled to contribute roughly $1 billion per year to prop it up.**

>**A research paper published by the Alabama Policy Institute last year estimates that the collective Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA)—the Teachers Retirement System (TRS), Employees Retirement System (ERS), and Judicial Retirement Fund (JRF)—have $29.4 billion in assets, and $44.6 billion in liabilities.**  
>  
>**In other words, the RSA is** ***short*** \*\*(\*\****chihuahua meme intensifies)*** **for current and future retirees by $15.2 billion.** According to the paper, between 2003 and 2013 the unfunded liability for the RSA grew from a manageable $2.1 billion to the $15.2 billion it is today—putting each of Alabama’s 4.8 million residents on the hook for $3,166, or $8,724 per household.  
>  
>“This massive $13.1 billion increase in RSA’s unfunded liability equates to an increase of over $1.3 billion per year, $109 million each month, or nearly $4 million for each day that elected officials did nothing to fix this problem,” the paper detailed. “For a bit of perspective, the total current debt outstanding for the entire State of Alabama (every public school building, every public college or university, every road or bridge, every economic incentive, the Port Authority, Mental Health, the Revolving Loan Fund, the Tobacco bonds, all of the state’s general obligation and revenue bonds) is only about $8.8 billion or $4,786 per household.”  
>  
>**This year alone, the state must send nearly $1 billion to the RSA, or 12 percent of the education and general fund budgets combined, making retirement systems contributions the second largest budget item after education.**  
>  
>RSA has dismissed the study as fear mongering. But the fact remains that RSA’s investment returns are not high enough to keep up with its obligations.  
>  
>**In the midst of it all, Dr. Bronner has built for himself a lavish lifestyle that far exceeds his roughly $600,000 taxpayer-funded salary.**  
>  
>**An avid golfer, he has used RSA funds to build golf resorts around the state, which lose roughly $20 million per year.** Resort employees told Yellowhammer on condition of anonymity that Dr. Bronner is a frequent and demanding guest in the hotels’ priciest suites.  
>  
>Dr. Bronner has dismissed the financial losses by saying the golf courses and resort hotels attract tourism dollars to the state that are not directly reflected in their bottom line. **Critics have responded by saying that even if that is true, it is his job to get the largest return possible for state employees, not to use their pension fund as an economic development loss leader.**  
>  
>**The golf courses’ logo also appears on two private jets that Dr. Bronner uses to travel all over the country, rather than flying commercial.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

![Per Yellowhammer the type of private jet that RSA\/Bronner uses](https://preview.redd.it/b0ab1d56k3571.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b51ccecc643df5df946da561e6c9468cb24354)

Of note, Sims and/or Yellowhammer has asked RSA General Counsel Leura Canary for flight logs on the jets.

“RSA does not own any jets and consequently has no flight logs,” she replied. When pressed to explain the use of the jets, Mrs. Canary said they are owned by RSA investments Raycom Media (sound familiar from the beginning of this post?) and CNHI. She also provided an opinion from the state Ethics Commission that said Dr. Bronner traveling on the plane is “analogous to using a state car for business travel.”

Y**ellowhammer replied by pointing out that if traveling on the plane is the same as using a state car, as the Ethics Commission wrote, then travel records should be made available to the public. They are not.**

&#x200B;

![Interior](https://preview.redd.it/p4c0gc39k3571.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b37897e34aca3f91d40e52bae28823789e52d5)

“Additionally, why not fly commercial — even if it’s business class?” Yellowhammer asked. “The cost per variable hour on those planes as $2,639.41. That makes a trip to NYC (approximately) $15,000 or a flight to Palm Beach $8,000. Meanwhile, the rest of us could fly to NYC for $400.”

Mrs. Canary’s response was that, “The flight logs of a private corporation are not subject to the Open Records Act.”

**She also insists that flying private actually saves RSA and its investments money.”**

**To reiterate, the Alabama Policy Institute says that RSA is not doing nearly as well as it says it is, and is actually short the money needed for Alabama’s state pensioners. Furthermore, Bronner and RSA make full use of a private jet as a way to save money for RSA and its investments...somehow.**

The piece further discusses how RSA’s proposed calculations on saving itself money are baseless, and says Bronner--in the author’s opinion--considers himself to be his own Warren Buffett. The author mentions quote stating that Bronner told the Alabama State Employees Association in a speech that the Koch brothers were coming for their pension. The author then adds near the tail end of their piece:

&#x200B;

>“Here are the facts:  
>  
>**The RSA’s investments will return about 1% this year. The golf courses lose about $20 million per year. Alabama taxpayers are forced to contribute roughly $1 billion per year to the system to keep it afloat.**  
>  
>**Meanwhile Dr. Bronner is traversing the country in private jets and spending his time in luxury hotel suites and on golf courses funded by RSA investments, and dolling out bonuses to his investment staff ranging from $3,371 to $51,199.**  
>  
>**His explanation for the bonuses was that they were necessary to keep his employees from leaving for the private sector.**  
>  
>“They’ll stay awhile and they start getting hungry for the real big dollars and they leave me,” he said. “So we came up with a method.”  
>  
>So why isn’t Dr. Bronner any different? He is making just shy of $600,000 per year. Couldn’t he make much more if he jumped to the private sector?  
>  
>Perhaps.  
>  
>**Instead he opted to build a billionaire’s lifestyle without the risk of doing it in the private sector, where 1% returns wouldn’t buy the jets and all the fancy resorts.**  
>  
>**The Alabama legislature is currently wrestling with much-needed reforms to the state’s public pension system, and some lawmakers are considering legislation that would make the RSA a much more open and transparent entity.**  
>  
>Such reforms should be no-brainers for the Republican supermajority.”

I have yet to verify all of the claims above with other sources as much borrows heavily from that API paper--remember, this is an opinion piece--but the author states that Bronner is living high on public pension money and this should be raising red flags to many in the Alabaman state legislature.

# 3. An Even Closer-er Look at 55 Water Street: 1993

One of the biggest things that drove me to add to this Part 2--despite, sad face, not many reading the first post--was that in searching for info on 55 Water St, I came across a NYT article reporting on the 1993 deal for the new building in the NYT. I will add that when I can find it again, but the article hyperlinked to a part of 55 Water Street’s webpage that had no info (but was supposed to reference the 1993 deal). It was definitely full-on Streisand effect, why can’t I find anything about 55 Water Street and 1993, when it moved into this giant new building?I can’t say the hyperlink issue is necessarily nefarious. To quote dlauer, don’t attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity. I remember I had another semi-recent post (*Any apes got historical Volkswagon short squeeze footage?* :[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mny2vo/any\_apes\_got\_historical\_volkswagen\_short\_squeeze/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mny2vo/any_apes_got_historical_volkswagen_short_squeeze/))asking for videos of the VW squeeze and found few existed. I posted that CNBC has 3 dead links that had non-working videos about the squeeze, but it could attributed more to server laziness and the like than nefarious reasons.

Anywho, I kept digging for more about that 1993 deal. And found something juicy.

So remember this quote from earlier in this post?

>Harold McGraw III (of McGraw-Hill, as in USA school textbooks) finalized the deal with Bronner for 15 floors over 20 years. The owner was New Street Corp, an affiliate of RSA. This all sounds like a boring deal. The article mentions that the property was given up by Olympia & York Properties, a Canadian development company headed by the Reichmann family in Toronto, **to its creditor-bondholders in the early 90s.** From that time, vacancies went from 40% to 2%.  
>  
>**The vacancy rate climbed as high as 40 percent -- about 1.5 million square feet in 1993 -- with move-outs by big investment firms. Olympia & York, no longer in a position to get the financing to carry out the asbestos removal and other major improvement work necessary to attract or hold major tenants, relinquished the ownership to its bondholder-creditors. The largest one, the Retirement Systems of Alabama, bought out the other bondholders.**

Polite. Almost, *too* polite. Don’t worry, fellow apes, if you were hoping for more fuckery than do I have the story for you.

In 2019, Casey Tooner wrote an article. (Ok, cool?)

The admittedly fun title? “When the RSA bought a skyscraper, smashed the mob, and launched an empire.”

Asbestos? No no no dear ape. The secret ingredient isn’t asbestos; in 1993, it really was crime.

I mean, this is really a crazy story. **Tooner writes that 55 Water Street was purchased for a fraction of its worth** in part due to Harry Bridgewood, an undercover NYC cop who co-owned a sporting goods store with 2 other cops and shared an orange juice delivery route. This undercover cop ended up going, well, undercover under the name Paul Vasil while wearing a wire, and “would coordinate bribes and rig bids with V. Ponte & Sons.”

**Former NYC District Attorney Robert Morgenthau helped lead Bridgewood as part of these stings. Another fun fact? “Morgenthau has deep Alabama ties and had previously collaborated in the past with Bronner, who signed off on the project.”**

&#x200B;

**So in 1992, there was a takeover by Bronner and Co. after former owners defaulted on $538 million worth of loans. RSA was the largest holder of the loans at $100 million worth, and bought the rest for 29 cents on the dollar.**

**55 Water Street was mentioned as being a building “in desperate need of repair and beholden to a number of criminal forces**.” One of the largest criminal forces there was a garbage collection firm that had contracted there for over 20 years. **That firm had major connections to the Gambino and Genovese crime families, the Italian mobs that were a big part of NYC’s crime underbelly.**There were definitely some interesting facts to this story: “**Bronner recalled a tiny flower garden in the building that one man was paid $50,000 a year to water.** There was also a ghost payroll scheme where 15 union members were charging the building for the work of two non-union immigrants.”

So how does this relate to the purchase of 55 Water?Morgenthau buys Bridgewood a suit, he goes undercover as Vassil, says was there was as the new owner to renovate the building. This meant rebidding service contracts, which then drove the mob out. They were then able to catch them in the act of bribing:

>Bridgwood met with Vincent Ponte, the son of Angelo Ponte, the former head of what once was New York's largest garbage-hauling company. During their meetings, Ponte slipped Bridgwood two envelopes containing $5,000 worth of cash to keep the contract with the skyscraper, and later to see the bids at the last minute so that his firm could undercut them. Then, the police swooped in. A total of 34 people, 34 companies, and four trade waste associations were indicted as part of the five-year investigation...Interestingly, Morgenthau noted that it "took the Retirement Systems of Alabama to stand up and do the right thing."

After the investigation, Bridgwood was kept on, and “In his permanent role, Bridgwood helped attract big name tenants such Standards and Poor's, the NYC Department of Transportation, and communications firm Bowne & Co.”

Reiterating the importance of this deal, Tooner notes the following:

>“Millions of dollars of proceeds from the skyscraper flood into the RSA coffers annually. Perhaps more importantly, the building's success gave them a seat at the table for bigger business deals to come. It cleared the path for future RSA investments ...  **"It's definitely the best investment the Retirement Systems of Alabama in its history has ever made," said Marc Reynolds, a longtime RSA deputy director who was fired from the RSA in 2012. "It was like someone going to the dog track and winning big money and you're hooked and you think it can do it every time."**

Once again, it begs the question:

**TL;DR:**

* **RSA, which owns 55 Water Street where the DTCC is located, and David Bronner have been criticized for failing to include an independent fiduciary counsel for RSA.**
* **Alabama Policy Institute argues that RSA has been losing money for pensioners; this echoes calls by many saying that Bronner is making money and investments (golf courses, hotels) off public money.**
* **55 Water Street was purchased in part due to a buyout, but largely as a result of a sting operation against the NYC Italian mob. NYC's then District Attorney Morganthou had links to Alabama.**
