<p>Was just spending some quality Sunday reading time browsing through Fintel reports... as you do... and I came across some shit that may mean nothing, but may be worth putting some collective brain power into. </p>
<p>Let's start with $HYG</p>
<p>When Kenny sent in his 13F-HR in Feb, he has $0 worth of shares of this ETF. Date: 16 Feb 2021</p>
<p>His latest filing shows that he as added to this ETF to his portfolio, but only $43 million worth of shares. </p>
<p>More interestingly though, as we know Kenny loves to short shit, is that he also owns $650 million calls and $2.5 billion worth of puts. </p>
<p>This is no small amount even for Kenny. </p>
<p>So... let's take a look at Citadel overall. </p>
<p>His latest filling shows that he currently has $407 billion AUM. </p>
<p>He has 13,104 positions
Has been closing a lot of positions since his last filing with 1048 closed. (Someone need some capital?)</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>He's only opened 5 new positions. </p>
<p>So after the Jan ðŸ˜¨ for him, he no doubt has been trying to take a step back, reposition himself in order "To continue to fight, to stay alive for 1 more day at a time"</p>
<p>So what has he decided are the most critical positions for him to be in that he previously did not have?</p>
<p>So the 5 new positions that Kenny has been buying up, are mainly bonds...</p>
<p>Teradyne Inc Bond (US:880770AG7)
Insulet Corp Bond (US:45784PAH4)
Teladoc Health Inc Bond (US:87918AAC9)
CONV. NOTE (US:98954MAG6)</p>
<p>And 1 stock:</p>
<p>Sea Ltd (KY:81141RAD2)</p>
<p>And we know from the $HYG example, that he is also adding to existing Bond positions. </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>No fucking clue - I like drawing triangles on charts with crayons and didn't pay attention in school so don't understand fundamentals of business, not amind how a hedge fund positions themselves across multiple businesses/securities</p>
<ul>
<li>But let's look at what else is going on here from the FREE version of Fintel. (I refuse to pay for the premium version, as if I had any money, I'd be buying GME with it)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok... </p>
<p>So Citadels main positions and the positions it is mostly known for are:</p>
<p>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (US:SPY)
Tesla Motors, Inc. (US:TSLA) (Wink wink Michael Burry)
Amazon.com, Inc. (US:AMZN)</p>
<p>Ok no surprises here really, except the Burry short position on Tesla (Genius), I wonder if he has a short on Amazon?</p>
<p>All mainstream positions</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Let's look at the main industries that Kenny has positioned himself in?</p>
<p>Fishing hunting and trapping (4lolz: He needs this to learn how to avoid being hunted by Apes)</p>
<p>Legal Services (4lolz: He def gonna need this when the hunt is over)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Repair Services (4lolz: Needs this to try keep himself alive longer)</p>
<p>Ok so, lols aside. This is a little more unusual. What is the significance of these seemingly random industries for Kenny to be involved in? </p>
<p>Fair enough legal, that's kinda mainstream, but hunting and trapping?</p>
<p>What does this all mean?</p>
<p>Haven't a clue...</p>
<p>This is all I can determine from the FREE version of Fintel. </p>
<p>Does anyone that has the paid version, and a few wrinkles have more information ðŸ¤”?</p>
<p>What does the move to bonds mean ðŸ¤”?</p>
<p>Why is his closing position ration 250/1 ðŸ¤”?</p>
<p>This sadly is as far as my smooth brain can go... I leave this in the hands of those who are better Apes than Me.</p>
<p>Is this a journey worth continuing down?</p>
<p>IMO, I think understanding how a trapped rat reacts to the environment it finds itself in, is worth understanding if you wish to trap that rat. </p>
<p>TLDR: Kenny's a trapped rat</p>
