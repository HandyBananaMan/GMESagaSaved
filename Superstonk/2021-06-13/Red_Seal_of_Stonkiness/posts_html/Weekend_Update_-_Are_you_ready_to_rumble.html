<p>This is a very short update but I have a number of items to cover before market open.</p>
<h1>Welcome Satori Team as Moderators</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/htrg11qn55571.jpg?width=630&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df4cdd9ced0faafdb1d70723713e3590447dcd4f">(plot twist: they are actually IRL androids...)</a></p>
<p>Not many of you know the true history behind Satori and how it became so intertwined with the mod team. The truth is they've been working with me since before the r/Superstonk migration. These members include u/catto_del_fatto, u/grungromp, and u/Captain-Fan. They have worked meticulously and tirelessly to progress the Satori project from idea to manifest guardian ape-gel of Superstonk.</p>
<p>Awhile ago, we added u/catto_del_fatto and he was able to study the sub from a moderator perspective. He has earned our trust and since then has been promoted to general mod permissions. As a result, the Satori team quickly became linked to the mod team, as they became more and more critical to the sub's makeup.</p>
<p>In the past few months, in addition to Satori, they have helped us identify FUD attacks, organize mod mail, and identify bad actors and true apes alike. I would be wrong to suggest they aren't already a critical aspect of our moderating practice, and therefore we mods voted with overwhelming support to do the next logical step: add them as moderators.</p>
<p><strong>Please join the mod team in welcoming</strong> u/grungromp <strong>and</strong> u/Captain-Fan <strong>to the moderator team.</strong> I have no doubt they will continue to bring incredible concepts to life, with more accuracy and reliability, as mods themselves. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Also, now they can't escape *maniacal laughter**cough-cough*</p>
<h1>Satori Approvals</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zg5j1yh465571.jpg?width=1332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6329324faa295c425e8975b0aec1e59b1821e9f">SATORI DIRECTIVE: PR073CC 4P3</a></p>
<p>For those unaware, Satori is a sophisticated program that we utilize as a subreddit to identify "true apes" and also "bad actors" or people who would otherwise spread FUD and harassing posts. As a result of this software, we have been able to introduce an approval process that adds members to the Approved Users list. These approved users can bypass the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/automod_info">karma and age limits imposed by automod</a>.</p>
<p>We realize there is some confusion about Satori, and we are working on clearing this up in a more reliable way. I just created a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/satori">wiki page for Satori</a> and while it is currently <strong>under construction</strong> you can check back there for updates on the system. This should help us streamline any questions and information, just as we do with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/superstonkbot">SuperstonkBot</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can check out u/grungromp's post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nva7nh/satori_the_one_week_security_update_important/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"><strong>Satori: The One Week Security Update (Important Information Inside)</strong></a>, for a more recent update. The most critical aspect of this post is the new <strong>!apeprove!</strong> comment function, which means that any user, inside karma/age limits or not, can comment <strong>!apeprove!</strong> on any r/Superstonk post and be bumped to the top of the list. If your comment is immediately removed, I am told it will still work!</p>
<p>We have some limits imposed by Reddit, so the approvals are done in waves so as to work within this limits and Reddit policy. This <strong>!apeprove!</strong> function allows active users to essentially cut line. Make sure you use it! Spam will not be tolerated, though. Patience is key.</p>
<h1>We... Us... "The Movement"... What is this?</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/jcufgqqb75571.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06768c4ac97561f9d1e02d46c39aaf6dd120412b">We just apes.</a></p>
<p>Okay, listen. We must follow Reddit policy, or they might take the sub down. We must follow actual laws, too, because god-forbid they do something evil like delist GameStop or implicate apes legally, as they did u/deepfuckingvalue. So, I am going to have to be a bit stern here and amplify a few things that I really think I need to amplify:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please view the DISCLAIMER associated with the subreddit. You can access it by going to r/Superstonk and (on Desktop) looking at the side bar, and (on Mobile) under the About menu.</li>
<li>We do not manipulate the market. We do not coordinate anything regarding the stock market. We do not urge people to buy or sell, or do anything with what is their privately owned  stock. We do not shame people for their choices as retail investors, in an attempt to get them to hold when they don't want to, or to buy GME when they'd rather buy something else. We let retail investors make their own individual decisions. That's sub policy.</li>
<li>We do not organize or attempt to push political action, or spark Occupy Wall Street 2.0 or whatever some of you think this is. We are not going to organize letters to the SEC or otherwise enter ourselves into a political arena that we, trust me, do not want to enter. We are a bunch of apes who are bananas for GameStop and that's about it.</li>
<li>We are here to share information, build a community, and express ourselves regarding GameStop as not just a stock, but also as a company, in way that is not pressuring or purposefully influential, and is based on fundamentals as well as market realities. If you don't want to talk about GameStop, there are plenty of other subs to go to, and, if you talk about GameStop, make sure you follow the rules and guidelines of the sub.</li>
<li>TL;DR: We like the stock. We love the company. We are apes. That's about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please also keep in mind that r/Superstonk was once a small little sub of just under 300 people before it exploded due to the Second Great Ape Migration. After that time, we got quite used to being the unknown sub that everyone needed to know. Well, we kept growing...</p>
<p>We know that big news stations, personalities and influencers, and likely GameStop themselves all keep track of us, so know that when you post content, it will be seen by people who might be writing negative-slant articles, or who might get on TV and talk negatively about us. I am not going to censor you or limit you, as this community will be as self-aware as it can be, I guess. I am suggesting that you maybe consider how your post or comment will bring unwanted attention or scrutiny to the sub.</p>
<p>No, I am not asking you to tone it down or "behave" for the big shots. Not at all. Have you seen my Twitter? Please. I am just reminding you of where we are. We aren't that little sub anymore. We have more online members than r/wallstreetbets these days. We are rising fast. Let's just be mindful of what negatives that can bring, if the right apes say the wrong things. I know you are all smooth brains but maybe, if you can spare adding a wrinkle, add one in this regard.</p>
<h1>Superstonk Live: Monkey Business (stay tuned...)</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/oukctkmx65571.png?width=4001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae7e8fa5859aea36119d68aad01c987b900b15d">Created by apes, about apes, for apes.</a></p>
<p>The mods are currently trying to put together a Monkey Business for the end of this week. The exact date is still in flux, but please comment below if you want to be considered as a participant in these panel-centric live streams, and an organizing mod may reach out to you. You do not need to be on camera, but you WILL need to be an active community member.</p>
<p>We have only done one episode of Monkey Business and <a href="https://youtu.be/UDKC_oXqhGM">you can watch it here</a>.</p>
<p>Please do NOT contact us directly, and trust that we will reference this post, or select them on our own accord based on behavior and interaction with the community.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for a post about specifics, or you can subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Superstonk">https://www.youtube.com/Superstonk</a> and watch for the stream.</p>
<h1>Superstonk Awards Design Contest (stay tuned...)</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/go1bb632f5571.jpg?width=633&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a92abb86f8b1ff6bb06825457ff516eef113bf">I am giggling right now as I insert this photo. HE IS SO CUTE.</a></p>
<p>I will be personally handling this contest and I am very excited because I actually do some pro designs IRL. Therefore, I feel I can be very strict and specific about all of the details *evil laughter* *cough* ahem.</p>
<p>We are going to be hosting a design contest to generate some Community Awards. You can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/">learn more about these awards here</a>, but there will be a post early next week (or tomorrow) with all details and submission requirements.</p>
<p>I can say currently that we will be using the bracket system that we used for the Banner Contest, and it will be a bit more streamlined and, well, faster. You will be submitting via email, so please create an anonymous email if you have not already, unless you don't care; I won't reveal anything either way, other than the design, name of award, and author by Reddit username. Also, the top eight will be receiving prizes, and ALL will receive mod-awards that give Premium membership. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p><em>I honestly had hoped to make this post yesterday, but since I was feeling under the weather due to my second COVID-19 shot, there's a slight delay. Apologies! I am giving the other mods time to look at my details and give me feedback before I post, but I wanted to let you all know it's coming.</em></p>
<h1>Onward to Market Open</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2oddk4y585571.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0fb40f1881f57d39f76fedbc348471fd290f129">Make sure you drink lots of water!!! (or mead\/ale)</a></p>
<p>I also want to say real quick that the only thing we're pumping right now is my excitement and love for this community and the incredible mod team that I am so very lucky to have at my side. Never, ever, in a billion years, did I ever think r/Superstonk was going to reach these numbers (over 430,000) or beat r/wallstreetbets with online users. I mean, I joked about it, like "Superstonk will be the next big thing! You just wait! I'll show you!" but really I'm so smooth-brain it hurts so I never expected it for real.</p>
<p>My joke/dream was that I wanted to hear Fox News anchors say "Superstonk" out loud on national TV, and right now I can't even be sure they haven't already. This is truly remarkable and IMPRESSIVE. To the mods and the entire community, thank you for being the shit a.k.a. the bee's knees a.k.a. diamond-handed lunar apes a.k.a. the kickass OG badasses of reddit. Thank you for being here and making r/Superstonk the <em>best sub on reddit</em>. I am truly and eternally grateful.</p>
<p>I am actually REALLY excited for market open and I have a gut feeling that we're going to see some crazy price action this week. Remember, trust DD over Red's gut... please... Just remember, a lot of what we're seeing is intended to discourage GME holders. If you like the stock, feel free to HODL it as long as you like. I personally will be. Let's go! 🚀</p>
