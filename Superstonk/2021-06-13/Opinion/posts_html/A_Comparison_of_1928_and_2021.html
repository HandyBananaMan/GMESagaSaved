<p>It's not any one thing... but all put together... imho Burry is right. Again.</p>
<p>Comparing warning signs from 1928 and now, this is a summary of what I've researched on the topic.</p>
<p>Just thought I'd share my notes in case any apes are interested;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Delusions of Grandeur</strong></p>
<p>1928: The average American citizen believes they can and ought to become a millionaire simply due to the fact that they are a participant in the American economy.</p>
<p>2021: The average American CEO believes they can and ought to become a billionaire simply due to the fact that they are a participant in the American economy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Industry Falling Behind</strong></p>
<p>1928: Industry is having trouble keeping up with rapid stock market growth.</p>
<p>2021: Industry is having trouble keeping up with rapid stock market growth and struggling to recover from a pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Attempts at Democratization</strong></p>
<p>1928: There is a reinforcing trend of retail investors democratizing the stock market as new individual investors keep piling in.</p>
<p>2021: There is a reinforcing trend of retail investors democratizing the stock market as new individual investors keep piling in, which is exasperated exponentially thanks to social media.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>"No Risk" Loans</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Most investors, big and small, are over-leveraged after using loans to buy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>International Trade Restrictions Stack Up</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: International trade is quietly - and sometimes loudly - becoming more restricted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Banks Begin to Strongarm Large Borrowers</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Banks everywhere are starting to call in big loans.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The Mother of All Bubbles</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: There is a massive, unprecedented stock market bubble with little to no regulation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Wages At All-Time Low</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: People are getting paid less for regular jobs than ever before.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Cultists</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Corporate overlords expect to be treated like cult leaders.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Fair Share Considered 'Bullshit'</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Asset Hoarding</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: The highest valued stocks are unevenly distributed. There are too many hoarders keeping huge amounts of high-value assets off market, causing smaller investments in the same asset to deflate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Domestic Lenders Overlooked</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Domestic investors are hurting from the the real cost of credit while the big firms play their games.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Self-Regulation Becomes Non-Fiction</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Financial leaders attest they are 100% ethical and act above criticism, even from government officials. Top bankers' worst fear is any new regulation coming in, since even a little restriction of illegal practices would destabilize their portfolios. Bankers want regulation for regular investors but not for themselves, but they can't have it both ways no matter how hard they try, which is making them increasingly frustrated and angry.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Risky Lending IS The Economy Now</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Economic stability is precariously dependant on lots and lots of international and domestic lending.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Bank Customers Unknowingly Defrauded</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Rehypothecation is so prevelant even small private bankers are doing it. No law prevents banks from purchasing risky investments with their customers' deposits. Customers are completely unaware of this practice.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Super-Rich Obssessed with Hiding Their Money</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Asset bases are being actively hidden away using increasinly complicated maneuvers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Becoming Impossible to Call Popular Assets Junk</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Low-value assets are being held at artificially high evaluations. They can no longer be accurately appraised safely.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>No Cop on the Beat</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Those who are responsible for monitoring and enforcement are asleep at the wheel, non-existent, or worse, they are complicit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Blame Game Warming Up</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: The most publicly-known top investors and bankers are scared of being blamed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Barbarians at the Gate</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Elitists are absolutely terrified of ordinary people becoming rich, which is starting to happen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Corrupt Lawmakers</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: There is plenty of evidence to show regulators have a personal interest in the illegal schemes going on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The Exclusive Club of Elitists Shrinks Ever Smaller</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Conflict of interest and nepotism are rampant and brazen at the highest levels of the financial industry. Authority is consolidated and owners/top executives start to collect job titles, government roles, and director board seats like they are playing cards.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>False Collateral Starts to Spill Out into the Open</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Fraudulent collateral being used frequently by the richest people in the world, and the only reason anyone knows about it is because they are trying to use amounts that are too high to hide.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Rumours of Failings</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Banks are starting to fail around the globe. Massive losses being reported.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Bad News Sounds Impossible</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Pessimistic predictions are being dismissed and ignored.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>False Assumptions About Stock Values</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Most stocks are not actually overpriced - the bubble is being caused by other factors - but the public assumption, fueled by the media, is that most stocks are too expensive.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Mass Media Owned by Wall Street</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: The news is only reporting what their Wall Street owners want the public to know. Misinformation is spreading quickly thanks to the false mainstrem media narrative and accelerating the crisis at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>No More Cheap Fed Fun Bucks</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Cheap credit from the Fed seems to be finally coming to an end. The Fed is trying to make borrowing slowly more expensive so interest rates don't suddenly go through the roof overnight.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>"Experts" Are Saying the Bubble Will Never End</strong></p>
<p>1928/Now: Ideas on a "new economy" have emerged, claiming that the current market bubble will never burst, inflation is just a bad dream, and the rich will keep getting exponentially richer forever. It's not just dumbass water cooler talk now; books are being published, speeches are being given, and the government is making official announcements claiming the same.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>HEY SO WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL CATALYST THAT STARTED THE CRASH IN 1929 ANYWAYS?</em></p>
<p>Obviously there were a lot of trigger points, but it was actually the London Stock Exchange that fell first. The NYSE crashed after.</p>
<p>For a few months before the crash of 1929, even in late 1928, it seemed like everything was going to be ok. The US economy appeared to be recovering. There were optimists everywhere and they were completely drowning out the pessimists.</p>
<p>Then the Hatry Group, led by Clarence Hatry, were <strong>caught using fraudulent collateral</strong>. A lot of fraudulent collateral. Like, a LOT.</p>
<p>That's all it took. The first big domino.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again these are just my notes, nothing that hasn't been said already, only my own composite of info regarding past indicators.</p>
