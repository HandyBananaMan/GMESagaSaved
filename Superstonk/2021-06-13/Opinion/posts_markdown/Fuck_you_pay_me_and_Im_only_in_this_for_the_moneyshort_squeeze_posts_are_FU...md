Dear Apes,

&#x200B;

Your buddy the dumb crayon eating Marine here.   Let me explain what I think is going on.   ***Edit: If you think I'm attempting to divide the sub.  I'm not.   I'm trying to keep illegal practices from happening on our fucking sub, ya know, so we still have a sub tomorrow and the next day.  Take this forward while reading this.  I don't care why you are investing in GameStop.  Just don't voice it publicly.   Come on people, read between the lines.  What's the first rule of fight club.....use your heads... ðŸ˜†   ***

**We just saw an former SEC Director on the news at the end of the week speaking about how there is no way to pin what is going on here on retail; wait for it.......EXCEPT if GME/ other Meme stocks are just a "Pump and Dump".   Now all of a sudden this weekend, I keep running into posts with the same underlying message.**

# "Fuck you, I'm only here for quick money.  I don't care about GameStops fundamentals, I'm here for the quick money.  Aka :  Pump and Dump."

# Let me break something down for you all, GME had excellent 1st quarter numbers.   We have a dream team of Executives from Amazon/Chewy and they are pivoting into E-Commerce.  There should be ZERO fucking Apes screaming, I'm just here for the squeeze and I don't care about what GameStop is doing.   NOBODY SHOULD BE SAYING I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE STOCK, FUCK YOU PAY ME.  It doesn't make sense, and it's feeding the narrative that the SEC would look at.

You know this sub is being watched like hawks.   Why the fuck would you rock to boat to just see how far you can go before tipping it over.   We are winning if we don't shoot ourselves in the foot.  It reminds me of Oberyn Martell and The Mountain.   If Oberyn just kept his mouth shut and kept his safe distance, he would have won......DO NOT LET THE MOUNTAIN SQUISH OUR FUCKING HEADS IN.

If you are guilty of saying shit like this or have upvoted it, go back and change it.  This shit is FUD.  It's trying to get people on this sub  to say say things that can be construed as market manipulation.  They know this is a Hive Mind, if you plant enough seeds, shit will spread.   This is their latest FUD.  They are trying to find a way to make retail the bad guys and you guys are spreading it.

&#x200B;

Knock this shit off.  The SEC and the big guys are waiting to have a reason to shut this all down.  You all are here because you like the stock and think GameStop has a bright future.   If this does MOASS and you take profits that's fine, that's what a normal long investor would do.  Nobody here thinks any differently.

(Edit:  Apes seem to not understand the seriousness of what this message says.   The entire sub and investors can have the GME trade shutdown over this.  If they can clearly say that "Apes" are just trying to pump these stocks for a quick ride that is ILLEGAL.  For fucks sake people, just don't say anything about your position.  How hard is that?  Apparently some of you aren't able to to read between the lines. Repeat after me, I just like DFV.  We just like the stock.    )


This Ape nailed today.  I do find the humor and irony of my posting but I felt it had to be said.  This meme sums today up
