Seriously, would some of you please remove the stick up your asses and replace it with soft, pleasure-inducing bananas? I have the utmost respect for the honorable Knights of New and the like of such brave battlefront orangutans, but for the love of DFV, please chill out with the fud-accusations and forum-sliding-cries. The mayo period was funny as hell, and these Kenny pareidolia posts are even better. Also people who bashed the mods for producing a hilariously chaotic and apelike livestream on 6/9 (nice), calm down. It is all part of ape culture and ancient ritual. Never in my six months of investing have I seen such a beautiful community mixing smooth-brained humor with wrinkle-brained knowledge. Ape don’t fight ape. End of rant.

Edit: omg this blew up, 14 upcrayons and an award, love you apes ❤️🦍💎🙌🏽🚀

Edit 2: Thanks for the awardS. And yes, as many apes have pointed out already, just use the sort by flair or filter out smooth-brain flairs, retards ❤️
