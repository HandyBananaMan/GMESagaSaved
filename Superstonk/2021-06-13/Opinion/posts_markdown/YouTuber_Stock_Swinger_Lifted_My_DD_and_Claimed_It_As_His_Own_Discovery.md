He even lifted my option chain screensgrabs. You can tell by looking at the URL of the June 11 and June 18 option chains images in his video. He even mischaracterized my DD because it wasn't just Blackrock and Citadel that loaded up on $HYG Puts.

Here's my DD from 8 days ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ns7k6q/could\_gamestops\_liftoff\_unravel\_corporate\_junk/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ns7k6q/could_gamestops_liftoff_unravel_corporate_junk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Anyway, not cool. Not cool at all man.

Edit #1: Wow everyone ... I stepped out for a few hours to grab brunch with the family, and come back to find this. Thanks for having my back, everyone! What a true shrewdness we have here on r/Superstonk!

When I first saw this guy's video I thought, oh cool. But then I thought, I better leave a comment so everyone knows the source of this, and also because there is a bit more to the story and data than what he was presenting. But when he deleted that comment, and another, and another, that's when I felt what he was doing wasn't a harmless oversight, but deliberate theft, and I felt compelled to surface the situation here. Glad I did. This community truly is the best!

I've tried to upvote and respond to as much as I can, but the response has been overwhelming.

...............................

For my next DD, I'm working on something I hope everyone will appreciate. We all know the 55MM proxy votes reported by GME's wasn't the half of it (or maybe even the 1/10th of it). I have a bit of a background in consumer research, so I decided to use that knowledge and some of the same tools to put together and conduct a very simple single question survey using a third-party consumer research platform. I've been serving the question up to a randomized set of 300 U.S.-based adults over the past few days (don't worry, this surveying is totally anonymous, totally disconnected from Reddit and this community, and is being managed programmatically). Ideally I'd want something like 1,500-3,500 samples for something like this, but even with my eventual sample size of 300, the margin of error is going to be sub-6%.

I'm including this here because I've posted on this a few times over the last few days as the results come in, and everything has been downvoted something awful. I just have to believe this community would not only be interested in such research, but I also feel this community deserves some hard data around this question of share ownership.

I'm presenting the results in progress below, but I want to stress a few points:

• 300 sample size provides some solid insights, but the ideal sample size would be 1K or more (although once past 500-600, the margin of error doesn't move much)

• Capping the highest response buckets at 101 shares owned ensures an underestimation (this is deliberate ... I'd rather err on the side of showing the tip of an iceberg with high confidence than show the whole iceberg with low confidence)

• As you can see in the Bias Tables, the 55-64 age group is over-represented, and the 25-34 age group is underrepresented. This wasn't intentional like the question/answer structure, but I'm this particular bias is resulting in a more conservative results versus more representative sample ... in other words, I bet a lot more 25-34 year old own $GME than 55-64 year olds.

• I am not done ... once I have the full 300 response, I will share with the community my tool, methodology, and costs. What I'm using is pretty inexpensive and accessible to everyone. If anyone else is interested in generating their own data set (both to validate mine and to hopefully add to mine to bolster the sample size), that would be great!

• Before anyone starts to crap all over what I am doing here, please be prepared to present your better idea for building some reliable datasets around GE ownership. As far as I can tell, this is the bet and only attempt at gather third-party, unbiased data around U.S-based $GME ownership

Here's the data I've collected so far:

Again, I am still collecting another 79 samples to get to 300. But as things stand (mind this is still a pretty small sample with an margin of error of \~6-7%), this data seem to suggest GME ownership among U.S. adult population is 5.9% with an average of 28.15 shares. There are 209MM adults in the U.S., so based purely on this limited data set, it looks like U.S. retail investors could own a minimum of 347MM shares. Remember, I capped ownership at 101 shares to be ULTRA conservative, so the number could be much higher. In other words, the two individuals who checked "101 shares or more" could have thousands or tens of thousands of shares, and those wouldn't at all be accounted for. This is very intentional. I'm trying to show that even the tip of the iceberg far exceeds the total number of outstanding shares, and I think this data does this pretty convincingly at this point.

Add to this individual foreign investors, insiders, RC Ventures, institutional, etc. and it's very clear there are a metric fuck ton of synthetic/fraudulent (or whatever you want to call  them) shares floating around. We all already knew this, I'm just trying to build something to define this with unbiased data and hard numbers.

If you're interested in this research, please follow me and keep an eye out for this new DD.

Edit #2: Since comments are closed, if the DD idea outlined above is something you support, please visit this older posts about this and let me know (the initial reception of the idea was pretty bad, and you can see by the 0 Upvote count):
