OMG!??!? The company made up of members participants has member participants on it's board.

THIS IS AN OUTRAGE HOW DARE THEY!!! 

No, this is literally how the DTCC is founded. 
Most of the board of directors are board members of other banks and hedge firms.

This is like being angry that the NFL is owned and operated by the guys that own the teams.


The next one? 

Warren buffett owns xxxxx shares of GME!!! Omg!?!??

How did they get that number? Berkshire has an 8% stake in a company that owns gme.

That's not how any of this fucking works!!!!!

If you collected 756,000 shares of GME (roughly 1% of the company's shares) you are not entitled to 1% of what's in your local game stop. 

Stop up voting this shit, it smells like a shill campaign to discredit this group.

You karma farmers that are pushing this shit, fucking stop.

You fuckers just mindlessly up voting mis-information. This shit takes like 5 minuets to figure out. 

Y'all, we are each other's brothers and sisters. 
As your ape kin, I'm telling you to do better.

We are gonna get paid, all we gonna do is hodl.
The system might not even get fixed after this shit.

But we can worry about that AFTER WE GET PAID. we are here about making money.

This community is here to make fucking money. 

Once we have money we can change the fucking world with it. But first we are here to get paid.

Edit: auto correct got me.

And down vote all you want it ain't changing the truth.
