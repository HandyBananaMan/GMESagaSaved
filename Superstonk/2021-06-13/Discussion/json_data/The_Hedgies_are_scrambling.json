    "selftext": "My post has been deemed as FUD. So rather than leave the post up, I've decided the right thing to do is to delete the post outright. I've learned the hard way that having opinions that challenge the herd mentality is unwelcome. I believed that the experience I had trading derivatives for an investment bank would provide some valuable counterparty insight, but clearly, I was wrong.\n\nI'll also be leaving the sub and clearing my account of all GME/AMC related content. I've always welcomed thoughtful debate and the warmth of this community, but after receiving multiple insults, death threats, and being told to kill myself, I now see that this community has changed into something reckless and dangerous that I no longer wish to be a part of. \n\nBest of luck to you all. I sincerely hope you all receive the life-changing money that you're hoping for.",
