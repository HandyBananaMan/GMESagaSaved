<p>OMG!??!? The company made up of members participants has member participants on it's board.</p>
<p>THIS IS AN OUTRAGE HOW DARE THEY!!! </p>
<p>No, this is literally how the DTCC is founded. 
Most of the board of directors are board members of other banks and hedge firms.</p>
<p>This is like being angry that the NFL is owned and operated by the guys that own the teams.</p>
<p>The next one? </p>
<p>Warren buffett owns xxxxx shares of GME!!! Omg!?!??</p>
<p>How did they get that number? Berkshire has an 8% stake in a company that owns gme.</p>
<p>That's not how any of this fucking works!!!!!</p>
<p>If you collected 756,000 shares of GME (roughly 1% of the company's shares) you are not entitled to 1% of what's in your local game stop. </p>
<p>Stop up voting this shit, it smells like a shill campaign to discredit this group.</p>
<p>You karma farmers that are pushing this shit, fucking stop.</p>
<p>You fuckers just mindlessly up voting mis-information. This shit takes like 5 minuets to figure out. </p>
<p>Y'all, we are each other's brothers and sisters. 
As your ape kin, I'm telling you to do better.</p>
<p>We are gonna get paid, all we gonna do is hodl.
The system might not even get fixed after this shit.</p>
<p>But we can worry about that AFTER WE GET PAID. we are here about making money.</p>
<p>This community is here to make fucking money. </p>
<p>Once we have money we can change the fucking world with it. But first we are here to get paid.</p>
<p>Edit: auto correct got me.</p>
<p>And down vote all you want it ain't changing the truth.</p>
