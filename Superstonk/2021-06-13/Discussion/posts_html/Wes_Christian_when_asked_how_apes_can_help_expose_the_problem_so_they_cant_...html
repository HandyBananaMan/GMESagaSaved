<p>Here is a template letter you can use. Feel free to modify it , edit it, even comment a better version of it please. I typed this up on phone just trying to help.  </p>

<p>Dear <strong><em>_</em></strong>_,</p>
<p>Naked short selling was made illegal following the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Did you know that entities designated as market makers(MMs) / authorized participants(APs) have been given special powers of creation and redemption on ETFs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX7fOx5G40A&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be)  for “liquidity purposes”( https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2020/34-89088.pdf) which has led to a loophole [read as:feature] allowing illicit parties to continue to create illegal naked short positions? Additionally, by using strategic (also illegal) option strategies, they are able to hide these naked short positions. (https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-151) </p>
<p>The MMs and APs choosing to abuse this power are able to use ETFs to operationally short and bankrupt target companies for tax free returns. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncq35zrFCAg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be)</p>
<p>Two amazing interviews with Texas attorney Wes Christian, who has been fighting to expose this for two decades, detail further the theft this has equated to. (An estimated multi-trillion dollar problem).</p>

<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q8-JO3g5bm4</p>
<p>The ownership and control between the self regulating entities involved also reflect a direct conflict of interest.</p>
<p>This is a systemic issue that I would really like to spread awareness on and would like to hear your stance on any plans, current or future, to help expose what Wes Christian refers to as, Terrorism on American Capitalism.  </p>
<p>Thank you and sincere, </p>

<p>Here are ways to contact your congressmen and senators. </p>
<p>Not American? Apes of the world, feel free to write them as concerned investors yourself - I see no pre-requisite that you need to live here to shoot them an email - or to even state where you live in the email - if I’m wrong, somebody please correct me so I can not spread false information. </p>

<p>How to find your congressmen: https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative</p>
<p>The congressman name should take you to their website with a contact us form or might have an email address listed. </p>
<p>How to find your senators: https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm</p>
<p>How to contact your senators after you find them if they don’t have email address listed: https://www.senate.gov/general/contacting.htm</p>
<p>For the record- the congressmen and senators aren’t going to do shit, but don’t let that phase you into not writing; what writing will do is just help spread awareness and show its a real issue with a lot more people involved then they currently think and that we are a lot more educated on the facts than they might currently be led to believe.</p>
<p>All you have to do is buy and hold. This is just if you’re bored since it’s the weekend.</p>
