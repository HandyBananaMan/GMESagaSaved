I know a lot of us are ridiculed by our family/peers that think we are just following a cult-like meme promising fake riches in a dying company.

The reality is we all know whatâ€™s really coming and put in the hours of research day after day.

Some of us put our life savings into this, some weekly paychecks, others every little penny scrounged up til they could just buy that one share. 

We do it because we have a conviction and belief based on sound judgement, hard facts, and scientific method by the many wrinkle brained among us.

So, when you finally cash those shares in and set a new course of history with the rest of us, remember you didnâ€™t get here by luck.

Luck didnâ€™t make you read hours and hours of posts and data. 

Luck didnâ€™t put all your hard earned money on the line.

Luck didnâ€™t make you hold out everytime the stock price crashed from hedge fuckery.

The only luck involved was discovering this community and accidentally pulling back the curtain to reveal the world with clear eyes.

Forget the haters and doubters.

Apes strong together.
 
It wasnâ€™t luck, but we are lucky.

Edit: thanks for all the love and awards friends. Glad I seem to have struck a positive chord with the community.  

I see it as an antI-FUD post. Sometimes we just need that reminder of what weâ€™ve done, what we are doing and what will soon be if we are successful.
