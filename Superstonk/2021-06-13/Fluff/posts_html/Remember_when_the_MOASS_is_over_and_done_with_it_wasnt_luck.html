<p>I know a lot of us are ridiculed by our family/peers that think we are just following a cult-like meme promising fake riches in a dying company.</p>
<p>The reality is we all know whatâ€™s really coming and put in the hours of research day after day.</p>
<p>Some of us put our life savings into this, some weekly paychecks, others every little penny scrounged up til they could just buy that one share. </p>
<p>We do it because we have a conviction and belief based on sound judgement, hard facts, and scientific method by the many wrinkle brained among us.</p>
<p>So, when you finally cash those shares in and set a new course of history with the rest of us, remember you didnâ€™t get here by luck.</p>
<p>Luck didnâ€™t make you read hours and hours of posts and data. </p>
<p>Luck didnâ€™t put all your hard earned money on the line.</p>
<p>Luck didnâ€™t make you hold out everytime the stock price crashed from hedge fuckery.</p>
<p>The only luck involved was discovering this community and accidentally pulling back the curtain to reveal the world with clear eyes.</p>
<p>Forget the haters and doubters.</p>
<p>Apes strong together.</p>
<p>It wasnâ€™t luck, but we are lucky.</p>

<p>Edit: thanks for all the love and awards friends. Glad I seem to have struck a positive chord with the community.  </p>
<p>I see it as an antI-FUD post. Sometimes we just need that reminder of what weâ€™ve done, what we are doing and what will soon be if we are successful.</p>
