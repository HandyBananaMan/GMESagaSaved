<p>Remember that tweet Cohen sent from a Gamestop right by SEC headquarters? I think it was a hint. Cohen was letting us know that he's doing this the right way.  </p>
<p>The citadel owned media has been pumping out story after story calling the illegal naked shorters victims and saying that Redditors are a hivemind who are manipulating the market. Anyone who has been here for two seconds knows this isn't true. We just think this stock has great long term promise and there is a lot of evidence of naked shorting and hidden shorting. It isn't illegal in any stretch of the word to invest on that.  </p>
<p>But what about your family? What about your neighbors? They don't know anything except what the news will say when this goes down. Cohen is talking to the SEC to do this right.  </p>
<p>Would we have loved an untrimmed vote count? Obviously. Do we want a crypto dividend rushed out? Many do.  </p>
<p>But think. What will happen if they convince the world that this is a predatory group that victimized legit investors?  </p>
<p>Ryan Cohen is making sure we get the money owed to us for believing in the company.</p>
