    "selftext": "If you check my post history, about February, dad called retail investors in GME \u201cdumb fucks\u201d. I told him about the share offering and the quarterly numbers being up. He asked when I was gonna sell and I informed him I bought 5 more at open that morning to get laughed at even harder than previously. Fuck everyone that doubts. I\u2019m with you guys until the end, LFG\n\nEdit- this blew up waaaay bigger than expected. Thank you for all the encouragement and awards. This WAS NOT \u201cshould I sell post.\u201d FUCK NO YOU DONT SELL NOW! HODL!!! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\n\nI just wanted to point out that FUD comes from all directions, family, coworkers, friends\u2026 \n\nMy dad is awesome and has always been there for me and helped me when needed. I love the guy, he\u2019s great. Just wanted to share something we could communicate on and both be hyped about. Everytime I bring it up, it\u2019s laughs and jokes. We\u2019ve never really connected on anything collectively.\n\nSometimes ppl don\u2019t realize until it\u2019s too late and things are said or jokes are made, he\u2019s getting that car that I always told him would be a HotWheels car. \n\nLove you all and LFG!!! Just no dancing \ud83d\udc83",
