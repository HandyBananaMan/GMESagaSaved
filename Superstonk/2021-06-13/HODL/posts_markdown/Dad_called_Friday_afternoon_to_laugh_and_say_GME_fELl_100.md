If you check my post history, about February, dad called retail investors in GME “dumb fucks”. I told him about the share offering and the quarterly numbers being up. He asked when I was gonna sell and I informed him I bought 5 more at open that morning to get laughed at even harder than previously. Fuck everyone that doubts. I’m with you guys until the end, LFG

Edit- this blew up waaaay bigger than expected. Thank you for all the encouragement and awards. This WAS NOT “should I sell post.” FUCK NO YOU DONT SELL NOW! HODL!!! 💎🤲🚀🚀📈

I just wanted to point out that FUD comes from all directions, family, coworkers, friends… 

My dad is awesome and has always been there for me and helped me when needed. I love the guy, he’s great. Just wanted to share something we could communicate on and both be hyped about. Everytime I bring it up, it’s laughs and jokes. We’ve never really connected on anything collectively.

Sometimes ppl don’t realize until it’s too late and things are said or jokes are made, he’s getting that car that I always told him would be a HotWheels car. 

Love you all and LFG!!! Just no dancing 💃
