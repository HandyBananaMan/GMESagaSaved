<p>u/prsmike has correctly pointed out that the above scene from the tweet is different.  <a href="https://twitter.com/GMEdd/status/1407901613424054276?s=09">https://twitter.com/GMEdd/status/1407901613424054276?s=09</a></p>
<p>Good evening apes,</p>
<p>Gather round. Finally I can contribute to something here that I know about. Too smooth brained for FTD cycles but just wrinkled enough for South Park references. As a Canadian I understand Terrence and Phillip since we speak with the top halves of our heads.</p>
<p>~~This is the full scene to Ryan Cohens tweet:~~  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF0J8dFy2gE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF0J8dFy2gE</a></p>
<p>Jump to 0:40 if you can't spend 39 seconds of your lives watching quality content. Notice anything? Kenny farts on a match and DIES. KENNY DIES. Further, Kenny died in every episode until <a href="https://www.cbr.com/why-south-park-doesnt-kill-kenny/">Season 5</a>:  Kenny's death was a running gag in every episode.</p>
<p>What other related South Park related tweet is there?  How about this one:</p>

<p>I FART ON YOUR GRAVE. That's a direct quote from the show and game. Hmmm.. What else? Cartman says DUMB ASS a lot. Ryans been hitting the South Park binge, a man of excellent taste.</p>
<p>I don't believe the fart tweet was related to T+21 at all. Our very own RC has been hitting us with a lot of South Park references in his tweets and I intend to investigate this further.</p>
<p>The only thing left is for Ryan to tweet "OMG THEY KILLED KENNY" but that would be too blatant. My bias is confirmed and my tits are jacked.</p>
<p><strong>RYAN IF YOU'RE WATCHING HIT US WITH A TWEET ABOUT SATAN AND SADDAM.</strong></p>
