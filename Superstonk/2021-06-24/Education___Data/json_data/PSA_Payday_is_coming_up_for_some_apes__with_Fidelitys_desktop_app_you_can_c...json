    "selftext": " It\u2019s late and I just woke up again from my weird insomniac sleep schedule of 4hrs before finally falling back asleep around 3am-ish. But with T+21 and the RC tweet all but confirming a price rise tomorrow with his high 90\u2019s percentage of tweeting cryptic but relevant memes around these dates\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t just place a market order through a mobile app. Download the Fidelity desktop app if you\u2019re on that broker service and with the advanced options, you can choose the NASDAQ market to place your order.\n\nWe have 350K+ apes round these parts. Imagine a few thousand or tens of thousands of apes actually place their orders without it being rerouted until the T+2 rule applies when market makers have time to match best buys with sells (notice the price usually hops up around Mon/Tues like a steady beat)\n\nNow millions being put into our shares being bought and adding to market value on tomorrow\u2019s T+21 date. Well, slap me silly, but it might actually make a dent against Shitadell\u2019s armor as they\u2019ve shaved off more and more of it for their ammo that keeps missing apes cause we\u2019re just in the trenches playing cards and laughing at memes while occasionally lobbing a payday grenade towards the line.\n\nBe good to each other and if possible, figure out a way to place order in a real time market. If a wrinkled brain ape won\u2019t post a guide to choosing which market through the Fidelity app, I\u2019ll be happy to do so along with the DD of our orders not being put into place for days and just hovering around in the dark pool for the best margin spread profits.",
