<p>How do you do fellow apes!</p>
<p>Just as a friendly reminder since a lot of us are excited about GME joining the Russell 1000, this won't happen until AFTER market close so if there is any effect from this, we won't see it until Monday.</p>

<p>Not meaning to dash anyone's hopes about tomorrow but just bringing awareness.</p>

<p>EDIT: Been in customer service training all morning =/</p>
<p>I do want to say up front that I personally have not seen any confirmation that GME is being added to the Russell 1000. If you have, please let me know and I will update the post with evidence. I mainly made this post as a PSA that being added doesn't take effect until after market hours.</p>
<p>EDIT7: u/SnooFloofs1628 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o735ef/psa_gme_will_not_be_joining_the_russell_1000/h2x0wmg/?context=3">provided the closest thing we have to confirmation wihtout it coming directly form the Russell itself.</a></p>
<p>EDIT2: As u/wooden_seats notes below, the recalibration starts before the end of day so we may see some movement near the end of power hour.</p>
<p>EDIT3: *Insert rocket ship, moon, diamond, and hands emojis* (Don't know how to emote on computer)</p>

<p>EDIT6: thanks for all of the awards guys! I honestly didn't expect this to get as big as it did (that's what she said). The awards are appreciated, but save your money and go spend it on more GME! BUY &amp; HODL</p>
<p>NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE</p>
