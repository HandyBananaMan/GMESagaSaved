    "selftext": "This is in fact the most hyped week since February. What do you expect them to do? The same thing everytime we are hyped. They are trying to board us out but the only thing they are doing is shaking off the paper hands off the rocket \ud83d\ude80. It's like a vicious cycle, every time they do this the rocket loses more and more paper hands & at the same time gains more & more diamond hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c.\n\n To summarize trust the DD, the DD is the engine. RC is the pilot & diamond hands are the fuel.\n\nHODL \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

They aren't playing with stonks anymore, they are playing psychology. All they have left is to play with our emotions to break us up & shake our hands.",
