I may know exactly who owns those:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DSeM04L.png\n\nSo we know our friend Shitadel has 3,271,400 shares in puts on GME or **32714** in option contracts from their latest 13F filing:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/elgrTIK.png\n\n\nWe also know that Susquehanna has 6,151,100 shares in puts on GME or **61511** in option contracts from their latest 13F filing:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NzoM02s.png \n\nHmm....so at this point we have 32714 + 61511 = 94225 in option contracts.\n\nNow I was wondering what our old friend was up to before they hid their 13F filings:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqv61hbyj8261.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1c222b8b146ae8a94fabe5b01eade4a42b33e03\n\nMELVIN CAPITAL with 5,400,000 in GME puts or **54000** in option contracts for **July 16th.**\n\nNow at this point I was like: \"no way this matches exactly or close by\".\n\n32714 + 61511 + 54000 = **148,225** in OPTION CONTRACTS COMBINED.\n\nRemember how those motherfuckers said they closed their public put positions?\n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/melvin-capital-closes-out-public-short-positions-after-gamestop-losses-2021-5-1030447490\n\nEDIT:\nTo clarify - Melvin's 13F with 15$ strike is the last one from last year that revealed their position.\n\nThey can roll them down and change the price:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rolldown.asp\n\nEDIT2: \nJust so everybody knows - this might not have anything to do with the short positions. We can only speculate on those because they aren't public. But yes we can assume since they still have shitload of puts they also have massive short positions.",
