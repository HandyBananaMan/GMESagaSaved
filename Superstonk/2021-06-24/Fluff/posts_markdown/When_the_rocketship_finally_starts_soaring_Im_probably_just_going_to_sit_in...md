Because after twenty years of working 50+ hours a week to make ends meet, I can rest

I finally have the time and money to get my migraines under control

mine & my son's future is financially secure

I can buy my dad a house

I can make the world a better place

and because the little guy *can* win

The instant reaction to this post made me tear up. I love all of you
