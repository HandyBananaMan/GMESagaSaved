1. The first reason being, they don't HAVE to cover FTDs on the T+21 day cycle. If you've read the all the DD's regarding this theory, and the fact that we've been able to single this down to a specific date  every month, you'd know that the net capital requirements can be fulfilled any day within that T+21 day timeframe. The run-up we saw in the early days of June were, in my opinion, inorganic price movements and likely a result of them attempting to discredit our "confirmed" T+21 FTD cycle theory in order to confuse us and demoralise us. In my smooth-brained opinion, they spread out their buybacks of this cycle's FTDs between 6/1-6/8 because they knew they were going to spend a fuck-ton of their ammo shorting the price down after the shareholder meeting and Gamestop's positive earnings call. Again, in my opinion, this was their hail mary because they knew the rules that would up-end them would be in place and they needed one last hurrah to try and fuck our morale and get us to sell.

2. The second reason, if they don't cover FTDs they are legally barred (banned, whatever term you want to use) from shorting any longer. They have to satisfy these FTDs or their Market Making abilities are removed and they are no longer allowed to short the stock. If they didn't cover their FTDs at all during the week listed above then this is them throwing in the towel and they will be unable to short the stock into tomorrow and the following week(s). 

Or it could be a third option that I'm unaware of that we will have to wait to try and uncover to figure out what's going on. Time is still on our side, though.

Buy & hodl. Not financial advice. Only up.

**EDIT:** - both theories fit into the [Death by 1000 Cuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0mn0y/in_death_by_1000_cuts_shf_just_received_their_999/) theory. We could see margin calls and forced liquidations in the near future and this is their behavior in the interim of the inevitable occurring. Crossing my fingers.

**EDIT2:** ![Juneteenth Federal Holiday - this could also](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o77jm5/i_had_a_thought_it_really_hurt_but_what_if_i_told/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) explain why we didn't see the validation of the T+21 price spike today.
