Hey Apes ... think about what you are reading today, lots of expectations regarding the T-21 cycle and where the price may go or not.  

At the same time you are reading pnthe sub many conflicting stories about 005 being posted by SEC and Apes interpretations of it, one way or another.


The only weapon that they have left is their ability to manipulate the markets to conflict with our expectations.  Once you have no expectations their power goes away.

That is our end game .... no expectations 

If there isn't 7 digits in the price of the stock nothing matters or is happening to it yet.

This is the way.
