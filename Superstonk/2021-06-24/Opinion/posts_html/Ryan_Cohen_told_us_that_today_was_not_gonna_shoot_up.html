<p>Every time he posts something that has to do with poop, its a sign of a red day.<br />
He posted Mr. Hankey the christmas poo, before a dip.<br />
He posted that "Dumb and Dumber" Clip, before a dip.<br />
And he posted Terrance and Phillip farting, before a small dip.</p>
<p>Probably because he knew we expected a green day.</p>
<p>So he knew and he told us.I don't know how he knew. <br />
And I don't know what he knows.<br />
But he somehow knew.Maybe its because of the federal Holiday, that its +1 Day, but I don't know.</p>
<p>I still like the stock.<br />
And I still like R.C. in the Chair, I feel like Gamestop is in good hands, Apes included.  </p>
<p>Edit:<br />
Wow, thanks for the awards!<br />
This wasn't initially my theory, I did read it on superstonk after one of those poop tweets.<br />
Some wrinkled apes added some more info:  </p>
<p>u/w2re3tr4 added:" 4/29 Tweet: -17.5% cumulative after 7 trading days (two positive days +0.1%, +1.0%)</p>
<p>3/11 Tweet: -53.7% cumulative after 9 trading days (one positive day +0.8%)"</p>
<p>u/DotAdewk added:" To add on to OP, the price for GME dropped for 9 trading days after both the Dumb and Dumber pooping gif (March 11-24) and Mr. Hankey picture (April 29-May 11). We'll see if joining the Russell 1000 breaks the trend!"</p>
<p>u/BluPrince added:"You forgot the Blockbuster video tweet w/ poop emoji from Jan. 6, which also preceded a red day."  </p>
<p>I am also not 100% married to the whole t+21 theory, maybe its t+1 because of SEC holiday, maybe its t+35.<br />
Maybe something else disrupted the theory and it will pop up again, I don't know.  </p>
<p>I am looking forward to all new theories, though it does not have any influence on when I buy.<br />
I just buy whenever I got some money and am not really concerned about dips or not dips.<br />
When it goes up it will not matter and those extra shares are for the infinity pool anyway.</p>
