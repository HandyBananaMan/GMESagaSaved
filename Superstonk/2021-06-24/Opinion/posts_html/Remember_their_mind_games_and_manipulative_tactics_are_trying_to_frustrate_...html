<p>Hey Apes ... think about what you are reading today, lots of expectations regarding the T-21 cycle and where the price may go or not.  </p>
<p>At the same time you are reading pnthe sub many conflicting stories about 005 being posted by SEC and Apes interpretations of it, one way or another.</p>
<p>The only weapon that they have left is their ability to manipulate the markets to conflict with our expectations.  Once you have no expectations their power goes away.</p>
<p>That is our end game .... no expectations </p>
<p>If there isn't 7 digits in the price of the stock nothing matters or is happening to it yet.</p>
<p>This is the way.</p>
