Alright guys - I thought I would make this post since it seems like people missed the point of the net capital cycle and why 21 days was a thing.

There are two important parts of it that made up the original theory.

[ The Initial liability that is carried on the books \(30&#37; of the position\)](https://preview.redd.it/uy0w3dfe4c771.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2539e3aafd2a55b3a321652c625c301ac4e0f99)

&#x200B;

[And the increasing 25&#37; capital that must be carried every 7 days.  Securities unresolved after discovery sounds like fancy words for naked shorting to me.](https://preview.redd.it/fqsu4daf4c771.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b6a95a09e8c5d58a7b385313bea42d6134533b)

On the 21st business day, they would need to put up 30%+75% (105%) of the ***current*** market price.  But they got cash when they shorted 21 days ago for the ***full*** share price.

On a lot of of the old cycles the price had to return back to the original price 21 trading days in the past because the effective supply was returning back to where it was, and no one was selling.  Supply and demand curves would reset, price would return to normal and they would be immediately in the red by 5% because of how the calculation is done.

[April cycle \(After the ATM offering was completed\) ](https://preview.redd.it/lyp3d69q6c771.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c1091c8721b94f172a2d037912d8fe9ad72d7c8)

&#x200B;

Why didn't it happen today?  5 million shares were introduced into the system, so the ***actual*** supply increased.  I don't think we have a billion in buying power, so the new price dropped below where the shorts were opened on this cycle.  This is what it roughly looks like. 

[105&#37; of 212 is $222.6 in capital they need to post.  But they probably got \>$240 when they \\"shorted\\" around the 26th.  Incidentally, 105&#37; of today's high \(227.45\) is $238.82.](https://preview.redd.it/ui1o5vnj5c771.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=db9fbdcdd99daf0a2004872618b2af4f83afe78d)

Looking at how much cash they got when starting to naked short after the last run up to get it under control, they have enough capital to ride out the 21->28 day cycle.  There were some theories that Juneteenth was the cause of the delay - ***if nothing happens tomorrow, don't panic***.  If they can get the price low enough, they might be able to ride it all the way to the 35 calendar day cycle in CFR242.204 (Closeout requirements).

TLDR - HODL.
