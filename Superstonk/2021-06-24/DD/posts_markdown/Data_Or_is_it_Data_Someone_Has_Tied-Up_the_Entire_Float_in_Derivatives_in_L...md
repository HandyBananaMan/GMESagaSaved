**GME GO BRRR**

What's up nerds! Seriously some whack shit coming up over the last few weeks, hey? The DD writers have even divided up their work to divide and conquer the hedgie meatballs.

Seriously, we took this advice and more and more are we pulling strings to unravel their little games.

**INTRO-FUCKING-DUCTION**

SO. I kind of got a lot of studying done on options while my potato clock computer (banana powered?) tried to process the massive amounts of options data I kept feeding into excel sheets.  I caught them. Hehe. 

A while ago, I showed you guys the Options Clearing Corp and their banker filled board representing MASSIVELY OVERLEVERAGED COMPANIES INVOLVED IN GME POSITIONS. Like Wolverine Trading, who has an unhedged position. Or BoA, who decided they would just lie and stop covering it because it's going to fuck them (lol), or Interactive Brokers who halted trading. Or Shitadel, who's short positions plus Suspecthanna and Melvin's equal exactly those July 16 numbers. Haha fucking idiots. Seriously, it just goes on and on. They are even trying their best to change the IV and hide it. And before one of you retards tells me it's because of "tHe BlACk SchOleS", black-scholes helps with European options only, it is useless for American options because American options can be exercised at any time. Basically, you have to calculate it in a different fashion, it requires taking all the strikes, the greeks, and a series of complex math equations, blah blah blah. Not technically why I am here now. Just background to hopefully give some context why and how these people are fucking with the maths.

Enough of the wall of text. Here's the fucking data. Or data, however you pronounce it. Seriously, is it gamestonk, gamestop, or gamestock now? I don't even know anymore.

**DATA (OR DATA?)**

Something fun happens when you start to compare all the Open Interest day over day and see how many open contracts keep changing. You can see how many positions are being bought/sold to close or open, because they are updated automatically each day by the OCC. So in ape, bigger number in OI means positions opened, smaller number means positions closed (net). Last week someone showed us the MASSIVE amount of volume trading back and forth. Unless these are dark pool option contracts, these are just the same shares being passed back and forth. I still don't know why they would do it.

So I took all the data and compared it day over day. And it gave me the constant change in OI for the last two weeks. You should see the written/opened contracts vs. those being exercised or closed.

I have also noticed a huge change in OTM contracts. This means one of two things. Either someone is buying to close their position ever so slowly to not raise suspicion, or someone is exercising DEEP OTM options to gain SOME shares and hopefully hedge their current fucked up position.

Which leads to my next point. Someone besides Citadel, Sus, and Melvin are closing positions slowly to throttle the rocket. THIS HAS TO BE THE BANKS. THERE ARE NO OTHER ENTITIES WITH HUGE, HIDDEN, PROPRIETARY TRADING POSTIONS.

This is why there are late night meetings. Figure heads like Gensler, Powell, Yellen - with the president. They are all trying to make sure the G-SIBs are protected because the wealthy have already threatened them. Slowly exiting positions, all while sacrificing the three. Citadel, Susquehanna, and Melvin. Who else has been brought up? We are constantly seeing it. No one else is an issue? Ok sure. They are doing this by constantly closing OTM positions, and writing new strikes weekly to collect premiums.

Want to see something else fucked up? The total amount of contracts OPENED in the last three weeks, represents almost the entire free float. Lol. Even the closed positions is no where near the equivalent of these shares. So, how do you write a bunch of new strikes to change your positions? NAKED OF COURSE! Because we own the float (obviously, bankie retard), and you guys are trying to hide your junk. And failing. We found you.

**IN SHORT**

So here you have it. This for me, is **definitive proof** of naked shorting In less than 3 weeks, the float has been tied up in options. As the SEC states, there are times when naked shorting is necessary. But, with GME, this is not. No debt and $2B in cash, tech board, huge investor base that is going to hold. There is absolute NO FUCKING REASON why this should be continuing. Someone needs to figure this out, before people stop believing in the establishments and we ditch this system forever. Because when this is over, we're going to mop the floor with you guys, too. Millennials and Gen Z are sick of this garbage, and we are going to change you into irrelevant, mom and pop retail banks who need to suck dick to survive. And the DTCC admitting to one security with the majority of risk, has solidified this. Fuck you, pay me - or go bankrupt. We aren't selling for less than you sucking dick to pay your bills.

Oh, and I have all the new strikes being written daily (today, they wrote 192.50 and 197.50 for July 2 - majority sold were Puts, so if they are trying to make some money back, expect sub 200$ prices to help them get a win - or someone is keeping these OTM). If anyone wants the data to verify, I will provide it to the mods only. They are either using futures as leverage (which is still naked), or blatantly just aren't trying to hide it anymore. Ill let you guys decide. 

Cheers bros, wear your hellmitc - it might get worse before it gets better.
