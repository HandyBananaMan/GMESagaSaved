Look at these two articles. One on NYT and another on Yahoo.

[NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/economy/fed-blackrock-pandemic-crisis.html?referringSource=articleShare) is talking about how the BlackRock has become an arm of the federal government. They have the phone records and calendars to show just how much the Federal Government collaborated with BlackRock before coming to their decisions amid the pandemic crash. [Here's the calendar](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/236/STM-Jan-Mar-2020-Calendars-Scanned.pdf). [Here are the emails](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/black-rock-emails-march-april-2020/dde950256eaa64f7/full.pdf).

[And here's the Yahoo article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nouriel-roubini-on-economic-outlook-and-inflation-132954798.html), quoting Professor Roubini of the New York University. If you don't know him, he is a prophet of economic forecasting. He predicted the Housing Bubble of the 2008. Do you know what his nickname used to be? Cassandra. Seems familiar, huh? (This is from Wikipedia. The quote was something like "He was a Cassandra, now he is a Sage) FYI, he is widely known as his more gloomy nickname, Dr. Doom. I kinda wish Stanley Kubrick was around to make another movie, this time titled Dr. Doom.

In the Yahoo article, he is talking about how the inflation is putting the Fed in a really difficult spot. They can't raise the rates, but not raising them is also leading to deterioration of the economy. Guess who has been talking about this exact problem for the past 6 months? r/Superstonk. All the DDs are being confirmed. Stay calm and don't give in to the FUD.

Back in January everyone was saying that the media changing their stance and talking openly about these issues will mark the beginning of the end. There are too many articles focusing on the possibilities of an economic crash/hyperinflation in the recent weeks. They are grooming the public for what is to come.

I know it is a meme at this point, but -

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE ENDGAME, ONCE AGAIN.
