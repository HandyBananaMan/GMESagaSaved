# Title: Having a rule in place doesn't mean "Moon now" right when HFs flicked the office lights on this morning. Stop expecting immediate results! Events take time to become, well, events.

Just because a favorable regulation comes into effect today doesn't mean margin calls & liquidations will happen the moment they turned the key to open their office door. We're killing ourselves with assuming tendies are coming today. We probably won't even know if/when any HF gets liquidated until days/weeks later.
