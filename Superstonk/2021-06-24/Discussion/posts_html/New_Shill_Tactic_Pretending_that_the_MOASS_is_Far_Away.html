<p>I've been seeing a worrying trend here recently, where lots of people, many with new-ish accounts, are essentially saying that GME is a long play, and that the MOASS will take a long time.</p>
<p>This is FALSE. The MOASS is imminent. Don't fall for this tactic and start putting your money someplace else because 'oh, GME is going to stay still anyways and it can wait until after this new coin or stonk I found'.</p>
<p>Citadel is on its death bed, the volume is susceptible to buying pressure of any sort and not to mention all the recent developments. A whale, a law or even a tweet can prove to be the catalyst that blows this thing up again.</p>
<p>DO NOT LOWER YOUR GUARD. Do not make the mistake of thinking this rocket won't take off next week. Buy whatever you can, leave your other investments for post-MOASS.</p>
<p>The hedgies don't want the squeeze. If they see no way of preventing it, they want as few people to benefit as possible. Know your enemy.</p>
<p>This is not financial advice.</p>
