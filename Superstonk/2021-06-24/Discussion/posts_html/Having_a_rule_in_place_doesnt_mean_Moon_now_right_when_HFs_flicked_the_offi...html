<p>Just because a favorable regulation comes into effect today doesn't mean margin calls &amp; liquidations will happen the moment they turned the key to open their office door. We're killing ourselves with assuming tendies are coming today. We probably won't even know if/when any HF gets liquidated until days/weeks later.</p>
