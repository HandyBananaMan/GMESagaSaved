    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing a few posts about the recent language in the RH law suit that points out that a certain security (stock) has \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d character. In other words, there is a stock with idiosyncratic risk. \n\nMany of you are looking up the general definition of idiosyncrasy, which will give you a general idea of what this means\u2026but if you really want to J them T\u2019s, look into the specific definition of idiosyncratic securities/stocks. \n\nOne particularly interesting point made on good ol Wiki, states, \u201cAccording to one macroeconomic model including a financial sector,[6] hedging idiosyncratic risk can be self-defeating as it leads to higher systemic risk, as it takes on more leverage. This makes the system less stable. Thus, while securitisation in principle reduces the costs of idiosyncratic shocks it ends up amplifying systemic risks in equilibrium.\u201d\n\nDo you get this? MM are principally forced to hedge against short positions they take. So, if a certain security, cough cough, which has been shorted beyond imagination, cough cough, has idiosyncratic risk\u2026AND if the MM are securing themselves agains the idiosyncratic shock\u2026this ends up amplifying systemic risk. You know what stock price is based on? \u2026systemic risk. \n\nLook it up. I\u2019ll wait. Then J your T\u2019s and meet me on the moon whenever all this decides to comply with the laws of economic physics. T+ whenever is coming\u2026\n\nEdit: systematic * (aka aggregate) risk rather. \n\nAnother interesting point made is that systematic risk is invervesly related to a securities beta value. \n\n\u201cAn important concept for evaluating an asset's exposure to systematic risk is beta. Since beta indicates the degree to which an asset's return is correlated with broader market outcomes, it is simply an indicator of an asset's vulnerability to systematic risk. Hence, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) directly ties an asset's equilibrium price to its exposure to systematic risk.\u201d",
