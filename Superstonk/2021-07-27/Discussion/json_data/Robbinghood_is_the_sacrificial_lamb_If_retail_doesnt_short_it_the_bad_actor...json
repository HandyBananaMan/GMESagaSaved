    "selftext": "With Shitadel processing the majority of retail order flow in the U.S. they\u2019ve got the insight into whether retail by and large decides to go long or go short on the steaming pile of excrement called Robbinghood, and the bad actors will do the opposite. \n\nI know everybody is getting sick of Robbinghood posts but I think this is one of their last plays and the result does have a profound effect on GME.\n\nThe only way retail wins this particular battle is to avoid it completely, to not go long or short and leave that garbage pile to burn itself out. Otherwise the powers will take the other side of the trade and they\u2019ll utterly crush retail.",
    "title": "Robbinghood is the sacrificial lamb. If retail doesn\u2019t short it the bad actors will short it into the ground and fuck over the dumb money stupid enough to buy the ipo. If retail does short it the bad actors will go long to crush the shorts, then short it into the ground themselves.",
