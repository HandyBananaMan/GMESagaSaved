    "selftext": "I made this point in an earlier post about the insanely low volume, but it will probably get lost in the noise and I feel it needs to be made.\n\nIn this incredibly low volume environment where no one wants to sell, Citadel as Market Maker, will step in to create synthetic shares for buy orders in the name of \"liquidity\", but by-and-large will never be able to locate these shares, leading to even more FTDs in the end.\n\nIn this role as 'Market Maker', Citadel isn't doing anything *wrong* per se, but it *will* lead to additional FTDs which is really the heart of this entire saga!\n\nNot to say they didn't start the whole mess of FTDs with *illegal naked shorting*, but now this low volume exposes a major flaw in this whole Market Making business which I think has been alluded to by Dr. T and Dave Lauer...\n\nAnd that is this: in the name of the all-mighty Liquidity (bow down before the Liquidity Gods), we get a major problem with true price discovery. By stepping in the middle of this buy, when truly *no one wants to sell*, and inserting a synthetic share as if the market *is* selling (they're just being a little shy), it hides this natural market fact and significantly reduces what would be *organic* upward pricing pressure!\n\nNow, in the end, I think Citadel is happy to do this and reduce the price, and can even claim \"Hey, I was just doing my market maker job, man!\", but it exposes a fundamental flaw in this whole Market Making liquidity fever dream.",
