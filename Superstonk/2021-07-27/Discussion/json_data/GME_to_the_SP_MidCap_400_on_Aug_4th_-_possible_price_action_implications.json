    "selftext": "Most of you have probably already read that GME will be moving from the S&P small cap 600 to the S&P mid cap 400 before trading on Aug. 4. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gxo-logistics-victoria-s-secret-and-gamestop-to-join-s-p-midcap-400-271627422272](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gxo-logistics-victoria-s-secret-and-gamestop-to-join-s-p-midcap-400-271627422272)\n\nThe logical question is: WUT MEAN?\n\nWell, I've highlighted some conclusions from a preliminary academic report out of Texas A&M ([https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&rep=rep1&type=pdf)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ml97oi62wtd71.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc39ca24e5027b620bf8488f7c8851d20817e2f\n\nSo.....positive price response the day after announcement (TOMORROW), and additional movement in same direction through implementation (EVERY DAY FROM NOW UNTIL AUG 4). After Aug. 4 (when GME joins mid cap 400), we may see some pullback, but even after 10 days overall price increase will be evident from the promotion to S&P mid cap 400.\n\nHopefully we see some green days ahead from this, maybe trigger some FOMO, and maybe get a boost from an announcement of some sort. Either way, this should bring back some volume and my tatas are jacked.\n\nedit1: effing typo\n\nedit2: Yes, good news for GME usually does result in a price drop. We may get a tasty dip since GME tends to defy every other stock in the history of the stock market. There are going to be entire theses and dissertations written on this stock.",
