Most of you have probably already read that GME will be moving from the S&P small cap 600 to the S&P mid cap 400 before trading on Aug. 4.

The logical question is: WUT MEAN?

Well, I've highlighted some conclusions from a preliminary academic report out of Texas A&M ([https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&rep=rep1&type=pdf)).

So.....positive price response the day after announcement (TOMORROW), and additional movement in same direction through implementation (EVERY DAY FROM NOW UNTIL AUG 4). After Aug. 4 (when GME joins mid cap 400), we may see some pullback, but even after 10 days overall price increase will be evident from the promotion to S&P mid cap 400.

Hopefully we see some green days ahead from this, maybe trigger some FOMO, and maybe get a boost from an announcement of some sort. Either way, this should bring back some volume and my tatas are jacked.

edit1: effing typo

edit2: Yes, good news for GME usually does result in a price drop. We may get a tasty dip since GME tends to defy every other stock in the history of the stock market. There are going to be entire theses and dissertations written on this stock.
