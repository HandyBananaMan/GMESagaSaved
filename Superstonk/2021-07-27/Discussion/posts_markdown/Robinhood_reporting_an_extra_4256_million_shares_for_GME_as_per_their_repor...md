If you look at the market caps for GME on yahoo and Robinhood, there is a massive divide in market cap.   


Since the market cap is the sum of the outstanding shares multiplied by the price, it should be close to the same across the board.   


With Robbingthehood, there seem to be an additional 42.56 million shares as Robinhood is reporting a market cap of $21.02 BILLION.  


The only real reason I can see for something like this is that Robinhood has more shares that their computers can see compared to the regular market, AKA it is possible that Robinhood users still have shittons of shares in the brokerage, \*OR\* Robinhood knows about a certain number of synthetics.
