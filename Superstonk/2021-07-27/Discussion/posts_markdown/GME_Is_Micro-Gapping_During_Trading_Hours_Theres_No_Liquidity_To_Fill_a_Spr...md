Sitting here watching the 1m candles, and I've noticed today that prices aren't running... they are jumping.

Whether it's up or down, the price is gapping to new prices instead of being bought in to it.

You can see the huge ~$1 gaps in either direction on the 1m.

There's no shares to fill in-between the prices. We're about to see some craziness...
