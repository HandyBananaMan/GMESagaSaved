You can see historical data for GME here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

You can even download it so you can sort by column if you have something that can read .csv properly. 

I really think we're approaching the breaking point here. There is no movement - hasn't been for a while now.
