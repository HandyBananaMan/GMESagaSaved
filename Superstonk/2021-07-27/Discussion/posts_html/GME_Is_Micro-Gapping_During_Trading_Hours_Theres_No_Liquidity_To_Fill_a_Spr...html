<p>Sitting here watching the 1m candles, and I've noticed today that prices aren't running... they are jumping.</p>
<p>Whether it's up or down, the price is gapping to new prices instead of being bought in to it.</p>

<p>You can see the huge ~$1 gaps in either direction on the 1m.</p>
<p>There's no shares to fill in-between the prices. We're about to see some craziness...</p>
