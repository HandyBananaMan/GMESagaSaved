<p>You can see historical data for GME here: <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical">https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical</a></p>
<p>You can even download it so you can sort by column if you have something that can read .csv properly. </p>
<p>I really think we're approaching the breaking point here. There is no movement - hasn't been for a while now.</p>
