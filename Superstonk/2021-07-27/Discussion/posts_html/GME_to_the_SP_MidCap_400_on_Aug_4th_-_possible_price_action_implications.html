<p>Most of you have probably already read that GME will be moving from the S&amp;P small cap 600 to the S&amp;P mid cap 400 before trading on Aug. 4. <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gxo-logistics-victoria-s-secret-and-gamestop-to-join-s-p-midcap-400-271627422272">https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gxo-logistics-victoria-s-secret-and-gamestop-to-join-s-p-midcap-400-271627422272</a></p>
<p>The logical question is: WUT MEAN?</p>
<p>Well, I've highlighted some conclusions from a preliminary academic report out of Texas A&amp;M (<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>).</p>

<p>So.....positive price response the day after announcement (TOMORROW), and additional movement in same direction through implementation (EVERY DAY FROM NOW UNTIL AUG 4). After Aug. 4 (when GME joins mid cap 400), we may see some pullback, but even after 10 days overall price increase will be evident from the promotion to S&amp;P mid cap 400.</p>
<p>Hopefully we see some green days ahead from this, maybe trigger some FOMO, and maybe get a boost from an announcement of some sort. Either way, this should bring back some volume and my tatas are jacked.</p>
<p>edit1: effing typo</p>
<p>edit2: Yes, good news for GME usually does result in a price drop. We may get a tasty dip since GME tends to defy every other stock in the history of the stock market. There are going to be entire theses and dissertations written on this stock.</p>
