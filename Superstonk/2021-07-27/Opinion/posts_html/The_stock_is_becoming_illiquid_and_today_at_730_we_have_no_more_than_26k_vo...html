<p>I am calling it right now today we will se no more than 700-800k volume eod, and they stock will trade in a slow upwards trend.<br />
Today might likely be the last day we will see volume this low. <br />
The only other thought i have is that something big will happen today, cause reddit has been fuckin around alot lately and this post was almost impossible to make.  </p>
<p>700-800k eod volume and 1 trillion RRP are my thoughts for the day.</p>
<p>Edit: Since I'm being heavily ridiculed and getting slot of hate for my post i want to clarify what i meant about something big. 
What i meant is that based on the volume and my OWN calculations that might be faulty 700-800k eod volume is my personal low point prediction for today, and that i don't think we will pass 1 million. </p>
<p>I meant that if something big will happen it may interfer with my prediction.
For example if a shf really starts to close their positions or if we experience more fuckery in the form of another huge sell off by shorters like the one in March..</p>
<p>I haven't tried to promise anyone something big will happen i simply said. </p>
<p>And btw if my prediction is right something big has indeed happened today 700-1 mil eod volume today would be huge. </p>
<p>Since it's further proof of our thesis...</p>
<p>PREDICTION will post down here if i got anything right.</p>
<p>Something big: Chinese exchange *</p>
<p>Volume:</p>
<p>RRP: 927 billion.</p>
<p>Edit 2: i have never gotten this amount of hate and condescending comments ever in my life about a post i made just for fun and to try and guess some things based on my own calculations and trends I've been noticing. </p>
<p>I did flair it as opinion cause i didn't want anyone to think this was DD or some kind of absolute truth. 
For the same reason i didn't post or talk about the calculations i have made myself so this could be mistaken as DD. </p>
<p>By something big i never stated that it would show om today's Price, however ppl are failing to realize cause of blind hate towards me and the OPINION i tried to share that today's movement on the Chinese exchange is something really big. </p>
<p>The RRP to 1 trillion was just my own personal fun xtra to go together with my volume prediction. 
I also thought it would move upwards today witch it clearly did but i shot trough the ceiling and i think thats ok, it didn't matter to me so much to be wrong or right about it.</p>
<p>As for volume i made this prediction 2 hours before market open based on previous volume in pre market and how it correlates to eod volume. My calculations got me to the number 745,xxx and i thought it was cool to share it. </p>
<p>Of course i was early and i could have made a better prediction and i contemplated this with myself if i should wait with my prediction til i had more to go by. </p>
<p>But i figured that it would be cooler to make it early, not to take a swing in the dark but to get a more wholesome and fun response. </p>
<p>The truth is the longer you wait with calling something the later it just becomes the obvious and the prediction doesn't hold the same value anymore. </p>
<p>However all the hate i am getting and people shit talking me really scares me, cause i have in no way tried to misslead anyone nor have i willingly tried to tell lies. </p>
<p>You must understand that a prediction is just a guess and my guess was wrong i can deal with it why can't you? </p>
<p>The slow upwards trend was a prediction based on most recent days and how my prediction on the new low volume would be shown in the price action. </p>
<p>I was wrong here as well i am sorry if anyone is offended. </p>
<p>However i want to state that alot of our situation is based on predictions and it's something we should be more welcoming towards since it's the most basic reason we are here. </p>
<p>And i don't know if all this hate was actual apes or if it was some kind of shill.
Cause with the sheer amount of hate and trashy comments i have gotten today i kinda don't understand the reason for a distribution of wealth if people this shitty will become millionaires. </p>
<p>Anyways take care! And have a nice weekend i will not be on reddit for a while now.. i want to reevaluate this sub and reddit as a whole has become.</p>
<p>Edit 3. Pls do not send more concerned redditor suicide watch things about me, i do not want to harm myself and tbh i find it quite offensive since i know people who sadly have taken their own life. And there is nothing fun with it. </p>
<p>If this is real concerns you can stop with it. I am fine.</p>
