Serious question. While the delay of MOASS has allowed me and numerous others to up my position numerous times, it has undoubtedly lead to some people reducing positions due to unexpected bills/needs. There have been a number of theories discussing the possibility that the MOASS is currently being prevented in order to reduce the chance of a market crash while the DTCC gets these new rules in place.

So my question is simple... Preventing anything from happening naturally in the market is manipulation. What's to stop GameStop, participants, other entities from filing suits if it's determined that they did indeed delay MOASS until they were ready for it?
