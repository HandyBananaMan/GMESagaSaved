LOL.. but it's okay, as this filing really answers a lot of questions that I personally had regarding NSCC-803 / 010.\n\nLet's dive in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2v9rhvdbotd71.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=2578c69b2b18676bb58852f70a5034c847b56373\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q42695xcotd71.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=dae457cd1bc94f7fae9bb3c0e92c1bf067c8709e\n\nBasically, the NSCC is revising its' margining methodology to ***REMOVE*** institutional delivery transactions that are processed through the \"ID Net Service\" from the calculation of Members' Required Deposits to the Clearing Fund.\n\nIt goes on to say that that the ID Transactions that have been processed through the Continuous Net Settlement system **ARE NOT** subject to NSCC's trade guarantee.\n\nThe main point: The proposed change would ***IMPROVE*** NSCC's ability to collect fund deposits more accurately ***in the event of a member default.***\n\n***==================================================================================***\n\n***OVERVIEW OF ID TRANSACTIONS AND THE ID NET SERVICE***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vy1yiojwotd71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e214478f17b7706e70555d160b9406b357e46ec\n\nParties involved in an ID Transaction are the institutional investor (mutual fund, insurance company, hedge funds, bank trust & pensions\n\nInvestment Manager = Buying broker, selling broker, and custodian banks\n\nIt's basically a trade allocation system, that works as follows:\n\n1. After Execution (the purchase or selling of shares), the allocation details of ID transactions are matched between the executing broker / manager or institutional investor's custodian bank. \n2. After an executing broker has provided final notice of execution, the investment managers provide client trade allocation data to the executing broker using the **Institutional Trade Processing Service**. (***ITP)***\n3. After the broker accepts and processes the trade allocations, electronic confirmation is provided through ITP's TradeSuite ID service for affirmation.\n4. After the trade details are confirmed, the delivery details are sent to the DTC for settlement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lrrmb43wptd71.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e3707af1602f81b134fca0f217a6f5d1aaa8a3\n\nParticipation in the ID Net Service is optional. \n\nEligibility requires the broker-dealer be:\n\n1. Member of NSCC\n2. Participant of DTC\n\nEligibility requires the custodian bank be:\n\n1. A DTC participant.\n\nThe cut-off time is 11:30 AM eastern on settlement day.\n\nIf the transactions are not completed by that time, the transactions are exited from NSCC's systems and must be settled on a trade-for-trade basis away from NSCC.\n\n==================================================================================\n\n**REQUIRED FUND DEPOSIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF ID NET TRANSACTIONS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucu6xg7hqtd71.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbcbdda53181338f60a422b5a6c1f06c3a60ab47\n\nThe required fund deposit serves as each member's margin.\n\nThe objective of this fund is to ***mitigate*** losses in the event of liquidating a member's portfolio due to a ***member default.***\n\n***THE AGGREGATE OF ALL MEMBERS' REQUIRED FUND DEPOSITS = THE CLEARING FUND OF NSCC***\n\nIf a member defaults, the NSCC will access the clearing fund if a member's required deposit is insufficient to satisfy losses to NSCC.\n\n\\*HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE SEEN ***MITIGATION*** LATELY? JEEBUS.\n\n\\*EXPECTING BIG LOSSES, EH?\n\nWhen NSCC ceases to act for a member, that member is then referred to as a DEFAULTED MEMBER.\n\n==================================================================================\n\n**REQUIRED FUND DEPOSIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT OF ID NET TRANSACTIONS**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pttmv61rtd71.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f2b866776e8891b223a4f542fe536da92558783\n\n==================================================================================\n\nPROPOSED ENHANCEMENT TO NSCC'S MARGINING METHODOLOGY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wra4j4e2rtd71.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb68f38ef5ede7cc70461485a5645616e5e90f2\n\nNSCC is proposing to enhance the margining methodology to remove ID Net Transactions from the calculation of the fund deposit.\n\n1. NSCC does not guaranty the completion of those transactions, so in the event of a Member default, the transactions are excluded from NSCC and are to be settled away from NSCC.\n2. By removing the ID Net from the deposit calculation, NSCC would be able to calculate and collect and amount that ***more accurately reflects the risks presented by positions it would be obligated to complete in the event of a member default.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FTDs? Maybe? ](https://preview.redd.it/392yeefkrtd71.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbcb818cc81653d4c0949f2ba3602cdee411cc3)\n\n==================================================================================\n\n**PROPOSED CHANGES TO CLARIFY THE NON-GUARANTEED STATUS OF ID NET SERVICE**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cr83apynrtd71.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=9836ae5325fbf8ba9b56caab7aca347d309fb26a\n\nID Net Service provides members with the operational benefit of netting transactions through the Continuous Net Settlement system, however, they're amending the rules to say that they ***are not subject to NSCC's trade guarantee, and would be exited from NSCC's systems in the event of a Member default.***\n\nBasically, the clarity within the rules and the proposed changes would create consistency and clarity, and would better protect the NSCC FROM **SOME EVENT THAT WOULD RESULT IN MEMBER DEFAULTS?**\n\nMOA-\n\nEh, we know.\n\n==================================================================================\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ck37r3i5std71.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=e458e971db20a4fd030594c402b919bc1caaad18\n\nThey want this implemented no later than 10 business days after the approval of the proposed change.\n\nWe'll need to wait for this to show up on the Federal Register, and then the count-down begins!  \n\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe NSCC filed YET again, this time, to remove the guarantee of their ID Net Transaction for netting down capital requirements from the rules. This is crazy, because it gives the hedge fucks even less options now, as capital netting is a HUGE benefit to reduce your deposit requirements. The NSCC has been filing for rules like this ***surrounding revamping their margin strategy / risk framework / and are making it extremely difficult for*** broker-dealers to continue their fuckery. \n\nBasically, the NSCC is doing everything they can in these languages to seal loopholes. The main purpose of this filing is to ***MORE ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE RISK WHEN THE NSCC MUST LIQUIDATE PORTFOLIOS DUE TO MEMBER DEFAULT.***\n\nAll this talk about defaults gets my tits jacked.\n\nI'm gonna go get bekked now.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>",
