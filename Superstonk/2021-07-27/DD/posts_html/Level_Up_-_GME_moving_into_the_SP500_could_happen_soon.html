<p><strong>TL;DR: Buy stuff from Gamestop before this Saturday and get HYPEEEEEEEE</strong></p>
<p>Most apes that have been around for at least a few months should remember the transition GME made from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000. There was a lot of speculation that this could drive a price increase due to ETFs and pension funds that track this index buying up GME. In the end not too much happened because, it seems, not that many funds or ETFs track the Russell 1000. </p>
<p><strong>Now a much bigger move is on the table, and it could happen quite soon.</strong></p>
<p>The S&amp;P500 is one of the most followed stock indices in the world. If GME were added to this index it would result in a massive amount of buying pressure - something that <strong>will almost certainly drive a share price increase and could very well lead to liftoff (MOASS).</strong></p>
<p>Let's take a look at the criteria to be included in the S&amp;P500 and whether GME meets these requirements. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Must be a US domiciled company ✅  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must be publicly listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ ✅  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must be a corporation (as opposed to other types of entity/structure e.g. a limited partnership) that has issued only one class of common stock. ✅ N.B. a few select companies e.g. Berkshire Hathaway were given a special exemption from this rule. Money talks 😉  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must have an unadjusted market cap of at least $13.1b ✅ E2a: From what I can see, the latest figure for GME shares outstanding is approx 76.82m which means if our share price is above $170.53 we meet this requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stock must be highly liquid. Using composite pricing and volume, the ratio of annual dollar value traded (defined as average closing price multiplied by historical volume over the last 365 calendar days) to float-adjusted market capitalization should be at least 1.00, and the stock should trade a minimum of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date. ✅  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company must be viable/profitable. The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter. ❌  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see GME meets all but one criteria. GME's last three quarterly earnings per share were -$0.45, +$1.34 and -$0.53. The aggregate of these is +$0.36 per share so any profit this quarter no matter how small will make the stock eligible for inclusion in the S&amp;P500.</p>
<p><strong>Gamestop's quarter 2 ends on Saturday July 31st - so go and shop in your favourite store before that date!</strong></p>
<p>GME's next quarterly earnings report will be released on September 9th 2021. The next S&amp;P500 rebalance after that date is on September 20th 2021. </p>
<p>So it looks like we're all set right? Not quite. There is one final hurdle and that is the S&amp;P500 selection committee. Unlike the Russell indices which are purely rule based, the S&amp;P500 has an index committee who can use their discretion when deciding which companies should be included in the index at each rebalancing date. They try to ensure each sector of the economy gets represented in the 500. GME is in the "consumer discretionary" GICS sector - sub-industry sector is "computer &amp; electronics retail". There are 63 "consumer discretionary" companies in the 500 and only one is in the same sub-industry - Best Buy (those guys suck). </p>
<p>They also try to avoid a high rate of turnover in the index - this means they try to avoid a situation where a company keeps entering and dropping out of the index at each rebalanced due to things like variations in market cap or quarterly earnings. 🚨Conjecture alert🚨 because GME has blown way past the market cap of some of the smaller companies in the index I don't think this will be an issue. </p>
<p>The only things that could realistically prevent GME from entering the S&amp;P500 soon are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failing to post a profit this quarter/next quarter</li>
<li>Corruption on the selection committee (every man has his price)</li>
<li>The committee believes the stock is not going to hold its current value over the long term - there is no actual rule around this but the intent to reduce volatility/turnover on the index could be held out as the reason here.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it is very, very likely that if the company can post a profit this quarter, it will be included in the S&amp;P500 shortly afterwards. Our company has been in this index before and it's about damn time it returns!! </p>
<p>It's certainly possible that this doesn't happen for us in September for one of the reasons noted above, but the S&amp;P500 is rebalanced every quarter. If not this time around, then GME will surely get there soon. Have faith in the company and its potential!</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards 🚀🚀🚀🚀 </p>

<p>Edit: credit to /u/fortus_gaming for pointing out to that news broke yesterday that GME is moving up from the S&amp;P smallcap 600 to the S&amp;P midcap 400! For obvious reasons this is bullish AF!</p>

<p>EDIT2: a lot of people are bringing up the fact that <strong>Tesla</strong> was denied entry to the S&amp;P500 before. This was because they failed on the 6th requirement. While the company was profitable overall, the business was not seen as viable, because at the time, they were making a loss on their core business (manufacture and sales of cars) but were selling their excess carbon credits to other auto manufacturers which made them a profit. <strong>This is the sole reason cited for Tesla's delayed entry into the S&amp;P500.</strong></p>
