<h1>This is what this new Fed-directed money-printing economy has turned into, inflated asset prices that have priced people out of homeownership!</h1>
<p>I just wonder how long the high-end demand can prop up the housing market? Especially since it was the 'little guy' carrying the burden last year--numbers show they are now priced out.</p>
<h1>Prices are all still jumping though!</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html">Construction Cost Index</a> by the Commerce Department tracks construction-related costs of single-family houses under construction but excludes the cost of land and other non-construction costs.</p>
<p>In June the index rose by 0.7% from May. Over the past six months annualized, the index spiked by 13.8%. Year-over-year, the index spiked by 11.1%, the biggest year-over-year jump since May 1980!</p>

<h1>All of this happening in the backdrop of the Fed still plowing away with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-bank-will-begin-reducing-bond-purchases-well-before-raising-interest-rates-powell-says-11618421656">$120 billion in assets purchases each month</a>:</h1>

<p>$40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. This will continue to depress mortgage rates and <strong>only continues to add gasoline to the inflation fire</strong>.</p>
<p>$80 billion in Treasury securities a month (with policy rates near 0%): represses short-term and long-term interest rates in general, and inflates asset prices and consumer prices, which <strong>further DESTROYS the purchasing power of the dollar</strong>.</p>
<p>TL:DR The Dollar losing purchasing power + Inflation = Permanent Loss of purchasing power.</p>
