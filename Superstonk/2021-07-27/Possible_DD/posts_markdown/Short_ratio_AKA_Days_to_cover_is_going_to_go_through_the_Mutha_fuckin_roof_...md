Hey guys, it's the short ratio guy here (Sarcasm implied.  Nobody calls me the short ratio guy and even if someone did, I think it's dumb to tell people your nickname.)   BUT ANYWHO.........I came across an interesting little tidbit about short ratios that just jacked my tits even harderer.   I haven't seen much talk about this but thought some wrinkle brains could add in their 2 cents.  

Short ratio or "days to cover" is a trading signal that could indicate a bearish sentiment in a stock or Bullish.   Short ratio is a very simple calculation.  

# Number of shares shorted / 3 month ADV.  

Based on previous filings and offerings, I know I'll be corrected but since these numbers are astronomical, so I'm just going to round off for easy math since nobody knows the true short % but people have speculated 200-900% and it grows every day with all the fuckery.  

Let's start with 200% and an estimated free float at a round number of 60m shares (I think it's around 58m but Fuck it for quick math).  The current 3 month ADV is almost 6m.  

Are your tits starting to tingle a little bit?  Do you feel. Wrinkle coming on? 

200% = 10 trading days to cover. (Ratio of 10)
400% = 20 trading days to cover. (Ratio of 20)
It's rounded simple math.  Continue to as high as you think the interest is.

We know retail owns the float.  Too much DD proving it.   We've seen the lowest trading days since 2017 in the past few days.  I just saw a DD where the highest volume in a single day during the January "shut off the buy button" fiasco was 197m in one day.  

This means apes are hodling.  Liquidity has dried up.   The longer the volume stays this low, the ratio changes.  Let's say with this 1.3m volume keeps up enough to drop it to 5m 3 month ADV.  

200% = 12 days
400% = 24 days

Let's drop it to 3m ADV.
200% = 20 days
400% = 40 days

Ho lee shit.  Now at the beginning I said this short ratio can be viewed bullish or bearish.  Under a bearish scenario, it means faith in a company and investor sentiment is falling.  Bad earnings, bad corporate direction, etc.  Toys R US would have had a very high short ratio when it went under.   But does this sound like a toys are us scenario?  Hells to the no.  Investor sentiment among retail and now even some states is super high.  Bullish as Fuck.  

TL;DR - the longer the illiquidity sticks around and volume stays bone dry, the obvious bullish short ratio is gonna keep rising backing SHF's further into their corners.  Also, you can read about it here - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Days to cover is a temporal indication of the short interest in a company's stock.

Days to cover is calculated by taking the quantity of shares that are currently sold short and dividing that amount by the stock's average daily trading volume.

A high days-to-cover measurement can signal a potential short squeeze.
