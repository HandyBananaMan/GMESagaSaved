<p>I may have found something kind of interesting today.</p>
<p>Ever since Gamestop secretly launched nft.gamestop.com I have been monitoring gamestop.com for new subdomains (using a python tool). I basically run the tool every few days and compare the output to the previous time I ran it and check for any differences. I hadn't ran it in a while (last time was July 15th, 2021) but I checked today and found an interesting new subdomain that appeared.  ipfs.nft.gamestop.com:</p>
<p><img alt="(script output for differences)" src="https://preview.redd.it/u5jzka3e9rd71.png?width=387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eed8bc86a730de0b97975270695c489d92121cbc" /></p>
<p><strong>What is IPFS?</strong></p>
<p>I have no clue I don't know much about blockchain/NFTs, I looked it up: Its the InterPlanetary Filesystem.</p>
<p>I found this page on minting an NFT with IPFS,  <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/mint-nfts-with-ipfs/">here</a>  the "How IPFS Helps" section is interesting. From what I understand it is a way of linking an NFT to a digital file, but using that digital file's hash as a content identifier (CID) which is then linked in the NFT contract. Since the CID contains the file's hash, the NFT will always lead to that exact copy of the file. I believe most of the artwork sold as NFTs nowadays are using IPFS.</p>
<p><strong>So why is this subdomain just showing up now?</strong></p>
<p>Is it new? I am not really sure.. It's the first time the script saw it.</p>
<p>I went back and looked at the original NFT contract which had an IPFS address in it:</p>

<p>Which you can also view via this link using the ipfs subdomain: <a href="https://ipfs.nft.gamestop.com/ipfs/QmaLEchFaE7FWhc4MCvYMqoTdK8rV1yfjEC5Bz4jzQRbjS">https://ipfs.nft.gamestop.com/ipfs/QmaLEchFaE7FWhc4MCvYMqoTdK8rV1yfjEC5Bz4jzQRbjS</a>  With IPFS you can host public gateways which is basically a place for a company to host files for their customers to easily access without needing an IPFS supported application (this way apes can see it in a browser I think?).</p>
<p><a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/</a> has a running list of current public gateways, some are companies that host files on blockchain for their partners/customers, gamestop is not listed (yet?).</p>
<p><strong>New Sub-Domains</strong></p>

<p>Purely speculation and not even sure if this is anything new, but if it is something new then maybe they are getting ready to test a digital games marketplace hosted on block chain? Where using NFT tokens we can digitally own a game (through IPFS) and not just the license to play one. I am not super knowledgeable in this area but it's interesting the script just started picking it up, and its timely considering they just released that new newsletter subdomain as well.</p>
<p><em>Comments from me</em></p>
<p>this appears interesting as it show a potential development path for gme and signs of what is to come in the future. this could be trading of owned digital games or it could be stocks or anything. needless to say my tittys are jacking further than before and im hyped about the future of the company. all of this is without moass and just goes to show that gme has great long term value. maybe some other computer apes could do some digging to find out what this means and jack our tits higher.</p>

<p>TLDR: New url created for gamestop nft pointing to potential further uses.</p>
<p>EDIT. THANKS FOR THE AWARDS AND KARMA BUT I DIDN’T WRITE IT.  PLEASE FIND A POST BY u/hooper359 via his history and GIVE ALL AWARDS AND KARMA ON THAT AS HE NEEDS KARMA TO EVEN COMMENT ON THIS POST.  thanks</p>

<p>For u/hooper359 (and everyone else):</p>
<p>The NFT launched on 14 July with minimal fanfare.</p>
<p>Later, one of the GameStop crypto developers commented on social media that the date was supposed to align with the planned transition to E t h e r e u m's London hard fork, which has key improvements in how E t h e r e u m handles ERC-271 tokens like this single GME token.</p>
<p>The London hard fork is now expected to happen on 4 August, which is just over one week from now.</p>

<p>This IPFS subdomain looks like it was launched right as the network is becoming more hospitable for creating a digital secondary market for videogame ownership.</p>
<p>EDIT: here's a comment, with a link to Matt Firestone's tweet about the GME NFT dates. This comment from u/daronjay explains how the GME NFT launch was related to this E t h e r e u m London hard fork because it will improve the speed and cost of transactions across the digital ledger.</p>
