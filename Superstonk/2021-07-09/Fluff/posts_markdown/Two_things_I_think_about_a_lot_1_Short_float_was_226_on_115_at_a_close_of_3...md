#Title: Two things I think about a lot: 1. Short float was 226% on 1/15 at a close of $37.19, it hasnâ€™t closed that low since. 2. When brokerages turned off the buy button, the price started dropping. If they were covering short positions, the price wouldâ€™ve kept going up. All. Shorts. Must. Cover.ðŸš€
