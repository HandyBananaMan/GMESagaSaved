As before, you can find the current DD image in multiple formats here at my GitHub repo - [https://github.com/schismsaints/GME\\_NFT](https://github.com/schismsaints/GME_NFT)\n\nTo start, if you aren't familiar with basic blockchain concepts, [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of20ou/a_deep_dive_into_nftgamestopcom/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ofndb0/a_crypto_dive_with_the_jellyfish_10_things_about) from /u/Dismal-Jellyfish (seriously, it's well worth a read) will help get you up to speed on the different token types, smart contracts, and other general blockchain concepts.\n\n**An Update on GME Tokens**\n\nEdit: Mandatory disclaimer - *don't be a dummy and buy random alt coins that just happen to say 'GameStop', you're almost certainly getting scammed*\n\n* [ERC-20 GameStop.finance scam token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9eb6be354d88fd88795a04de899a57a77c545590) \\- Obvious scam is obvious, but finding this token gave me a link to be able to more conclusively debunk the 69,420,000 ERC-20 token\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcf7cmqnr7a71.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e2a7928d64cbbfc523ab59b7ade084dba3eef4\n\n[\\\\\"The missing link\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ami03a1ur7a71.png?width=249&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c594892dfb607b865f03f9ef8f28755837fe9d)\n\n* [ERC-20 GME GameStop Token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5b7d043ecb3a694069cc01e763159ea1bde0541d) \\- Thanks to several of the commenters on my last post(s), I went through a deeper dive into the ERC-20 GME ('fake 1337420' address) token and agree that it is likely a scam.\n   * The two most solid pieces of evidence identifying the scam are:\n      * [0xfoobar directly disputing its validity](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1409740353738096641?s=21)\n      * [More than one address holding the confirmed scam token as well as this one](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xfb5484a510c48c307fd0253ee4d0a0866950f9a3)\n   * [There is one address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f8c1877ed0da352f78be4fe4cda58bb804a30df) which has ties to some potentially relevant blockchain companies (Cudo primarily) that had me doubting early on whether it was a scam, but on further research I've found a lot of links to Nigeria, Dubai, etc which, while not red flags in and of themselves, certainly don't line up with GameStop corporate hiring their own domestic blockchain team.\n\n[Largest single GME ERC-20 Token holder address](https://preview.redd.it/1wimkjrp48a71.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=313c9516cfef292f5a4570e971a292ddce3810f7)\n\n* [ERC-20 GME Coin Token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd4596454a0e145842d1319d6921399e8e1622ad7) \\- I have identified [an external account](https://etherscan.io/address/0x503828976d22510aad0201ac7ec88293211d23da) involved in funding the GME Coin address, but the trail went cold after that.  I can't confirm or deny that it is legitimate at this point; in either event, whoever created it went through more effort to hide their tracks than the other tokens.  It does not appear to have been sold/swapped anywhere as of yet. \n   * Edit: Listed on Uniswap, scam city most likely here as well\n* [ERC-721 GME GameStop Token (\"The One and Only\")](https://etherscan.io/token/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e) \\- I suspect this will be the only one of its kind minted, either as a teaser or POC token for further NFT work.\n   * One interesting possibility came to mind that - while not a crypto dividend per-se - could still have some interesting applications to securities exchanges or implications for the MOASS.  Caution: Speculation/theorycrafting inbound\n      * Consider the scenario involved with shareholder voting, where each shareholder receives a control number on each brokerage where they hold shares.  Each control number is associated with the number of shares held at a point in time snapshot.\n      * With ERC-721 or ERC-1155, a unique NFT could be minted for each shareholder/control number.  The number of shares associated with each NFT could either be held in an external DB or as metadata (a field on the token itself).\n      * This would create a public record of the number of shares held by individual shareholders at a point in time and could be updated on an annual basis (or more frequently if desired) in line with shareholder voting standards.\n      * This also avoids the 'crypto dividend' hangups associated with Overstock as there isn't any money involved nor is there any way this method could prevent legitimate short selling - it's merely a public ledger of shares in circulation.\n   * Alternatively, if they do a crypto coin dividend instead of a crypto stock dividend like Overstock, presumably they wouldn't place the same restrictions on selling which was the main point of contention in the Overstock case as I understand it.  See below for some reading on Overstock.\n      * [https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/overstock-is-paying-a-digital-dividend-and-it-gets-really-interesting-now-15037958](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/overstock-is-paying-a-digital-dividend-and-it-gets-really-interesting-now-15037958)\n      * [https://www.irmagazine.com/technology-social-media/how-overstock-used-blockchain-distribute-its-digital-dividend](https://www.irmagazine.com/technology-social-media/how-overstock-used-blockchain-distribute-its-digital-dividend)\n\n/u/No-Fox-1400 has a lot of the same thoughts I do in his posts here:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ofiev4/the\\_man\\_with\\_the\\_plan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ofiev4/the_man_with_the_plan/)\n   * The timeline here including Overstock was an excellent read, but the part I really want to call out is this\n\n[This is in line with my thoughts on timing - NFT platform launch on 7\\/14, announcement of dividend\\/crypto play on 7\\/14, and record date for a crypto based dividend on 7\\/24](https://preview.redd.it/olsculkf38a71.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbdaefd50c398f333896a14a204bafaa79334fd2)\n\n* And here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ocvqlp/the\\_rules\\_dont\\_matter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ocvqlp/the_rules_dont_matter/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89f8rnnw38a71.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=edc369dbfdb253baf183cdf837c9f725610a5a58\n\nEdit: The 7/14 date's significance has been potentially debunked\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of apes cried out in terror and had their tits suddenly deflated](https://preview.redd.it/38ex38jzh9a71.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8bc7969700a59428e93a0cdc90934ef3fa433c2)\n\nThis is a great post from /u/Hey_Madie that goes into more detail on EIP-1559 and this tweet\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oh7ugx/an\\_explanation\\_of\\_launchdate\\_714\\_nft\\_eip1559/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oh7ugx/an_explanation_of_launchdate_714_nft_eip1559/)\n\n**Recent Activity**\n\n/u/clawesome and /u/nuclear-falcon noticed some recent activity on the original smart contract here\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogjbcy/one\\_of\\_the\\_addresses\\_associated\\_with\\_the\\_gamestop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogjbcy/one_of_the_addresses_associated_with_the_gamestop/)\n\nI've drawn out these relations on the long format diagram, shown below\n\n[Adding approving parties\\/other devs to the owner\\/approval list](https://preview.redd.it/507nrqd258a71.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=26992c61f9346de0a90cc46bea65c17011018810)\n\nHuge credit to /u/HandyBananaMan for being almost as obsessed with the transaction logs as me and pointing me toward several bread crumbs along the way.\n\nTL:DR; Buy, Hold, Buckle Up.  GME Blockchain team hard at work to bring us something mind blowing.  I expect that *even if* a crypto dividend does not materialize, the [nft.gamestop.com](https://nft.gamestop.com) project will be revolutionary and will function as a large catalyst for price movement regardless of a dividend play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This is the PNG format of the diagram here for convenience, but the current version is always on my GitHub repo.](https://preview.redd.it/i09xoc4e78a71.png?width=4808&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f646219e746517c83364692af14e96180906d6)",
