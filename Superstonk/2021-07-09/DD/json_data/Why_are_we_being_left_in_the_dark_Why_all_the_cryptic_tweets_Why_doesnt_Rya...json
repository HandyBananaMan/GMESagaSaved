    "selftext": "January bag holder here. We used to talk about this more in the other subs and I felt like it was common knowledge. I\u2019m not smart enough to have research this myself but I looked it up again because there seems to be a lot of shit talking and confusion. \n\nRyan Cohen and RC Ventures entered into a Standstill Agreement on January 10, 2021 that has a long list of provisions that essentially prohibits him from speaking out directly. \n\nSpecifically, he is not allowed to influence voting or board votes and another long list of activities until about March 1, 2022. \n\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119380521000031/e620202_ex99-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119380521000031/e620202_ex99-1.htm)\n\nSo for everyone wondering why things are quiet, this is why. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal. \n\nThis week sucked. Next week is uncertain. The DTC/other colluders rules we\u2019ve been waiting for don\u2019t appear to have made a difference in hedge fund fuckery. We took a beating. \n\nI bought my first share at $350. I held to $38. \n\nI want tendies. But I\u2019m not fucking leaving over this. Never. I\u2019m out when the share price looks big for Kenny and his pals, not when it looks big to me. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019m selling. \n\nAnd you know what? I trust Ryan Cohen. I know he has a plan. I know he will do right by us. \n\nHe isn\u2019t talking to us because he can\u2019t. But he is communicating. And it\u2019s going to be fine. Better than fine. It\u2019s going to be fucking glorious. Life altering. \n\nIt\u2019s coming. Changing corrupt financial systems and taking down evil villains ain\u2019t easy. That\u2019s why super hero\u2019s have movies about them. Shits hard. \n\nIt\u2019s Friday. Go fuck off. Have a tasty beverage. Get some sun on your face this weekend. Get laid if there is someone who will enthusiastically consent to fucking you. Or just willingly consent. \n\nTomorrow is a new week. NFT week. Could be nothing. Could be everything. Everything is coming. \n\nIn the meantime, dream your dreams about what you\u2019re going to do with your tendies. \n\nI\u2019m fixing this fucking planet I love so much. Apes are going to find a solution for climate change. I\u2019m going to be a part of that movement. I\u2019m making my plans. \n\nYou do you. There\u2019s lots of broken shit in this fucked up system. \n\nCome back Monday ready to hype. \n\nTL;DR: Papa Cohen can\u2019t say anything publicly until around March 1, 2022. \n\nWen moon? Soon moon.\n\n\nEdit to add: because I am spelling everything out\u2026.remember, Kenny and his buddies aren\u2019t going down easily or we\u2019d all be rich by now. \n\nEverything needs to be above board so that GameStop and RC don\u2019t get sued. I\u2019m sure they will get sued but the goal is to not have anything substantive behind it. \n\nHe also has to watch what he says to the SEC doesn\u2019t get him for market manipulation. He has to watch his mouth to protect us and protect our tendies. \n\nElon has gotten in trouble for this. And RC is smarter than Elon so he is walking a finer line.\n\n\nSecond edit: some of you seem to think the Standstill Agreement ends after he became \ud83e\ude91\ud83d\udc68. It does not and if it\u2019s amended or changed it would be filed with the SEC. \n\nThe Standstill Agreement protects GameStop from a hostile takeover. Hostile takeovers of corporate boards are a whole other post. This is a not so hostile takeover. \n\nOther chairman and CEOs can speak out because they didn\u2019t buy shares to join a company. They don\u2019t have Standstill agreements.",
