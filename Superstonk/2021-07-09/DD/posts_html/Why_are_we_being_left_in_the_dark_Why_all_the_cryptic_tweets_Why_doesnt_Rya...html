<p>January bag holder here. We used to talk about this more in the other subs and I felt like it was common knowledge. Iâ€™m not smart enough to have research this myself but I looked it up again because there seems to be a lot of shit talking and confusion. </p>
<p>Ryan Cohen and RC Ventures entered into a Standstill Agreement on January 10, 2021 that has a long list of provisions that essentially prohibits him from speaking out directly. </p>
<p>Specifically, he is not allowed to influence voting or board votes and another long list of activities until about March 1, 2022. </p>

<p>So for everyone wondering why things are quiet, this is why. </p>
<p>Hereâ€™s the deal. </p>
<p>This week sucked. Next week is uncertain. The DTC/other colluders rules weâ€™ve been waiting for donâ€™t appear to have made a difference in hedge fund fuckery. We took a beating. </p>
<p>I bought my first share at $350. I held to $38. </p>
<p>I want tendies. But Iâ€™m not fucking leaving over this. Never. Iâ€™m out when the share price looks big for Kenny and his pals, not when it looks big to me. Thatâ€™s the only way Iâ€™m selling. </p>
<p>And you know what? I trust Ryan Cohen. I know he has a plan. I know he will do right by us. </p>
<p>He isnâ€™t talking to us because he canâ€™t. But he is communicating. And itâ€™s going to be fine. Better than fine. Itâ€™s going to be fucking glorious. Life altering. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s coming. Changing corrupt financial systems and taking down evil villains ainâ€™t easy. Thatâ€™s why super heroâ€™s have movies about them. Shits hard. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s Friday. Go fuck off. Have a tasty beverage. Get some sun on your face this weekend. Get laid if there is someone who will enthusiastically consent to fucking you. Or just willingly consent. </p>
<p>Tomorrow is a new week. NFT week. Could be nothing. Could be everything. Everything is coming. </p>
<p>In the meantime, dream your dreams about what youâ€™re going to do with your tendies. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m fixing this fucking planet I love so much. Apes are going to find a solution for climate change. Iâ€™m going to be a part of that movement. Iâ€™m making my plans. </p>
<p>You do you. Thereâ€™s lots of broken shit in this fucked up system. </p>
<p>Come back Monday ready to hype. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Papa Cohen canâ€™t say anything publicly until around March 1, 2022. </p>
<p>Wen moon? Soon moon.</p>
<p>Edit to add: because I am spelling everything outâ€¦.remember, Kenny and his buddies arenâ€™t going down easily or weâ€™d all be rich by now. </p>
<p>Everything needs to be above board so that GameStop and RC donâ€™t get sued. Iâ€™m sure they will get sued but the goal is to not have anything substantive behind it. </p>
<p>He also has to watch what he says to the SEC doesnâ€™t get him for market manipulation. He has to watch his mouth to protect us and protect our tendies. </p>
<p>Elon has gotten in trouble for this. And RC is smarter than Elon so he is walking a finer line.</p>
<p>Second edit: some of you seem to think the Standstill Agreement ends after he became ðŸª‘ðŸ‘¨. It does not and if itâ€™s amended or changed it would be filed with the SEC. </p>
<p>The Standstill Agreement protects GameStop from a hostile takeover. Hostile takeovers of corporate boards are a whole other post. This is a not so hostile takeover. </p>
<p>Other chairman and CEOs can speak out because they didnâ€™t buy shares to join a company. They donâ€™t have Standstill agreements.</p>
