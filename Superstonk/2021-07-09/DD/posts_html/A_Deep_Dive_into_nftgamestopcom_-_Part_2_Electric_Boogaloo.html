<p>You might remember me from my reddit hits such as "Why does AutoMod hate everything I do?", or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of20ou/a_deep_dive_into_nftgamestopcom/">my most recent post from a couple of days ago</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to update my previous DD with some recent findings, clearing up a few points as well as expanding on the research I've done thus far.  As before, you can find the current DD image in multiple formats here at my GitHub repo - <a href="https://github.com/schismsaints/GME_NFT">https://github.com/schismsaints/GME_NFT</a></p>
<p>To start, if you aren't familiar with basic blockchain concepts, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of20ou/a_deep_dive_into_nftgamestopcom/">my previous post</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ofndb0/a_crypto_dive_with_the_jellyfish_10_things_about">this one</a> from /u/Dismal-Jellyfish (seriously, it's well worth a read) will help get you up to speed on the different token types, smart contracts, and other general blockchain concepts.</p>
<p><strong>An Update on GME Tokens</strong></p>
<p>Edit: Mandatory disclaimer - <em>don't be a dummy and buy random alt coins that just happen to say 'GameStop', you're almost certainly getting scammed</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x9eb6be354d88fd88795a04de899a57a77c545590">ERC-20 GameStop.finance scam token</a> - Obvious scam is obvious, but finding this token gave me a link to be able to more conclusively debunk the 69,420,000 ERC-20 token</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x5b7d043ecb3a694069cc01e763159ea1bde0541d">ERC-20 GME GameStop Token</a> - Thanks to several of the commenters on my last post(s), I went through a deeper dive into the ERC-20 GME ('fake 1337420' address) token and agree that it is likely a scam.</li>
<li>The two most solid pieces of evidence identifying the scam are:<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1409740353738096641?s=21">0xfoobar directly disputing its validity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0xfb5484a510c48c307fd0253ee4d0a0866950f9a3">More than one address holding the confirmed scam token as well as this one</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f8c1877ed0da352f78be4fe4cda58bb804a30df">There is one address</a> which has ties to some potentially relevant blockchain companies (Cudo primarily) that had me doubting early on whether it was a scam, but on further research I've found a lot of links to Nigeria, Dubai, etc which, while not red flags in and of themselves, certainly don't line up with GameStop corporate hiring their own domestic blockchain team.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/1wimkjrp48a71.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=313c9516cfef292f5a4570e971a292ddce3810f7">Largest single GME ERC-20 Token holder address</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xd4596454a0e145842d1319d6921399e8e1622ad7">ERC-20 GME Coin Token</a> - I have identified <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x503828976d22510aad0201ac7ec88293211d23da">an external account</a> involved in funding the GME Coin address, but the trail went cold after that.  I can't confirm or deny that it is legitimate at this point; in either event, whoever created it went through more effort to hide their tracks than the other tokens.  It does not appear to have been sold/swapped anywhere as of yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e">ERC-721 GME GameStop Token ("The One and Only")</a> - I suspect this will be the only one of its kind minted, either as a teaser or POC token for further NFT work.</li>
<li>One interesting possibility came to mind that - while not a crypto dividend per-se - could still have some interesting applications to securities exchanges or implications for the MOASS.  Caution: Speculation/theorycrafting inbound<ul>
<li>Consider the scenario involved with shareholder voting, where each shareholder receives a control number on each brokerage where they hold shares.  Each control number is associated with the number of shares held at a point in time snapshot.</li>
<li>With ERC-721 or ERC-1155, a unique NFT could be minted for each shareholder/control number.  The number of shares associated with each NFT could either be held in an external DB or as metadata (a field on the token itself).</li>
<li>This would create a public record of the number of shares held by individual shareholders at a point in time and could be updated on an annual basis (or more frequently if desired) in line with shareholder voting standards.</li>
<li>This also avoids the 'crypto dividend' hangups associated with Overstock as there isn't any money involved nor is there any way this method could prevent legitimate short selling - it's merely a public ledger of shares in circulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternatively, if they do a crypto coin dividend instead of a crypto stock dividend like Overstock, presumably they wouldn't place the same restrictions on selling which was the main point of contention in the Overstock case as I understand it.  See below for some reading on Overstock.<ul>

<li>The timeline here including Overstock was an excellent read, but the part I really want to call out is this</li>

<p>Edit: The 7/14 date's significance has been potentially debunked</p>

<p><strong>Recent Activity</strong></p>
<p>/u/clawesome and /u/nuclear-falcon noticed some recent activity on the original smart contract here</p>

<p>I've drawn out these relations on the long format diagram, shown below</p>

<p>Huge credit to /u/HandyBananaMan for being almost as obsessed with the transaction logs as me and pointing me toward several bread crumbs along the way.</p>
<p>TL:DR; Buy, Hold, Buckle Up.  GME Blockchain team hard at work to bring us something mind blowing.  I expect that <em>even if</em> a crypto dividend does not materialize, the <a href="https://nft.gamestop.com">nft.gamestop.com</a> project will be revolutionary and will function as a large catalyst for price movement regardless of a dividend play.</p>
