Yes, NFTs and crypto shit is cool, but lets not forget the entire financial system is held together with string and shitty glue.

JPOW and every crook under the sun has their dicks caught up in a system so unimaginably fucked, we'll be living with the fallout of the next collapse into our fucking 50s, 60s and 70s.

It is unraveling right before our eyes. The wrinklies have foreseen it.

It will come undone anytime between now and September.
