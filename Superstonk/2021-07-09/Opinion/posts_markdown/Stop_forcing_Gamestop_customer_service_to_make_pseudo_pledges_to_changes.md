Look I understand giving ideas to a company you love. I understand you probably think the introduction of your favorite sock puppets to Gamestop will soar their revenue next quarter. I've been noticing a trend around here lately it looks something like this:


Superstonk Fan: Gamestop you should really branch out into catheters! My grandpa needs one all the time it could be an amazing business addition!


Gamestop Representative: Uuhh yeah great idea, we will absolutely make sure that gets to the right department!


Superstonk Fan: *posts Instagram screenshot to r/superstonk* Look everyone Gamestop said they're going to sell Catheters soon!! I love this company!

The comments then proceed to just be an echo chamber of false expectations for Gamestop to branch into some weird niche sector. You're raising expectations and hopes for the purpose of what? Karma farming? Make your suggestions, and keep them between you and the company. If you made the suggestion for the good of the company there is no need to flaunt their response as some sort of **BIG WIN** for GME shareholders.


**EDIT:** Just wanted to add a note after the fact since this gained some traction. I love Gamestop, I love the journey they are taking us on, and I love the GME shareholders. This company has single handedly changed my life forever and I sincerely want the same for every single one of you. This is not a FUD attempt merely a gauging of sentiment towards a particular trend arising. Thank you, Buy some more GME today yeah?

**EDIT 2:** Alright to those who felt personally attacked by this post, sorry but it had to be said. I am done responding for now, boss will probably notice I'm not working soon. Need elaboration? Check the comment section. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

**FINAL EDIT:** Just got off work, what a fun day talking to you all. I appreciate the corroborating opinions, as well as the dissenting ones. If you feel my open conversation on an arising trend within the community was FUD or in any way malicious, I assure you that was not the intent. I'm happy for those who picked up on the hyperbole to add levity to the situation, and enjoyed the jokes. My post was not about cutting communication with Gamestop, rather the abuse of a dedicated sub to proctor small village sized echo chambers of support to a single business proposition and have it broadcasted to half a million users on slow news days. A 2k upvoted business idea about gamestop pizza is not a generally accepted idea from the sub just because the sub was slow when it gets pushed up. Have a good weekend everyone, next week should be fun!
