<p>In order for the French Revolution of the Stock Market to be beyond rebuke, there can be no shortcuts or cutting corners. As such, Gamestop will, in all likelihood, transform its business <em>first</em> by integrating blockchain technology into the fabric of its being. Any crypto dividend will come <em>after</em> such implementation of blockchain and NFT's into its business structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Overstock litigation indicates that the purpose of a crypto dividend cannot be to force the shorts to cover. <strong>There must be a legitimate business purpose.</strong> Where the line is drawn between the two and how they are weighted is anyone's guess, and why I believe Gamestop will ensure that any crypto dividend merely rides on the coattails of the blockchain/NFT transformation it will have already substantially completed. Luckily for Gamestop, the building blocks are already there -- digital character skins, trading cards, any number of collectibles, second-hand gaming market, etc. etc. etc. -- they just need to develop the infrastructure and implement the technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of Overstock, the company had been involved in the crypto/blockchain for 5 years before issuing its crypto dividend AND it had subsidiary companies that were wholly devoted to the development of blockchain technology and a platform for trading digital securities. <em>The issuance of the crypto dividend was directly tied and perfectly synergized with its stated business transformation and the tZero digital trading platform.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As much as I'd love to see MOASS sooner rather than later, I do not foresee a crypto dividend coming on July 14. I believe we should "Buckle Up" for the long haul.</p>

<p>RC is playing chess, not checkers. He isn't just saving a sinking ship (that's already been accomplished here); he is, with hand-selected team, inventing the steam engine, while all the other companies are still using sails or horseback riding. For all my fellow Civ or history nerds out there, you know how revolutionary the steam engine was for the Industrial Revolution. And in a world that is increasingly becoming more virtual/digital, Gamestop is, in my humble opinion, leading the charge on the next revolution in the digital and pixelated world -- giving Power to the Players, Power to the Collectors, and Power to the Creators.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
Gamestop is not the new Blockbuster; it is more the new Overstock (kind of). However, unlike Overstock, Gamestop's business is focused on a sector that seems to perfectly dovetail with the blockchain/nft/crypto universe -- Gaming, Collectibles, Memes, Nerdgasm stuff. The gaming industry is already estimated to be a $150B+ industry. And we haven't even reached widespread virtual reality or whatever else the pixel magicians may create.</p>
<p>Gamestop is poised to learn the lessons from the Overstock pivot and the lawsuit that followed. Unlike Overstock, Gamestop has a never before seen diehard following of shareholders and customers. It is best summed up by Larry Cheng's tweet:
"Every company is a company. However, on rare occasion, some companies become movements. The company ends up standing for something much larger and more significant than itself. These companies break the traditional paradigm - they can play chess when everyone else plays checkers."</p>
<p>However, with becoming a movement and having such a loyal following comes a downside: the increased potential for any crypto dividend to look like it is to appease the shareholders (which it <em>per se</em> does) but also in a sense of quenching any vindictive thirst by the shareholders or the company itself against short sellers. As such, Gamestop must play Chess, not checkers.</p>
<p>The Wild West of law and Technology collide in the blockchain/NFT/crypto space. Simply put, there isn't enough legal precedent out there to indicate what is and is not permissible. If you're playing chess, you're using what precedent is available (which isn't much) to plan. And you're ensuring that your business transformation and approach to bringing in shareholders (such as a dividend) is beyond reproach.</p>
<p>The Overstock lawsuit -- Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd. v. Overstock.com, Inc. (In re Overstock Sec. Litig), Case No. -- is the only direct legal precedent we have in the matter of a public company issuing a crypto dividend.</p>
<p>A review of the case can help us learn what <em>one</em> federal district court thought on the matter, whether in the law and analysis that applied or the dicta (non-legally binding reflections of the court) that the court wrote on the matter. Such a review reflects that the law is nebulous (surprise...) and the Court's underlying reasoning focused on the <em>reason</em> for Overstock issuing the crypto dividend. The short of it is: to the extent that the purpose of Overstock's crypto dividend would appear to be to cause a short-squeeze, it would be improper.</p>
<p><strong>Background of Overstock's business and pivot into the Blockchain and Crypto world:</strong>
As we know, Overstock was and is a home goods and furnishings retailer, particularly in the e-commerce sector. With falling profits and in a field that proved to be dwindling, Patrick Byrne (founder and then-CEO of Overstock) sought to pivot the business into something new. As a big proponent of blockchain and crypto, Byrne sought to get Overstock into this burgeoning and quickly developing new technology -- a technology that some have characterized as revolutionary as the internet itself.</p>
<p><strong>Overstock Case Background:</strong>
[Court Order on Overstock's Motion to Dismiss] (https://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1071/O00_01/2020928_r01x_19CV00709.pdf)</p>
<p>The Order addresses multiple claims asserted by the Plaintiffs, but this background will focus merely on that of the Crypto Dividend. However, do be aware that the narrative crafted by the Plaintiffs seeks to link the Crypto Dividend into the broader claims, particularly against Patrick Byrne. Plaintiffs claims would have been significantly weaker had they not tied into each other.</p>
<p>The main Parties:
* Defendant -- Overstock</p>
<p>*"Lead Plaintiff The Mangrove Partners is an institutional investor that purchased Overstock common stock during the class period. Plaintiff is a well-known short seller, and Dr. Byrne [Overstock's then CEO] publicly denounced short sellers for artificially depressing Overstock’s share price." </p>
<p><strong>Background on Overstock's crypto dividend and the observed effects of same:</strong>
(direct language from the Order):
In 2014, Overstock began working on initiatives to develop blockchain technologies, which it now pursues through its wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures, Inc. Medici conducts the majority of its business through a subsidiary, tZERO Group, Inc., which is focused on developing and supporting the issuance of digital
securities. Through tZERO, Overstock sought to create an alternative trading platform where the investing public could purchase and trade digital securities.</p>
<p>on July 30, 2019, Overstock announced that it would issue a dividend of one share of Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred Stock for every 10 shares of common or preferred stock outstanding.</p>
<p>Once eligible for resale, the shares would be traded through a brokerage account established with Dinosaur Financial Group LLC (“Dino”) on PRO Securities ATS, a SEC-registered alternative trading system operated by PRO Securities, a tZERO subsidiary. </p>
<p>Within hours of its announcement, several market-focused publications recognized the practical effect of the Dividend on short sellers.</p>
<p><strong>--Recap--</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Overstock had been involved in the blockchain tech for 5 years prior to announcing the issuance of a crypto dividend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was readily apparent to everyone in the industry as to what the effect of a crypto dividend would be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overstocks crypto dividend was to be traded on the tZero platform, which is owned by a company that is a subsidiary of tZero, which is a subsidiary of Medici, which is in turn a subsidiary of Overstock. <strong>So, the crypto dividend was intended to facilitate the use and growth of an alternative trading platform that Overstock, in effect, owned.</strong> (<em>THIS IS IMPORTANT</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Allegation by Plaintiff (direct language from Order):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Plaintiffs allege that Defendants made false statements about
Overstock’s financial projections for 2019 and engineered a scheme to issue a digital dividend that purportedly caused an artificial short-squeeze.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Essentially, Plaintiff contends that Defendants engaged in a scheme to issue a locked-up dividend they knew would cause a short squeeze, artificially spike Overstock’s stock price, and force short sellers of Overstock stock to cover their positions at inflated prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Count 2, Plaintiff alleges a market manipulation claim with respect to Defendants’ issuance of the digital dividend that would be paid to Overstock shareholders in tZERO shares. According to Plaintiff, because short sellers with borrowed shares would have to purchase Overstock common stock to repay the lender the digital dividend in advance of the dividend date, Defendants caused an artificial short squeeze “manipulating” an increase in share price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although Overstock stated that the Dividend was important for adoption of the tZERO platform and to bring broker-dealers into the broader tZERO ecosystem, Plaintiff claims thatOverstock’s stated goal was pretextual. Plaintiff contends that the dividend was announced shortly after Dr. Byrne learned that his relationship with a Russian spy was about to be come public and he might need to leave the company. Plaintiff believes that the dividend’s short squeeze was intended to increase the price of Overstock shares at the time of Dr. Byrne’s departure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Court's observations (language from the Order):</strong>
Byrne’s very public disdain for short sellers is beside the point because there was a <strong>legitimate business purpose</strong> for issuing the dividend. While Byrne, like any CEO of a public company that is heavily shorted, would want to reduce the downward pressure those shorts exerted on his company’s stock price, there is no evidence that targeting short sellers was the purpose of the dividend. <strong>*Defendants state that Overstock was trying to transition from being a traditional online retailer to a blockchain technology business. The dividend was a creative way to strengthen that transition. Plaintiff has no evidence to overcome this legitimate business for issuing the dividend.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion and Opinion</strong>
Gamestop is playing chess. They want to transform their business with blockchain technology. While a retailer (right now), the goods and services they deal in (gaming/collectibles) are a perfect fit with blockchain technology. In the case of Overstock, that company was starting from scratch with blockchain/crypto. No one wants a digital NFT couch. But NFT gaming character skins, NFT second-hand gaming market, NFT trading cards (the Pokemon card trading microcosm is valued at half a Billion alone), among tons of other possibilities? Ya, the building blocks are already there for Gamestop. All they need to do is put them together -- Brick by Brick.</p>
<p>Ryan Cohen is a creator. He's not here to save a sinking ship and then bail; he's here to invent the steam engine and revolutionize the world -- the world of Players, Collectors, and Creators. While it's purely speculation on my part as are most things in this post, I assume Chewy will always be his baby, but Gamestop will be his legacy. Buckle Up.</p>
<p>If you're going to beat the corruption, you cannot cut corners. You cannot leave room for error. You cannot in anyway be impugned. Otherwise, you leave threads for others to pull on in legal battles and in the public eye.</p>
<p>As such, I think this could be a long(ish) haul. Gamestop is likely going to fully implement blockchain/NFT into the essence of its being before any digital dividend is issued. Recall that Overstock had been involved in Crypto/blockchain for 5 years before issuing its crypto dividend. <em>Further,</em> the issuance of its crypto dividend was directly linked to facilitating the use and growth of an alternative trading platform that it, in effect, owned. <em>"Legitimate Business Purpose."</em></p>
<p>Gamestop will ride the tide of speculation, hype, and FUD over its transformation. It will ride the tide of the market crash everyone but the mainstream media sees coming. And only then, once Gamestop has caused a paradigm shift as to the possibilities of how gaming and blockchain/nft's can be symbiotic, then maybe it will issue crypto dividends. It likely will want to have the framework -- both from a technological  (servers, development, etc.) and business perspective -- before issuing a crypto dividend. Further, the crypto dividend will likely line up with its very own blockchain transformation -- such that the crypto dividend directly ties in with its business model. Just like Overstock had its crypto dividend tie in with its alternative trading platform.</p>
<p>If such came to pass, it would be my humble opinion that a crypto dividend would withstand legal challenges. At this time, Gamestop does not (openly) have the involvement and investment into blockchain/crypto that Overstock had for 5 years. With the mainstream media putting targets on the back of Gamestop and Apes, it'd be wise to have the business transformation <em>first,</em> before issuing such a dividend.</p>
<p>Again, I'd like the MOASS ASAP as much as the next Ape. But I'd also want Gamestop to be unassailable in what it does. Negative Beta? Market Crash? Genuine delight by the investing public over Gamestop revolutionizing the virtual/pixel world? There are any number of things that could set off MOASS. The Ace in the Hole is the crypto dividend.</p>
<p>My hopes for 7/14 and the month-long Moonjam? That Gamestop announces something big about NFT/blockchain/crypto that provides the first peak into the transformation of the business, AND that its use is displayed for all to see during Moonjam. And all while having some pixelated blocks go to the moon (as some have speculated)? Ya, Bullish.</p>
<p>Power to the Players; Power to the Collectors; Power to the Creators.</p>
