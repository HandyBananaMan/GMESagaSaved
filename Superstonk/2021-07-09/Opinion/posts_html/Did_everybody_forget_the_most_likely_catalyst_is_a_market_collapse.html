<p>Yes, NFTs and crypto shit is cool, but lets not forget the entire financial system is held together with string and shitty glue.</p>
<p>JPOW and every crook under the sun has their dicks caught up in a system so unimaginably fucked, we'll be living with the fallout of the next collapse into our fucking 50s, 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>It is unraveling right before our eyes. The wrinklies have foreseen it.</p>
<p>It will come undone anytime between now and September.</p>
