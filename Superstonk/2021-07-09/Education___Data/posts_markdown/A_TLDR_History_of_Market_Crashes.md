In case you've been living under a rock, it's no news the market is due for a significant correction.

If you've found this DD, you've likely already absorbed all the other DD on & off of SuperStonk covering this topic, so I won't beat a dead horse.

I'm going to do my best to make this as bare bone and easy to understand as possible.

**The** [**S&P 500**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC) **just hit another ATH (All Time High) yesterday of $4,361.88 USD.**

In this little history lesson, we'll be making the final calculations under the basis that the current/ath price of the S&P 500 is a clean 4360.

&#x200B;

What is the S&P 500?

The **S&P 500** measures the value of the stocks of the **500**  largest corporations by market capitalization listed on the New York  Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Composite. The intention of Standard & Poor's is to have a price that provides a quick look at the stock market  and economy.

**There are 7 events** (not just crashes) **in stock market history that I'm going to touch on. We'll cover why they happened, how bad the market dropped** (using the S&P 500 as an overall market confidence/health indicator) **, how it impacted the world & how hard the stock market would take a hit if an event of that magnitude happened in the near future.**

Lets go.

# September 2020

The September 2020 Market Dip was said to be mostly caused due to major fears of a significant, COVID-19 Resurgence, causing economies to start shutting back down just as thing were starting to open back up. No noticeable changes in day to day life for the average earthling.

![Rough Dates: 02 Sep 2020 - 24 Sep 2020, S&P Dipped 10.3&#37; from \~$3580 to \~$3210 \(-$370\)](https://preview.redd.it/31e43ln974a71.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=031d61432106b6a10274c18fef9d6a64e78e419d)

&#x200B;

# 2018 Recession

The 2018 Market Recession is a period where investors confidence started to fall. Majorly influenced by the ex-president of the USA's trade war with China, Global Economic Growth Slowdown, & concern about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates too quickly. Average daily life mostly unchanged.

![Rough Dates: 03 Oct 2018 - 24 Dec 2018, S&P Dropped 20&#37; from \~$2930 to \~$2350 \(-$580\)](https://preview.redd.it/2435pewf94a71.png?width=1697&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc7c6c695fbd39fe3feab516269becde93169a8)

&#x200B;

# 1987 (Black Monday) Crash

The trade deficit of the USA was widening compared to other countries, tensions between Kuwait & Iran, & newly implemented computerized trading had increased volatility in the market (Basically computer thinks: Things are going up? Automatic buys. Going down? Automatic sells.) This all impacted investor confidence, & since the stock market was already experiencing a couple bad weeks going into Black Monday, once the losses started on 19 Oct 1987, everybody started panic selling. S&P had 20.5% losses in just that day alone. This triggered a global stock market decline ranging from \~20% to \~40% losses across most major exchanges, even \~45% on the Hong Kong exchange. A lot of brokers/bankers/financial industry professionals lost jobs, however the market immediately started another bull run which would last until the Dot.Com Bubble busted.

![Rough Dates: 5 Oct 1987 - 20 Oct 1987 \(The actual \\"Black Monday\\" was on 19 October '87, but the markets had been declining since the 5th of that month\), S&P Dropped 33.5&#37; from \~$328 to \~$218 \(-$110\)](https://preview.redd.it/4aphxtnfg7a71.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0770f856f622dec9ba4e25ab12e52734957c6b6)

# Covid Crash

Pandemic Time. Flash Crashes across the global markets. Millions newly unemployed, a major increase in homelessness. Not to mention a lot of dead friends, family, and neighbours. Major billionaires increase their value by a combined half a $TRILLION, while over 40Million Americans filed for unemployment & people were dropping dead in the streets of Italy.

![Rough Dates \(of the crash, not the entire pandemic, obviously\): 19 Feb 2020 - 23 Mar 2020, S&P fell 35.3&#37; from \~$3400 to \~$2200    \(-$1200\)](https://preview.redd.it/ybdgzwo9b4a71.png?width=1701&format=png&auto=webp&s=efb94d3d1850410cd0bcad6effe1ed5bf17ee496)

&#x200B;

# Dot.Com Bubble

Japan had entered a recession triggering a global sell off in March 2000 that hit tech stocks hard, a lot of internet based companies had been spending WAY too much on advertising rather than building their companies/products, which led to a lot of positive investor attention before a lot of these companies ultimately failed. 9/11 & various accounting scandals in significant public companies also helped attack investor confidence.  Several companies & executives were accused/convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders' money. Lots of layoffs of programmers & other computer based workers,  University enrolment for computer based disciplines also took a major hit.

![Rough Dates: 27 Mar 2000 - 10 Mar 2003, S&P tumbled 47.7&#37; from \~$1530 to \~$800 \(-$730\)](https://preview.redd.it/t570xjx6d4a71.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cd744981f4eb6b6aa8e1a08e2cbe3b3cf67546e)

# 2008 Financial Crisis

[Seriously, go watch The Big Short.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j13KSg4l9gM) Banks (& others) got very greedy and were taking insane risks. The housing bubble finally got a fair reset, & a lot of people in the western hemisphere are still feeling the ripples today. According to [some cute as fuck dog](https://www.reddit.com/user/Criand/posts/), it never ended.

![Rough Dates: 10 Oct 2007 - 09 Mar 2009, S&P crashed 56.7&#37; from \~$1570 to \~$680 \(-$890\)](https://preview.redd.it/yw4czjtue4a71.png?width=1695&format=png&auto=webp&s=3304ae28b8aa1e4fc737f02542c088e2ec3017c9)

# THE GREAT DEPRESSION

A SEVERE WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC DEPRESSION. Various countries felt it at various times, but it was mostly concentrated in the 1930s. It kicked off in the USA due to [Black Tuesday](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blacktuesday.asp), & continued through the 30s as retail consumer spending and investing dropped, & failing companies led to more & more jobs lost.  A significant amount of working class people worldwide were forced into homelessness & starvation due to lack of means to provide for themselves & their families.

![Rough Dates: 29 Oct 1929 - 11 July 1932, S&P perished 86.1&#37; from \~$31.8 to \~$4.4 \(-$27.4\)](https://preview.redd.it/6sqbzjlag4a71.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f835e4dee346adb6ae0d1a16556cfd0d649926d)
