Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes around the world! üëãü¶ç

Yesterday's early German market action led a high-volume charge into an early dip, but what a recovery! As the reverse-repo rates steadily creep upward, the banks are all making very curious moves such as closing accounts and lines of credit. It's almost like there's a liquidity crisis building, and increasing indications that it's about to blow up! Hmm... I wonder what might be the catalyst. Meanwhile, Apes continue to buy, HODL, and and await the MOASS.

Today is July 9th, and you know what that means! Let's enjoy the final Diamantenh√§nde thread before the weekend. Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange!

FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from a single German exchange and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.17896861. There are occasionally small differences in price that are below the rounding error to two decimal places, which can lead to colorful boxes without obvious price change. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or ![TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)

Many among the Diamantenh√§nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Over a week ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.

Diamantenh√§nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!
