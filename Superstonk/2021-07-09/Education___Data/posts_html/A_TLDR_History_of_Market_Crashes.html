<p>In case you've been living under a rock, it's no news the market is due for a significant correction.</p>
<p>If you've found this DD, you've likely already absorbed all the other DD on &amp; off of SuperStonk covering this topic, so I won't beat a dead horse.</p>
<p>I'm going to do my best to make this as bare bone and easy to understand as possible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC"><strong>S&amp;P 500</strong></a> <strong>just hit another ATH (All Time High) yesterday of $4,361.88 USD.</strong></p>
<p>In this little history lesson, we'll be making the final calculations under the basis that the current/ath price of the S&amp;P 500 is a clean 4360.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What is the S&amp;P 500?</p>
<p>The <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> measures the value of the stocks of the <strong>500</strong>  largest corporations by market capitalization listed on the New York  Stock Exchange or Nasdaq Composite. The intention of Standard &amp; Poor's is to have a price that provides a quick look at the stock market  and economy. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/what-does-sp-500-index-measure-and-how-it-calculated.asp">Source: Investopedia</a></p>
<p><strong>There are 7 events</strong> (not just crashes) <strong>in stock market history that I'm going to touch on. We'll cover why they happened, how bad the market dropped</strong> (using the S&amp;P 500 as an overall market confidence/health indicator) <strong>, how it impacted the world &amp; how hard the stock market would take a hit if an event of that magnitude happened in the near future.</strong></p>
<p>Lets go.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>September 2020</h1>
<p>The September 2020 Market Dip was said to be mostly caused due to major fears of a significant, COVID-19 Resurgence, causing economies to start shutting back down just as thing were starting to open back up. No noticeable changes in day to day life for the average earthling.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/31e43ln974a71.png?width=1691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=031d61432106b6a10274c18fef9d6a64e78e419d">Rough Dates: 02 Sep 2020 - 24 Sep 2020, S&amp;P Dipped 10.3&#37; from \~$3580 to \~$3210 (-$370)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>2018 Recession</h1>
<p>The 2018 Market Recession is a period where investors confidence started to fall. Majorly influenced by the ex-president of the USA's trade war with China, Global Economic Growth Slowdown, &amp; concern about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates too quickly. Average daily life mostly unchanged.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2435pewf94a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc7c6c695fbd39fe3feab516269becde93169a8">Rough Dates: 03 Oct 2018 - 24 Dec 2018, S&amp;P Dropped 20&#37; from \~$2930 to \~$2350 (-$580)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>1987 (Black Monday) Crash</h1>
<p>The trade deficit of the USA was widening compared to other countries, tensions between Kuwait &amp; Iran, &amp; newly implemented computerized trading had increased volatility in the market (Basically computer thinks: Things are going up? Automatic buys. Going down? Automatic sells.) This all impacted investor confidence, &amp; since the stock market was already experiencing a couple bad weeks going into Black Monday, once the losses started on 19 Oct 1987, everybody started panic selling. S&amp;P had 20.5% losses in just that day alone. This triggered a global stock market decline ranging from \~20% to \~40% losses across most major exchanges, even \~45% on the Hong Kong exchange. A lot of brokers/bankers/financial industry professionals lost jobs, however the market immediately started another bull run which would last until the Dot.Com Bubble busted.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/4aphxtnfg7a71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0770f856f622dec9ba4e25ab12e52734957c6b6">Rough Dates: 5 Oct 1987 - 20 Oct 1987 (The actual \"Black Monday\" was on 19 October '87, but the markets had been declining since the 5th of that month), S&amp;P Dropped 33.5&#37; from \~$328 to \~$218 (-$110)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Covid Crash</h1>
<p>Pandemic Time. Flash Crashes across the global markets. Millions newly unemployed, a major increase in homelessness. Not to mention a lot of dead friends, family, and neighbours. Major billionaires increase their value by a combined half a $TRILLION, while over 40Million Americans filed for unemployment &amp; people were dropping dead in the streets of Italy.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Dot.Com Bubble</h1>
<p>Japan had entered a recession triggering a global sell off in March 2000 that hit tech stocks hard, a lot of internet based companies had been spending WAY too much on advertising rather than building their companies/products, which led to a lot of positive investor attention before a lot of these companies ultimately failed. 9/11 &amp; various accounting scandals in significant public companies also helped attack investor confidence.  Several companies &amp; executives were accused/convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders' money. Lots of layoffs of programmers &amp; other computer based workers,  University enrolment for computer based disciplines also took a major hit.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/t570xjx6d4a71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cd744981f4eb6b6aa8e1a08e2cbe3b3cf67546e">Rough Dates: 27 Mar 2000 - 10 Mar 2003, S&amp;P tumbled 47.7&#37; from \~$1530 to \~$800 (-$730)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>2008 Financial Crisis</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j13KSg4l9gM">Seriously, go watch The Big Short.</a> Banks (&amp; others) got very greedy and were taking insane risks. The housing bubble finally got a fair reset, &amp; a lot of people in the western hemisphere are still feeling the ripples today. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Criand/posts/">some cute as fuck dog</a>, it never ended.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/yw4czjtue4a71.png?width=1695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3304ae28b8aa1e4fc737f02542c088e2ec3017c9">Rough Dates: 10 Oct 2007 - 09 Mar 2009, S&amp;P crashed 56.7&#37; from \~$1570 to \~$680 (-$890)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>THE GREAT DEPRESSION</h1>
<p>A SEVERE WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC DEPRESSION. Various countries felt it at various times, but it was mostly concentrated in the 1930s. It kicked off in the USA due to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blacktuesday.asp">Black Tuesday</a>, &amp; continued through the 30s as retail consumer spending and investing dropped, &amp; failing companies led to more &amp; more jobs lost.  A significant amount of working class people worldwide were forced into homelessness &amp; starvation due to lack of means to provide for themselves &amp; their families.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/6sqbzjlag4a71.png?width=1691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f835e4dee346adb6ae0d1a16556cfd0d649926d">Rough Dates: 29 Oct 1929 - 11 July 1932, S&amp;P perished 86.1&#37; from \~$31.8 to \~$4.4 (-$27.4)</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>So how far would the market have to fall to match the severity of each of these events?</h1>
