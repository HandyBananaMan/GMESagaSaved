<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This is going to be what i hope to be helpful data especially for u/criand to plug whatever holes he has left in his overall view on GME. I hope others can benefit from this data as well.</p>
<p>Criand was the one that posted about SLD periods first and because they are cycle based, i got myself intrigued and decided to look into them and to combine my T+21, T+35 with the SLD periods he mentioned to try and find "patturns" which i did.</p>
<p>These "patturns" explain most of the movement GME has had, ever and are in my opinion the Cycles that RC and DFV have been aware of since the start. I believe this is the case due to DFV's double down and exercise as well as RC's tweets corelating with the periods i'll be showing you below.</p>
<p>I don't understand why half the shit i'm about to show you happens. Here it is regardless.</p>
<p>Also this is a sort of part 1 or introduction into this. I'm working on combining option data with this theory to see what results i get and whether i can corelate option flow with these. That's gonna take me a while to do.</p>

<h1>Assface</h1>
<p>I've got nothing to say here. I just wanted to write assface instead of preface.</p>
<p>I seriously have no idea what preface means. Is it my face before it was a face? In that case, is there a post-face? A face after my face existed?</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>

<h1>What's an SLD</h1>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Money hedgies and MM's / Prime Brokers need to deposit to the NSCC(DTCC) before the monthly expiring options they sold expire. It's like insurance to the NSCC(DTCC) in case the member is over-exposed and the NSCC(DTCC) needs more cash to clear/net their shit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>To put it more simply, an SLD "period" consists of several parts that i'm going to break down here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every 3'rd Friday of the month, we have the start of the monthly <strong>"Options Expiry Period"</strong></li>
<li>Within the <strong>2 days before that</strong> an NSCC(DTCC) member needs to deliver their SLD to the NSCC.</li>
<li>During the next 3 days, the NSCC uses that cash for reasons. I <strong>assume</strong> position netting.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>16'th July</strong> is the <strong>3'rd Friday</strong> for the month of July.</li>
<li>Within <strong>14-16 July</strong> is when an NSCC member must deliver their SLD for this month's options.</li>
<li>Within <strong>16-20 July</strong> is when the DTCC uses the SLD for "stuff". <strong>Assuming</strong> netting.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>So</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>"Options Expiry Period"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>16'th to 20'th July</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>"SLD Delivery Period Start - End"</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>14'th to 16'th of July</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to sort of remember the Options Expiry Period &amp; SLD Deliver Start/End period naming for the sections that will follow.</p>

<h1>What's a T+21 / T+35 Cycle?</h1>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The period in which SHF's or MM's or whoever needs to deliver shares that have failed to be delivered as a possible result from excessive shorting/naked shorting or other stuff.</p>

<p>Sorry, not gonna explain T+ periods. You should know these by now.</p>
<p>Also, i agree that the T+ periods do not apply in GME's case due to that SHF's / MM's are using dirty tricks to have these periods NOT ever have any effect on GME. I still chose however to map, check and follow these periods for signs or indications of possible trading patterns or trading behaviors the SHF's or MM's might have.</p>
<p>Basically i'm not fully convinced that these periods have 0 effect on GME's price. While they are able to dodge these for the most part, i believe that in part, they're also not able to fully mitgate them either.</p>

<h1>The Effects of SLDs and T+ Periods / Cycles</h1>
<p>These technically apply for all stocks. We're going to of course focus on GME for this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>SLD Deposit Cycle/Period - Start</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/9593xtktskd71.png?width=1893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5cced73722f2977ad7c867066d71d1c7aca81757</p>
<p>On the chart above you have 2 lines. A linear one and then the GME price. The linear one indicates / touches points at which the start of the SLD Deposit Cycle starts.</p>
<p>On this date, the NSCC members are now able to deliver their monthly option SLD to the NSCC (DTCC). This doesn't mean they'll do that on this date.</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> (use your eyes) how within the 2 days they have to deliver the SLD, there's 1 last attempt to bring GME's price down. What's the reason? u/criand</p>
<p>It's strange. There's always obvious shorting within the 2-3 day SLD deposit period. Why, how?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>SLD Deposit Cycle/Period - End/Deadline</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/vvzn7sfvtkd71.png?width=1893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b172d2ae48d0c40bd7de39f2101afa9ee74bfc8</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> and compare the 2 pictures and see how between the start and end of the 2 day period the NSCC members have to deliver the goods (cash) to the NSCC for their monthly options how the price declined.</p>
<p>What's the game here?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Option Expiry Period (Last Day) - e.g When the SLD hits the market.</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/i3b4yc87ukd71.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57ae74766a5dfbce2f018cef30f4c56dd4c943c9</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notice</strong> the January and February SLD deliveries being bullish beyond fuck.</li>
<li><strong>Notice</strong> the February SLD Delivery causing a 180 Dollar drop</li>
<li><strong>Notice</strong> the 16'th of April SLD <strong><em>(DFV Exercise)</em></strong> delivery being a "<a href="https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1387822832558788614?s=20"><strong>NothingBurger</strong></a>".</li>
</ul>
<p>From these, we understand that the SLD delivery is a big / decent event. What would be interesting to try to understand is WHAT makes this bullish or bearish. Could it be previous or current or future Call / Put OI (Parity?)</p>
<p>SLD Option Expiry Periods (Last Day) can be very bullish or bearish. Would be interesting to find out what makes it so.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>T+21 &amp; T+35 Starting Dates</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/y13s6n04vkd71.png?width=1872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31b729a29bad753cabc487c4d13b38a02947eba2</p>
<p>These are all my own T+21 and T+35 periods. These come from no one else's data but my own.</p>
<p>I count the T+21 and T+35 counts together as i consider them to be part of the same cycle. Each T+35 has it's own T+21 and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> that the <strong>February</strong> and <strong>April T+21 and T+35</strong> cycles start almost exactly on top of the previous <strong>SLD Delivery Start periods</strong> e.g the 2 days the NSCC members have to deliver their monthly cash to the NSCC.</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> the last 2, <strong>June</strong> and <strong>July T+21 and T+35 starts</strong> and their position on the chart.</p>
<p>T+35 starts are generally bearish.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>T+35 Ending Date / Last Day of the T+35 Cycle</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/pe4mgsxyvkd71.png?width=1853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11ac01b10bdfb51526f0d87cbec47ef5404d578e</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> the January ramp up T+35 cycle's end. I wonder what happened here. Did a bunch of FTD's happen to hit the market? I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE</strong> the February T+35 position and the last time we ever saw FTD's appear on the SEC FTD list. This is where the hammer came down and fuckery started hard to prevent the MOASS. This is in my opinion where the MOASS was about to start but then measures were taken.</p>
<p>From there on, every other T+35 ending period ended up net flat. Look how nicely flat they are. No FTD's, no price movement.</p>
<p>T+35 Ends are generally bullish, when FTD's are allowed to surface.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>T+21 Ending Date / Last Day of T+21 Cycle (Sorry, i fudged the data)</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/1v3wqs77xkd71.png?width=1883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2292350c03df4e5f1c3db027f9f682ef6243056</p>
<p>Sorry i fudged the data for April 6 here. Couldn't be bothered to fix it. Bear with it.</p>
<p><strong>T+22</strong> was when the first February Marge took place. The fact that it happened on T+22 and not T+21 makes me think that this was a FINRA/SEC Auto-Lock, Buy In event. I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Generally T+21 seems to be bearish e.g short moar.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Forgot to mention the convergence of T+35, SLD &amp; Earnings in August. The date range i'm getting out of the SLD/T+ theories is August 11 - August 26.  The convergence of these events within a few days of each other is sort of rare and could be something to note. </p>
<p>I'm a date enjoyer, so i can't wait to see what happens.  </p>
<p><strong>SHF's and MM's are thieves and dickheads. Prove me wrong.</strong></p>
