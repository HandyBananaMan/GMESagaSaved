sup apes

not financial advice 

elliott wave guy here, was gonna do a super in depth post going over different sectors and wave counts to see if we can use the "peak" of other stocks in correlation to GME boom

got a lot of pretty colors for you, let's dive in! 

this fits the zen vibe, with a sprinkle of hype:  [https://open.spotify.com/track/5X3VpTYsESWoh80dMa60jd?si=a12838657b3a4b4a](https://open.spotify.com/track/5X3VpTYsESWoh80dMa60jd?si=a12838657b3a4b4a) 

That's the next DD, just wanted to share my thoughts briefly cause I'm FUCKING JACKED!

First off, chart is pretty much identical from a daily candle perspective to may right before we ran in june

&#x200B;

\*insert the office meme of pam saying its the same picture\*

but it gets better.

surface level analysis, no matter how tf you look at spy, it's signaling a short term top.

&#x200B;

![SPY](https://preview.redd.it/v61g9k48lnd71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=660bb0caea3e920408ff563cb62cebd8be405c2c)

not going in depth EW analysis today, technically this isn't labeled correct if this is how spy plays out from here, but idgaf. if its a wave 1 competing to the upside, wave 2 is a deep retrace anyway, vs a flat ABC correction.

![divergence anyone?](https://preview.redd.it/ibi53majlnd71.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cafa3f4d809cc140d9cd95fd07d9567bcdf51b7)

in my last post i talked about RSI divergence signals, low and behold, look what SPY is telling us.

hint: lower RSI on a higher high = expect a drop

&#x200B;

SPY futures are DOWN since trading started today

but wait.

there's MORE?!?!

crip toe was pumped THIS AM likely to meet monday liquidity requirements. For any new apes, bit koin (idk if auto mod will censor so jus taking precaution)and GME move inversely, whenever (crip toe) runs and dumps, we can assume GME will follow with a run.

&#x200B;

pump? check. dump? in progress. 

visualized correlation:

VIX barely up, but it's up. probably fill tiny gap to downside then who knows?

I also have an algo script on my TOS, take it with a grain of salt but it's decently accurate:

basically, uh, I'm jacked.

More in depth post when I have the time, I'm just mega jacked and I love sharing what I see with apes.

waving goodbye to cheapies ðŸŒŠ 

TLDR: GME is ready to run.
