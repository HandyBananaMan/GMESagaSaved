This has brought new house sales back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gi2wkzyaxld71.png?width=1460&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ef499f0187c2902c9942cf0ca990616202fe1a4\n\n[ Supply jumped to 6.3 months at the current rate of sales, as unsold speculative inventory for sale jumped to 353,000 houses \\(seasonally adjusted\\), the most since December 2008 ](https://preview.redd.it/xodlq1isxld71.png?width=1779&format=png&auto=webp&s=c833fcf097975dcb7bb9db325eb3a47e7993ffeb)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oaimxynvxld71.png?width=2932&format=png&auto=webp&s=6625571491515a82abc7f1d8664c43e925799da8\n\n[The median price dropped by 5.0&#37; in June from May's $380,700 to $361,000, \\(lowest since March\\).

The under $300,000 price category accounted for only 29% of total new house sales (down from 39% June of last year).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1c0b2sf0md71.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=315d613fe988975fe53c47b5d7ba95306718fbab\n\nThat\u2019s where all the buying had been occurring when everything was going gangbusters, but anyone looking for a new house under $300,000 is now priced out.\n\nOn the high end though, people with money are loving the Fed going brrr!\n\n[Houses with a price of over $500,000 accounted for 28&#37; of total sales in June, up from a share of 23&#37; in May, 15&#37; in June 2020, and 14&#37; in June 2019. ](https://i.redd.it/q040usp50md71.gif)\n\nAt the high end, big money is spending on new houses. If you can't spend more than 300k on a house?  Enjoying renting for more than what a mortgage is.\n\n[ u\\/Alldayshorts420 ](https://preview.redd.it/6pn6saa81md71.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dea7e97e0ec63448c05ef2fec09b223b0e518ed)\n\n# This is what this new Fed-directed money-printing economy has turned into, inflated asset prices that has priced people out of homeownership!\n\nI just wonder how long the high-end demand can prop up the housing market? Especially since it was the 'little guy' carrying the burden last year--numbers show they are now priced out.\n\n# Prices are all still jumping though!\n\nThe [Construction Cost Index](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html) by the Commerce Department was also released today. It tracks construction-related costs of single-family houses under construction but excludes the cost of land and other non-construction costs.\n\nIn June the index rose by 0.7% from May. Over the past six months annualized, the index spiked by 13.8%. Year-over-year, the index spiked by 11.1%, the biggest year-over-year jump since May 1980!\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.census.gov\\/construction\\/nrs\\/pdf\\/price\\_uc.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/6657nbn22md71.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ca8407ec1a44100cc187baab7035975ed702fae)\n\n# All of this happening in the backdrop of the Fed still plowing away with [$120 billion in assets purchases each month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-bank-will-begin-reducing-bond-purchases-well-before-raising-interest-rates-powell-says-11618421656):\n\n$40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. This will continue to depress mortgage rates and **only continues to add gasoline to the inflation fire**.\n\n$80 billion in Treasury securities a month (with policy rates near 0%): represses short-term and long-term interest rates in general, and inflates asset prices and consumer prices, which **further DESTROYS the purchasing power of the dollar**.\n\nTL:DR The Dollar losing purchasing power + Inflation = Permanent Loss of purchasing power.\n\nUnless one of the many other catalysts triggers the MOASS, [I believe inflation is the match that has been lit that will light the fuse of the rocket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oe6i3l/tldr_i_believe_inflation_is_the_match_that_has/).\n\n**Buckle Up.**\n\n[ Thanks for dropping by and taking a dive, have a GREAT rest of your Monday!
