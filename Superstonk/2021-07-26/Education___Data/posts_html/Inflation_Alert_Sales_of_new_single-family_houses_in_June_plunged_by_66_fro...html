<p>Sales of new single-family houses in June fell by 6.6% from May, and by 32% from the peak in January, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 houses, the lowest June since 2018, according to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html">Census Bureau</a> today. This has brought new house sales back to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<h1>So what is happening?</h1>
<p>Almost nothing was sold in the under $200,000 price category (2% of sales in June). The under $300,000 price category accounted for only 29% of total new house sales (down from 39% June of last year).</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s where all the buying had been occurring when everything was going gangbusters, but anyone looking for a new house under $300,000 is now priced out.</p>
<p>On the high end though, people with money are loving the Fed going brrr!</p>
<p><img alt="Houses with a price of over $500,000 accounted for 28&#37; of total sales in June, up from a share of 23&#37; in May, 15&#37; in June 2020, and 14&#37; in June 2019. " src="https://i.redd.it/q040usp50md71.gif" /></p>
<p>At the high end, big money is spending on new houses. If you can't spend more than 300k on a house?  Enjoying renting for more than what a mortgage is.</p>

<h1>This is what this new Fed-directed money-printing economy has turned into, inflated asset prices that has priced people out of homeownership!</h1>
<p>I just wonder how long the high-end demand can prop up the housing market? Especially since it was the 'little guy' carrying the burden last year--numbers show they are now priced out.</p>
<h1>Prices are all still jumping though!</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/index.html">Construction Cost Index</a> by the Commerce Department was also released today. It tracks construction-related costs of single-family houses under construction but excludes the cost of land and other non-construction costs.</p>
<p>In June the index rose by 0.7% from May. Over the past six months annualized, the index spiked by 13.8%. Year-over-year, the index spiked by 11.1%, the biggest year-over-year jump since May 1980!</p>

<h1>All of this happening in the backdrop of the Fed still plowing away with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-bank-will-begin-reducing-bond-purchases-well-before-raising-interest-rates-powell-says-11618421656">$120 billion in assets purchases each month</a>:</h1>
<p>$40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. This will continue to depress mortgage rates and <strong>only continues to add gasoline to the inflation fire</strong>.</p>
<p>$80 billion in Treasury securities a month (with policy rates near 0%): represses short-term and long-term interest rates in general, and inflates asset prices and consumer prices, which <strong>further DESTROYS the purchasing power of the dollar</strong>.</p>
<p>TL:DR The Dollar losing purchasing power + Inflation = Permanent Loss of purchasing power.</p>
