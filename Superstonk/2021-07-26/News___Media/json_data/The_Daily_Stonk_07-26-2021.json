(I'd say yes as there are some 3k who regularly upvote (and leave a lot of encouragement) and knowing only about 1/10th upvote on the bigger subreddits IIRC that means there should be some 10-30k or more reading it)\n\nIf so who and how will it continue?\n\nShould it be mods who does it, normal users or both? (I'd say both)\n\nShould it be a one-man job or a group effort? (I and others would recommend a group effort as it can take a lot of time and effort to make the daily stonk, I'd say about 2-3 hours for a slow/normal day and something like 7-8 hours for a big day like last Friday, at least for a lurker like me)\n\nAnd if a group effort how would the work be spilt up, should it be collaborative per post or 1 person cover 1 day?\n\nI also believe The daily stonk should be posted on the same account to avoid confusion and avoid people having to follow multiple accounts and ideally posted by a mod.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want you guys and the mods to think about this over the week and If it will continue, to organize it before the weekend as I will not take part in it and go back to mostly lurking.\n\nAnd Thank You for your patience and understanding for the past and next week as it's been quite experimental and a spur-of-the-moment. Edit I will also not change the format as I do not feel the need nor time to do so as I will only do a few more Daily stonk that said if there will be someone taking over after me they are welcomed to change it as they feel is fitting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [\ud83d\udd34Daily Reverse Repo Update 07/23: $877.251B\ud83d\udd34](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oq6yu9/daily_reverse_repo_update_0723_877251b/)- [u/pctracer](https://www.reddit.com/user/pctracer/)\n\n[credit to u\\/pctracer](https://preview.redd.it/iahcvr53rid71.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d43a59ac6fa2102dc61ec316df754184bff4704)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Mod updates and overview\n\n[Onwards and Upwards](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/or4ej1/onwards_and_upwards/) \\- [u/jsmar18](https://www.reddit.com/user/jsmar18/)\n\nQuite a few things, First the mod list will be rearranged so expect the mods to be removed and re-added to the list, The mods are looking into adding more mods as they are understaffed, The Automod ban on the term Infinity Pool has been revoked, They are working on trying to get crossposting back, at least on a limited bases, The awards contest have not been forgotten and it's still on they just need some time to sort it out, They are developing internal policies to avoid more mod drama And they want to \"reiterate that attempting to circumvent Automod is a major violation of the rules.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [The MOAFF | The Mother of All F\\*cking Filings | NSCC-2021-803 / 010 | 369 Pages Long, Master Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/or2r9y/the_moaff_the_mother_of_all_fcking_filings/) - [u/Horror\\_Veterinar](https://www.reddit.com/user/Horror_Veterinar/)\n\nHorror\\_Veterinar have and will take a big look at the newest NSCC filings and keep updating this post as he goes through it and he has split it up into different sections, first for how many edits, third for explanations for new definitions and the main post under that, I will also keep this post at the bottom for now for ease of finding when new edits are introduced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Infinite Money Glitch Explained - My thoughts on how Criand's latest comments blow the scam wide open](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opzvst/infinite_money_glitch_explained_my_thoughts_on/) - [u/polypolipauli](https://www.reddit.com/user/polypolipauli/)\n\npolypolipauli goes on to explain how the FTD can-kicking works, based on [Criand's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opuziu/visual_of_the_sft_trades_to_prevent_shorts_andor/) in simplified emoji form.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [NSCC-2021-010 Part 2, Are They Getting Rid of FTDs for Good?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/or8dry/nscc2021010_part_2_are_they_getting_rid_of_ftds/) - [u/npham54](https://www.reddit.com/user/npham54/)\n\nnpham54 interprets part of the NSCC-2021-010 that in the new proposed system members might not \"have the ability to create FTDs anymore\", be sure to be careful to take interpretations as gospel until we know more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [My thoughts & insights on the latest SR-NSCC-21-803 filing; lots of liquidation & default talk!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oq3pyt/my_thoughts_insights_on_the_latest_srnscc21803/) - [u/xRehab](https://www.reddit.com/user/xRehab/)\n\nxRehab adds some of his thoughts to parts of the SR-NSCC-21-803 filing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [\"So what are naked shorts?\" An infographic overview of naked shorts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oro4mc/so_what_are_naked_shorts_an_infographic_overview/) - [u/catsinbranches](https://www.reddit.com/user/catsinbranches/)\n\n[credit to u\\/catsinbranches](https://preview.redd.it/dz5r5qkarid71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0f054e5b2c79cf41a4eaf57d17d25bee37745dc)\n\n# [\\[Speculative\\] Piecing together the ITM CALLs and the OTM PUTs.
