<p>This fact had me dying laughing in the shower this morning. Like how much sweeter can this get? They were that fucking cocky back in February they straight up lied to congress about covering their shorts, called us antisemitic or some shit, and have the audacity to keep pumping out shill articles claiming we're the ones manipulating the market. Guys I think hedge fund managers might be the most entitled pricks in the world lmao. They're literally just like that one whiney ass kid in COD lobby who gets a 0.2 KD every match and accuses you of using an aim bot.</p>
