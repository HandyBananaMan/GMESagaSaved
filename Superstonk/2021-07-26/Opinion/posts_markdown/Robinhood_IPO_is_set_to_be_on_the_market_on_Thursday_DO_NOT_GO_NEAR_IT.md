Robinhood, Citadel and all the other fuckers with short positions in GME are acutely aware of how much hatred retail traders have for Robinhood because of the buying restrictions placed on GME in January. 

They are very well aware that many retail traders will be tempted to short Robinhood as a show of defiance. 

Let me ask you something, if the hedgies see all the people who hold the very stock that is threatening their bankruptcy suddenly open short positions in Robinhood, what would be the most logical thing for them to do? If you said "pour a lot of money into long positions on Robinhood to short squeeze retail traders" you would be correct. 

DO NOT TOUCH THE ROBINHOOD IPO!! DO NOT GO LONG ON IT, DO NOT GO SHORT ON IT, IGNORE IT. 

The last thing any retail trader wants is to be margin called and forced to sell their GME shares to cover by the very people who deserve that exact scenario.
