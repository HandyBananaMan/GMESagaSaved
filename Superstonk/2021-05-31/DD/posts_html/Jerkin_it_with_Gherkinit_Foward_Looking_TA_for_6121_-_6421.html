<p>Hello Superstonk!</p>
<p>I hope all of you have had an awesome Memorial Weekend! But like all insufferable waits, it's almost over as we gear up for market open tomorrow.</p>
<p>I did a massive Exit DD compilation to try to ease the agony of not having markets today, if you haven't gotten a chance <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nogxnr/infinity_war_the_final_exit_dd_compilation/">check it out</a>.</p>
<p>As always later tonight I will post a consolidated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial">Video DD of this on my YouTube</a> for those of you that don't have the time to read through this, or have reading comprehension issues it will be posted by 9pm EDT.</p>
<p>Crayons sharpened ?</p>
<p>Ok, let's do this...</p>
<h1>Technical Analysis for this Week</h1>
<p><strong>The Ascending Channel</strong></p>
<p>This week I expect a continuation of the uptrend that began on May 11^(th). As we can see our uptrend is beginning to form a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broadeningformation.asp">broadening formation</a> as volume and volatility began top pick up. Normally this is a bearish signal, but in the case of GME the interesting thing is that due to sell pressure being low, and short inflation being high this broadening formation is also defined by an ascending channel. This implies that buyers are willing to buy higher, shorting is not profitable, and potential sellers are not taking profits (GME undervalued, hedgies are fuk, and apes hodl)</p>

<p>Another thing to note here is that we can see there was very little short pressure this week before we broke to the upside of the bull flag that began forming last Tuesday. And even though we experienced increased downward pressure on Friday we are still well within the lower resistance of that flag.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/dqsht4lh0j271.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d905f55bca1138ce86e0debaed43af7907b7cac">Visualization of short pressure over the last few weeks 4h timescale</a></p>
<p>Due to this I think tomorrow we may see additional movement down to a bounce off that lower resistance around $212.50 to 217.50 before continuing upward.</p>
<p>One last thing I wanted to point out on this chart, was this deviation from the expected pattern. Every week since the May 11th we have formed a bull flag in the early week and then corrected downwards and then ended the week slightly above max pain. This is the pattern I hypothesized in my DDs for weeks. It has so far proved true. Until this last Wednesday (although we still ended way above max pain @$200)</p>

<p>I have a few theories as to what occurred here.</p>
<ol>
<li>FOMO kicked in - This is probably the most likely as AMC was running and the media started expressing squeeze potential in "meme" stocks, people simply didn't want to miss the gravy train.</li>
<li>We had a correction - This is also really likely, as we ran up really hard this week it is possible Friday's action represented a small correction while we consolidate for another push upwards</li>
<li>A small margin call occurred - Remember the first short out of this is the lucky one? Well due to our constant uptrend it is a possibility that a smaller firm was called and covered. This could mean the dominos have begun to fall.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is speculative as we have no way of knowing for sure, but ties into some rumors floating around that smaller positions had been called in the previous week. I will be paying close attention for any other deviations like this one in the coming weeks signaling that the logic backing this thesis could be sound. If not, we should just continue to see a continuation of the aforementioned uptrend.</p>
<h1>Indicators for this Week</h1>
<p><strong>I. MACD</strong></p>
<p>MACD is continuing it's divergence I expect it will continue to diverge throughout this week as price action increases</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/yod6kr9z3j271.png?width=1418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef6dd55300b57f9ad39dc1ccd3cadb45e9900ca1">MACD on the 1D timescale</a></p>
<p><strong>II. BBKC / TTM Squeeze</strong></p>
<p>We are now sitting on four green signals and the expansion of the Bollinger Bands outside of the Keltner Channel is beginning. I think we will see increasing volume and volatility as our 31 trading day consolidation begins to unwind. I cannot express in words how primed this looks to just blow up. So I guess I'll just have to show you.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/gwvrzb6e6j271.png?width=2445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa68f07207359afc3506b874e675991bc22414c8">BBKC\/TTM on the 1D timescale...WTF?</a></p>
<p><strong>III. CV-VWAP</strong></p>
<p>This indicator showed a signal on May 21^(st) when German markets were closed for Pentecost. So there was arbitrage. I will be checking tomorrow morning for this to fire again as US markets were closed today. Stay tuned to find out in the daily live charting.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Everything looks good this week as we begin the first stages of lift off. I do not expect a dip below 212.50, but I am looking for a Tuesday dip in the early hours after market open. This could change based on arbitrage from the EU markets I will let people know in the morning update. Thank you all, I truly love being able to disseminate this information and get it out to all of you apes that follow along. By the end of this I hope we collectively represent the most financially literate generation of the last few centuries.</p>
