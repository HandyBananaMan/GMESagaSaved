I’ve been driving for a big chunk of the day and hopped on /r/Superstock and the first thing that caught my eye was a bunch of comments and posts about Apes crashing the market or bringing down the economy. It honestly feels like FUD. Buying and holding a stock never has and never fucking will do such a thing. You know what can and has before? Naked short selling. Buy. HODL. Vote. 🚀🌝🦍💎
