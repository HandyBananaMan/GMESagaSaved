The only reason people are making these stories up are because you guys are suckers and will upvote and shower any half-baked post with awards. These posts are just as bad as FUD because they generate unnecessary hype and speculation which is the last thing we need at this stage in the game. We really need more skepticism and critical thinking in this sub. It\u2019s only gonna get worse from here so we need to be resilient and stop soaking up everything that\u2019s fed to us.",
