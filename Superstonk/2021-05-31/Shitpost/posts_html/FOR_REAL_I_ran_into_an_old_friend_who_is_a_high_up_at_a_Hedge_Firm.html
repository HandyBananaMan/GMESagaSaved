<p>I asked him about GME, the stocks, and his thoughts on current market volatility. He was very upset and confused. Repeatedly saying "I'm a landscaper, I don't understand what your saying", fucking shill. He's worked at Evergreen Lawn, Garden, and Hedges for 8 years, he knows the ins and out, he knows their tricks.</p>
<p>The fact he wont even acknowledge what the stock market is lets me know how deep this truly goes.</p>
<p>SEE YOU APES ON TUESDAY!</p>
