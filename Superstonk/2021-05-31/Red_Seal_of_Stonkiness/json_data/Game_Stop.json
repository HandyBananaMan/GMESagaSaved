This effectively puts them in the same moderator power level as u/rensole and u/redchessqueen99. While Reddit's hierarchy still remains the same, these two will now have access to Community Settings and Full Permissions, giving them the ability to adjust site settings, give moderator awards, add and remove mods, and much more, but overall will be seen as top authorities in the moderator team.\n\n* [u/Bye\\_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)\n   * BT been with us since [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) days (he wrote the r/GME FAQ) and has been a critical mod at r/Superstonk. His steadfast work ethic, dedication to the community, strong skills and relationships with the other mods, and his ethical stature are all key aspects of why we feel this promotion is warranted. He has also been very active in our mod chat, and has helped to keep the peace and mediate disagreements for the betterment of all mods and the community at large.\n* [u/Pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pinkcatsonacid/)\n   * Pink has been dedicated to this subreddit since her addition as mod. She has become a beloved friend to many of us, and I think she brings invaluable insight and purpose to the mod team as well as the community. She has demonstrated her worth time and time again with tireless work ethic, dedication to the ape community, and close relationships that no doubt will strengthen them both as it emanates outward to the rest of us.\n\n[Apes Together Strong](https://preview.redd.it/uc3wcx5tok271.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bed62b2f34bf0426b372e99eafbcf9c8f5c4e4af)\n\nI think this could also mark an evolutionary transition for [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) in terms of moderator structuring and the scope of the sub itself. When [u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/) and I were at [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), all mods had Full Permissions. This actually caused a lot of issues since some mods abused those permissions, and it effectively led to the migration from the sub. As a result, we have been very careful with who we give permissions to in an attempt to prevent catastrophe. It's worked so far, but we feel it is time to expand permissions to those deserving.\n\nu/Bye_Triangle and u/Pinkcatsonacid have tirelessly worked for the growth and integrity of r/Superstonk, and I have come to trust them and love them as fellow apes and friends in this journey. I have no qualms promoting them both to Full Permissions admin-level roles. We hope they can assist us heavily in acting as authorities for the sub and in leading the mod team and ape community as a whole into the future. This is very much deserved, so please make sure to give them serious congratulations. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e CONGRATULATIONS \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n# MOASS Defense\n\nOver the past few months, as far back as my tenure at r/GME, there have been questions about the MOASS and how we would protect the sub in the event of a cataclysmic series of events. Ever since, we have been working with a special team of wrinkle-brained apes, and the mods, to develop a solution to this inevitable outcome.\n\nI am proud to announce that this solution is finally ready for implementation, and today it received a majority-vote from the r/Superstonk mod team, and is therefore approved and now being implemented.\n\nThis plan will address the following concerns:\n\n1. How will we defend against the onslaught of new members from the MOASS?\n2. How are we going to protect against incoming FUD attacks?\n3. How do we discourage a sub split effort?\n4. How do we allow those hurt by age/karma limits to remain included?\n5. What has Red been alluding to for the past two months?\n\nTo answer these concerns, we have worked diligently to come up with a multi-faceted plan that will no doubt secure the subreddit for the foreseen future. But first, I should introduce you to a little secret we mods have been keeping from you all... don't worry, we kept it secret for one particular and very important purpose: to study unsuspecting shills.\n\n[My cat on my laptop: \\\\\"I'm in.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/7iomr9b6pk271.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=96e57d4a390575613e487e76ff99d68e41c03d36)\n\nP**lease read this message:**\n\nGreetings to all Ape-Kind! I\u2019m u/grungromp.\n\nStrap in. We\u2019ve got a lot of text to get through.\n\nBack in March, some Apes who have some brain wrinkles about behavior got together with some Apes who know how to use computers real good to try and develop a method of countering the invasion of nefarious actors trying to spread FUD to our community. We contacted the mods on r/gme to see if the project would be of worth and u/redchessqueen99 responded with emphatic support. Upon the Great Ape Migration to r/Superstonk, she invited us to continue our work with her direct involvement here.\n\nWith the behind the scenes view we were given of the sub, we\u2019ve been working over the past three months to put together a system of shill detection. We wanted this to be the proverbial headshot, and needed to make sure we limited collateral damage to Apes, while also not giving shills time to adapt. We sincerely wish we\u2019d been able to be faster about it, but we were literally generating this project from the ground up, as (to our awareness) no one has ever attempted something like this before, or even had the need to.\n\nBefore we describe the project, we\u2019d like to offer you a bit of insight into what we\u2019ve been seeing with the sub over the past week to establish the need, if it hasn\u2019t already been obvious to the average Ape.\n\nThe age and karma restrictions were originally put into place on r/superstonk on April 25. This prohibited comments from accounts under 30 days old, and posts from accounts under 60. We realized this meant that on May 25th, accounts that had been created on and around the day the restrictions were put in place would be able to start a massive FUD campaign.\n\nWe were right.\n\nIn the last week, the amount of accounts posting in the sub whom we have been able to identify as shills has increased at least 8 times. Where we were seeing 3 in 100 suspicious looking posts and accounts at times previously, over the past week that number has jumped to 24 in 100.\n\nWith that in mind, we have decided that now is the moment to make our stand.\n\nWe\u2019d like to introduce you all to **Satori**.\n\n[Shorting shills since 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/072qgrnnck271.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=791923e8726db74fc069a80ad400717cc306b1b0)\n\nOne of the greatest advantages the hedge funds have had over us during this entire process is the ability to manipulate the market by using technology that we don\u2019t have access to. High frequency trading and algorithms have put a pretty massive finger on the scales to tip the markets in their favor. That is why we feel that Satori is so important and could be such a boon to the Ape community. This evens the playing field, giving us the advantage of advanced technological analysis on our home court. In essence, this allows us to \u201cShort the Shills.\u201d They have no idea that this is coming. And they are not prepared.\n\nA few points of import about Satori and it\u2019s capabilities\n\n* As with our analysis of GME as a stock, Satori functions almost entirely with publicly available information. Every possible publicly seen feature of Reddit is included to some degree. While we do utilize some privileged information from the Moderation team, that is the extent of our data gathering. We do not have access to private chats, ip addresses, or anything that is not available to public view.\n* Satori is designed to analyze every single poster in r/Superstonk and generate a confidence interval of how likely they are to be a shill. The higher the score, the more likely the account is a shill. That information will be given to the Mods in order to inform their plans and decision making. It will not be public information. However, it is important to note that the system is designed to identify bad actors based on their actions. Just because an account hasn't posted anything shilly YET doesn't mean they never will. Therefore, a low \u201cShill Score\u2122\u201d is not considered a guarantee of Ape-ness. Do not assume that anyone posting has been granted an \u201call clear.\u201d\n* As is the case with all human activity, shilling isn\u2019t a black and white issue. There is a chance of error on both ends, both shills that will go undetected as well as real Apes who are flagged as suspicious. It\u2019s a truth that we\u2019re aware of, and we\u2019ve taken as much time as we could to be as accurate as possible. We have worked with the mod team and recommended several steps for mitigating this after implementation.\n\n[ Satori \\(\u899a, \\\\\"consciousness\\\\\"\\) in Japanese folklore are mind-reading monkey-like monsters \\(\\\\\"y\u014dkai\\\\\"\\) said to dwell within the mountains of Hida and Mino. ](https://preview.redd.it/cyfxillrgk271.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1983c2fbefe8b7fb1d54224ea47687d86869ba8)\n\n* Satori is NOT designed to detect and identify negative sentiment toward GME. It is NOT designed to shut down criticism of the stock or DD. It is NOT simply a method to amplify any echo chamber effect. Continue to doubt, research, and criticize, as has been the mantra of our community since its inception. Our only aim is to contribute to making r/Superstonk a platform where Apes can freely discuss GME and share memes by counteracting bad actors who want to disrupt our community for nefarious purposes.\n* We are aware that transparency and sharing of information is an essential part of the Ape community. However, we are not going to be revealing the specifics of our tech, nor the metrics which it uses to analyze the content of the sub. This information may come out eventually, likely post MOASS, but if we were to give specifics in order to make an appeal to the idea of transparency, we would be handing a manual to the shills on exactly how to behave to hide from our mind reading monkey machine. Please understand that Satori has been tested and vetted in hundreds of iterations to arrive at this point, and that the Mods have seen and approved of our methods and will keep oversight over every change and decision.\n* We will leave it to u/redchessqueen99 and the mod group to describe the implementation process and how the technology will be utilized. But know that our team\u2019s tits are jacked to levels unheard of before at the fact that we finally get to deploy our virtual psychic primate.\n\n[ \\\\\"I see... I see... I see a lot of shadow marketing companies freaking out.\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/31z3goqzgk271.jpg?width=343&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b77ee83ae72fca8accdb3bd9ca0c96b4ccf1829)\n\nWhile we have yet to use Satori for sweeping changes on the sub, the mod team has already utilized it at various points. In smaller instances, Satori has already been used to see and identify FUD campaigns, target suspicious users, and plan specific moves and posts within the community. While those instances have been helpful, we recognize the potential for what Satori is capable of is so much greater, and now is our time to utilize it to it\u2019s capacity.\n\nWith all that new information presented to you, we do have one small request. This is brand new. There will be some bumps along the way. We\u2019ve done our best to see and plan for every possible outcome, but we are aware that we will have missed some things. It will be a bit messy as we get things up and running. You have our promise that we will continue to refine our processes and do whatever is needed to ensure this community has the protection it deserves in the face of what we\u2019re dealing with.\n\nWe don\u2019t mean to wax hyperbolic, but this may be one of the most powerful pieces of technology developed in history that deals specifically with community analysis and management. It\u2019s been grassroots created by Apes, for Apes, and, to our knowledge, no one else has ever developed anything like this. Apes are now in possession of an asset that gives us autonomy and power that few other online communities have ever come close to harnessing. We\u2019ve taken punch after punch from the hedgies; shills, infiltrators, propaganda, media manipulation, and market manipulation. Our team could not be more proud of the way this incredible community has taken every blow and got back to our hairy, prehensile feet.\n\nBut now? We have a way to counter punch. Hard.  And we will do it with a nuke dropped off our rocket as we leave Earth\u2019s atmosphere on our way to the stars.\n\nIn the words of Ryan Cohen: R.I.P. Dumb Asses\n\nApes Strong Together\n\nBuy. Hodl. Vote. Fight.\n\n\\---\n\n**Note from** u/redchessqueen99\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\nSatori was created and developed by a team that was largely kept private for over two months now. This team includes [u/catto\\_del\\_fatto](https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/),  [u/grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/grungromp/), and [u/Captain-Fan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Captain-Fan/). I have personally worked with them since before the r/Superstonk migration from r/GME, and can say they have become some of my most trusted friends.\n\nu/catto_del_fatto was also added awhile back as a mod to incorporate moderator-level data into the information-gathering aspects of Satori, thus allowing the mod team to talk to him directly and help provide shill data for the system. Catto has officially accepted a full-time mod role with general moderator permissions, and we are looking forward to continuing this project and fostering a deeper relationship between the Satori team and the moderator team.\n\nTL;DR: r/Superstonk has an intelligence division.\n\n[Asta la vista, baby.](https://preview.redd.it/nechp7j0dk271.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd6ba796a7eef2dc785b89595ae5bdf855969ffd)\n\n# The Plan\n\n* **Increase karma and age filters**\n   * Posts : 60 days / 500 karma ---> 120 days / 2000 karma\n      * Accounts will need have been created earlier than February 1, 2021\n   * Comments: 30 days / 250 karma ---> 60 days / 500 karma\n      * Accounts will need to have been created earlier than April 1, 2021\n      * Note: Superstonk Migration was April 4, 2021\n   * These limits will need to scale as time progresses; until the MOASS; while we hone and implement this program for total effectiveness.\n   * These limits will be implemented on June 1, 2021 sometime throughout the day.\n* **Activate** ***Satori***\n   * The immediate goal of Satori is to make sure that true apes are not locked out due to the increased restrictions. However, bans are an automated capability.\n   * \"Mod-bots\" will be added to the mod team and given approve and ban permissions, and then programmed to automate the approval or ban process via a generated list of users.\n   * u/Satori-Blue-Shell is currently the only mod-bot added and is actively Approving members\n   * APPROVALS - All users who were created after the Blip (end of January) and are not on the high risk list of users, with be added to the Approved Users in waves. By being added as Approved Users, they will bypass the karma and age filters. This will actively allow MORE true apes to participate in the sub.\n   * BANS - Mods will receive spreadsheets of high risk users, where they can approve or deny users, and then these lists will be implemented for automated implementation.\n* **Mods will officially now be allowed to Approve users they trust in addition to Satori**\n   * Previously, we did not allow approving users because we suspected some foul play associated with that. Now, however, due to the sheer volume of approvals, we feel confident that we can add this to our arsenal of methods to protect apes in r/Superstonk.\n* **Minimize Fallout**\n   * This plan prioritizes the positive aspects of Satori over the negative, and allows mod oversight on the bans process. Halting Satori is as simple as removing permissions from the mod-bot.\n   * Many of you who couldn't post due to age and karma limits, will now  will be able to, once added to the Approved Users list. If you are not added, please be patient, as we are currently approving in waves.\n   * This will incentivize good behavior, because apes will not want to lose their approved status, or will want to earn it in the first place. Overall, we are essentially making it harder to post and comment on Superstonk, and then rewarding loyal apes with approvals that allow them to post or comment without any restrictions.\n   * Therefore, I am convinced this will make r/Superstonk a better experience for true apes, while making it a nightmare for the imposters and shills.\n\n*Please note that Satori does not have access to private chats, discords, or other private aspects of your account and it is currently limited to Reddit. We only scan publicly available content as well as what can be seen from a moderator perspective, which primarily includes removed posts and comments. We respect your privacy, and are merely utilizing the same levels of intel used against us to even the playing field.*\n\n[Shillpocalypse \\(by u\\/grungromp\\)](https://preview.redd.it/broy2hwpck271.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e50c469e37c5bb980c02927d5ed0bb10f0b761)\n\nWith two new admin-level mods to help keep oversight, and with such an incredible software creation by the Satori team, we are poised to not only defend against the constant FUD, shills, and MOASS popularity, but also to remain a secure and reliable source of knowledge sharing - forever.\n\nI don't want to say we will never end up like r/wallstreetbets ... but we'll never end up like r/wallstreetbets. Satori is the first of many projects that utilize modern technology to advance our capabilities as a subreddit. I am excited for some of the other projects already in the pipeline.
