[DEBUNKED - SEE FIRST COMMENT]

I saw a great video of Overstock CEO explaining what Phantom Shares is. It's from 2012 so kinda old: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5\_8z53A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5_8z53A)

AT THE VERY END, at round 8:00, he says: ***"The SEC said: we have to grandfather, forgive, all the phantom shares that are in the system because we are afraid of the volatility..\[...\].. because it can crack the system"***

What excactly did he mean by that, and what did the SEC do with the naked shorting of Overstock stock?
