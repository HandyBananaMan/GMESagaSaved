It's from 2012 so kinda old: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5\\_8z53A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5_8z53A)\n\nAT THE VERY END, at round 8:00, he says: ***\"The SEC said: we have to grandfather, forgive, all the phantom shares that are in the system because we are afraid of the volatility..\\[...\\].. because it can crack the system\"***\n\nWhat excactly did he mean by that, and what did the SEC do with the naked shorting of Overstock stock?",
