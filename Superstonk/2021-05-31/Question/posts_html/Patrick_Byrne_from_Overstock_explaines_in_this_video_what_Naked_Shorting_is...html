<p>[DEBUNKED - SEE FIRST COMMENT]</p>
<p>I saw a great video of Overstock CEO explaining what Phantom Shares is. It's from 2012 so kinda old: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5_8z53A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5_8z53A</a></p>
<p>AT THE VERY END, at round 8:00, he says: <strong><em>"The SEC said: we have to grandfather, forgive, all the phantom shares that are in the system because we are afraid of the volatility..[...].. because it can crack the system"</em></strong></p>
<p>What excactly did he mean by that, and what did the SEC do with the naked shorting of Overstock stock?</p>
