    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI've submitted a few FOIAs to multiple organizations to try and get to the bottom of the missing SR-DTC-2021-005\n\n* Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\n* SEC\n\nI've filed an FBI tip regarding the disappearance of this regulation filing and have also submitted a FINRA tip on their tipline.\n\nI am unfortunately a Euro-Ape and have no other avenues to pursue this. If you're an American ape, i wish you'd do a few google searches about FOIA requests and the relevant tip-lines to try and put some pressure on this and perhaps get it resolved.\n\nDo not spam these services. Simply contact them if you have concerns regarding SR-DTC-2021-005 and ask why it disappeared, who made it disappear and when we'll see it re-filed again. Hopefully this make a few people ask the right questions.\n\nI'm not gonna make it easy for you to contact these authorities by giving you a link here. Just google it. If you can't be bothered to google it, then you can't be bothered to spend 1hr of your life enquiring about SR-DTC-2021-005 to the relevant authorities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: This is the template i used.
