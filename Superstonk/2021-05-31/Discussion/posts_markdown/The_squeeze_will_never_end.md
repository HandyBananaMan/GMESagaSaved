Holy fucking shit guys.

Just holy fucking shit.

If the etoro numbers are correct, and there's 1.3b shares among 90 million shareholders.

And the hedgies need to buy back to a GENEROUS 40m

All it will take is....

Half of all holders keeping 1 share in the infinity pool.

And the squeeze will never end.

What the ever loving fuck.

10m is not a joke. It's not even close.

In short etoro customer service confirmed etoro has 1.5% of all GME shareholders.

Etoro announced they have just over 20m investors, and 6.71% of their investors own GME.

20m\*6.71% = 1.34m GME investors on Etoro

1.34 / 1.5% = 89M GME investors total

Nordnet data suggests an average of 14.5 shares per investor on their platform.

For a total estimate of 1.29 billion shares
