    "selftext": "Either FUD or plain retarded. \n    (Edit2: seems more like op got over excited and was not trying to spread FUD. Still false info on his/her part tho)\n\nliterally this whole theory hinges on some random customer service rep from Etoro. We're smarter than this nonsense, you'd have to genuinely be retarded to believe this. \n\nThey'd love for us to think the short is sooo bad that fighting our ass off to vote isn't worth it or figuring it out isn't worth it. \n\nbut if you want hard numbers, does it seem reasonable to you that like 3% of the entire world's 20+ population owns GME? Keep in mind the majority of these people are in Africa/India/SA and other developing or undeveloped countries\n\ndoes it seem believable that the average Etoro user owns less than 1 share? \n\ncmon guys. use fucking common sense. this sub brought to the world HOC1-3 and other masterpiece DDs. Crackpot retardation like this should not be upvoted, especially when the key info is a fucking customer service rep who's probably working from India and doesn't know wtf is going on\n\nEdit: lol etoro literally says 96k https://i.imgur.com/yNPsSb6.jpg\n\nThe other post about this topic also confirms 96k holders (https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/npcczs/etoro_misinformation_etoro_does_not_have_13m/)",
