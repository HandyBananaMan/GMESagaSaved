    "selftext": "TLDR: Etoro has about 1.2 million TOTAL funded shareholder accounts.  His calculation is based off of 1.2 million Etoro shareholders that own GME.  \n\n# New Estimate:\n\nThis is the post I'm referencing: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np4wwu/etoro\\_got\\_their\\_15\\_of\\_all\\_gme\\_holder\\_straight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np4wwu/etoro_got_their_15_of_all_gme_holder_straight/)\n\nEtoro has 1.2 million funded accounts (page 5) [https://marketing.etorostatic.com/cache1/pdf/eToro-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://marketing.etorostatic.com/cache1/pdf/eToro-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\n6.71% of Etoro shareholders own GME. source is screenshot from OPs post:  [https://preview.redd.it/ksbd4yfkwg271.png?width=283&format=png&auto=webp&s=de99df2f930e57711e0c04e685a08364ddd19bb3](https://preview.redd.it/ksbd4yfkwg271.png?width=283&format=png&auto=webp&s=de99df2f930e57711e0c04e685a08364ddd19bb3) \n\n6.71% of 1.2 million is  80,520 Etoro funded accounts that hold GME. \n\n According to this email.....[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmos5k/what\\_the\\_actual\\_fuck\\_did\\_etoro\\_just\\_say/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmos5k/what_the_actual_fuck_did_etoro_just_say/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) .... Etoro represents 1.5% of all GME shareholders\n\nSo if 80,520 GME shareholders represent 1.5% of all GME shareholders, **the new estimate is 5,368,000 total GME shareholders (80,520/1.5%). Much lower than 89 Million.**\n\nThink about it,  6.71% of 20 million is 1,342,000 million accounts.  Right there that should tell you the data is wrong if over 100% of Etoro accounts would have to own GME for his math to work.  \n\nAgain this is just an estimate so take it with a grain of salt.  Its also important to note that we are making this estimate off of only 1.5% of the data, so there is PLENTY of room for error here.   Feel free to check my math and let me know if I went wrong somewhere, but my main goal here was to stop the spread of misinformation.",
