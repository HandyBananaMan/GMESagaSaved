<h1>Title: ATTENTION: I BELIEVE u/thebadsanta's POST ABOUT AN ESTIMATED 89 MILLION GME SHAREHOLDERS IS VERY WRONG. MY ESTIMATE IS 5.368 MILLION GME SHAREHOLDERS. SEE MATH BELOW:</h1>

<p>TLDR: Etoro has about 1.2 million TOTAL funded shareholder accounts.  His calculation is based off of 1.2 million Etoro shareholders that own GME.  </p>
<h1>New Estimate:</h1>
<p>This is the post I'm referencing: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np4wwu/etoro_got_their_15_of_all_gme_holder_straight/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/np4wwu/etoro_got_their_15_of_all_gme_holder_straight/</a></p>
<p>Etoro has 1.2 million funded accounts (page 5) <a href="https://marketing.etorostatic.com/cache1/pdf/eToro-Investor-Presentation.pdf">https://marketing.etorostatic.com/cache1/pdf/eToro-Investor-Presentation.pdf</a></p>
<p>6.71% of Etoro shareholders own GME. source is screenshot from OPs post:  <img alt="https://preview.redd.it/ksbd4yfkwg271.png?width=283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de99df2f930e57711e0c04e685a08364ddd19bb3" src="https://preview.redd.it/ksbd4yfkwg271.png?width=283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de99df2f930e57711e0c04e685a08364ddd19bb3" /> </p>
<p>6.71% of 1.2 million is  80,520 Etoro funded accounts that hold GME. </p>
<p>According to this email.....<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmos5k/what_the_actual_fuck_did_etoro_just_say/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nmos5k/what_the_actual_fuck_did_etoro_just_say/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</a> .... Etoro represents 1.5% of all GME shareholders</p>
<p>So if 80,520 GME shareholders represent 1.5% of all GME shareholders, <strong>the new estimate is 5,368,000 total GME shareholders (80,520/1.5%). Much lower than 89 Million.</strong></p>
<p>Think about it,  6.71% of 20 million is 1,342,000 million accounts.  Right there that should tell you the data is wrong if over 100% of Etoro accounts would have to own GME for his math to work.  </p>
<p>Again this is just an estimate so take it with a grain of salt.  Its also important to note that we are making this estimate off of only 1.5% of the data, so there is PLENTY of room for error here.   Feel free to check my math and let me know if I went wrong somewhere, but my main goal here was to stop the spread of misinformation.</p>
