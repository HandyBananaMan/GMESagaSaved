<p>Either FUD or plain retarded. 
    (Edit2: seems more like op got over excited and was not trying to spread FUD. Still false info on his/her part tho)</p>
<p>literally this whole theory hinges on some random customer service rep from Etoro. We're smarter than this nonsense, you'd have to genuinely be retarded to believe this. </p>
<p>They'd love for us to think the short is sooo bad that fighting our ass off to vote isn't worth it or figuring it out isn't worth it. </p>
<p>but if you want hard numbers, does it seem reasonable to you that like 3% of the entire world's 20+ population owns GME? Keep in mind the majority of these people are in Africa/India/SA and other developing or undeveloped countries</p>
<p>does it seem believable that the average Etoro user owns less than 1 share? </p>
<p>cmon guys. use fucking common sense. this sub brought to the world HOC1-3 and other masterpiece DDs. Crackpot retardation like this should not be upvoted, especially when the key info is a fucking customer service rep who's probably working from India and doesn't know wtf is going on</p>
<p>Edit: lol etoro literally says 96k https://i.imgur.com/yNPsSb6.jpg</p>
<p>The other post about this topic also confirms 96k holders (https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/npcczs/etoro_misinformation_etoro_does_not_have_13m/)</p>
