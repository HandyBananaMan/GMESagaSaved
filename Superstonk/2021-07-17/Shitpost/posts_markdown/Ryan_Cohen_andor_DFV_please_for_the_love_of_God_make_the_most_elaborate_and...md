Just tweet anything at all. We can do black and white again, legos, fucking bionicles, I dgaf. Tweet a cat dressed as an astronaut. Fucking tweet a picture of the last shit you took, whatever it takes man. I can only downvote mod drama and apefest bs for so long. This nonsense has gone on for too long.
 
I'm kind of drunk, but whatever. 250 character limit, uhhh pay your retail employees more and provide better staffing. The Gamestop subreddit is fucking depressing and those guys could use some help. How can you expect retail employees to provide exceptional customer service if they hate their jobs? 
 
Crypto is cool and all, but I went out of my way to buy the power up rewards stuff and the app failed at checkout. Get some eyes on that, idk. 
 
Is that 250? Whatever, just tweet something god damn. I'll name my next kid Gamestop if you send a tweet out about nft.
 
Looks like I've still got 5 minutes left before I can submit. I'm just going to rant I guess. Dude literally say anything. I know corporate world moves a lot slower than internet world but come on. Give us a date to hype, a goal post to look at, fucking anything. I can buy and hold forever, but this place is getting depressing. Fucking shills all up in here with mod drama that I can't be bothered with. 
 
I think I can submit now. Cool. Anyway, tweet a pic of your next sandwich or something so we can hypothesize about the meaning of your French dip.
