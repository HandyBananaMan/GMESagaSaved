Are the FTDs now subject to the T+2 settlement date, or did they successfully kick the can down the road one last time and we have to wait for T+35? It was my understanding that DTCC 005 eliminated the ability to kick the can with puts, now SHF are subject to regular T+2.   
  
I'm fully admit I am confused.
