<p>I think you guys have already seen this chart from u/_rerun984 showing us dates after big FTDs and their T+35s.</p>

<p>What they didn't know is that Reg SHO <img alt="FTD cycles are based on CALENDAR days and not business days." src="https://i.imgur.com/pJt2ikU.png" /></p>
<p>So, the closest one from June 18th falls down to <strong>July 23rd</strong>, not July 26th.</p>
<p>I can't edit the chart, so I hope the OP does it and reposts the correct one :)</p>
