    "selftext": "I am successfully mining ETH for GME. Everything that was said in regards to me wasting my time was FUD. My miner is accepting the code and mining Ether into GME's NFT wallet with zero reversions!\n\nI noticed the disgraced Superstonk soon-to-be-ex-mod Madie has tweeted in response to my Ethereum mining post, attempting to debunk it. The code Madie uses in this post is not the correct code.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Madie falsely debunks my ETH mining post intentionally using the wrong code](https://preview.redd.it/fxmzs4kmzvb71.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=5441c5389852837a9a3daf3e61280101dbf57dfc)\n\nThe code she uses is not a working wallet address. It is a contract code. Anyone who mines would know that. I doubt Madie mines at all. The working code is:  [0x10b16eede03cf73cbf44e4bfffa3e6bff36f1fad](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10b16eede03cf73cbf44e4bfffa3e6bff36f1fad)\n\nYou can see that this working code is the code used in my post explaining what I am doing:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojeygl/im\\_relatively\\_sure\\_ive\\_been\\_gpu\\_mining\\_ethereum/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojeygl/im_relatively_sure_ive_been_gpu_mining_ethereum/)\n\nI am now entirely sure that I am successfully mining ETH for GME. I challenge anyone to plug this address into their miner and tell me it is not working. I wasn't suggesting anyone follow me down this path before, but I am now. This is 100% working.\n\n\\*\\*Keep in mind that you will not be able to claim anything you mine to this address. Consider any Ethereum mined to this address to be a donation.\\*\\*\n\nLove all Apes. We're not fucking leaving!",
