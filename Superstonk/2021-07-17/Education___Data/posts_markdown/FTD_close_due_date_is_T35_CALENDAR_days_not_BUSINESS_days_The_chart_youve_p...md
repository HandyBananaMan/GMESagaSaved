# Title: FTD close due date is T+35 CALENDAR days, not BUSINESS days. The chart you've probably all seen is wrong.

I think you guys have already seen this chart from u/_rerun984 showing us dates after big FTDs and their T+35s.

What they didn't know is that Reg SHO ![FTD cycles are based on CALENDAR days and not business days.](https://i.imgur.com/pJt2ikU.png)

So, the closest one from June 18th falls down to **July 23rd**, not July 26th.

I can't edit the chart, so I hope the OP does it and reposts the correct one :)
