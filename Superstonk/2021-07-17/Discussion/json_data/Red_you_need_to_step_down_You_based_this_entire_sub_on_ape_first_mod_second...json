You need to get your head out of your ass and back down in reality and do the right thing, step down. Don\u2019t shit on everything everyone has contributed to this sub for your own ego trip. You made a mistake. Make it as right as you can moving forward.",

Do it for the professionals that gave their time and insight and aligned themselves with this sub. DO IT FOR THE STOCK.",
