<p>Look at the <a href="https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?pagenumber=80">Gamestop Careers Page</a>. There are an absolutely insane amount of job listings up for retail stores across the nation. These are mostly store staff listings meaning they're probably planning on rolling out the initiative they did earlier (regarding the new store designs).  </p>
<p>Sounds like Gamestop is about to be an EVEN BETTER investment. As if them turning into a better version of NewEgg already, redesigning their app and website and massively improving the customer experience wasn't initiative enough. Seriously, their old website was slow as shit. <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/">Browse the new one</a>.  </p>
<p>Also amidst all the drama, remember what DFV believes. The squeeze will happen eventually, but Gamestop is going to see incredible growth regardless with this team behind it. Their earnings KILLED IT.  </p>
<p>Buy. Hold. Support the company. Enjoy watching this company grow. Because they're about to do something big (again).</p>
