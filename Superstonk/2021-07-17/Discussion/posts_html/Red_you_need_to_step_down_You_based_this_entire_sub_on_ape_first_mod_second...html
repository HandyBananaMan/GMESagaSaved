<h1>Title: Red, you need to step down. You based this entire sub on “ape first, mod second” and “be excellent to each other”. You are being the antithesis of excellent. Do it for the professionals that gave their time and insight and aligned themselves with this sub. DO IT FOR THE STOCK.</h1>

<p>Why on earth would being a moderator of a sub on a website give you a power trip. You need to get your head out of your ass and back down in reality and do the right thing, step down. Don’t shit on everything everyone has contributed to this sub for your own ego trip. You made a mistake. Make it as right as you can moving forward.</p>
