<p>Mods have crumbled, Shills have breached the walls.</p>
<p>ALL THAT MATTERS is the DD! Its the reason they are trying to split everyone up. To stop people figuring everything out and telling each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0me5bzdqze94xu0/GME%20DD%20BACKUP%20July7.pdf?dl=0">Here is a link to a 670 page PDF doc</a> I found a week or so ago (the link has now been deleted) but I saved it and have reuploaded here.</p>
<p>Download and spread as far as possible.</p>
<p>EDIT: If you wanna have the actual URL it is here:<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0me5bzdqze94xu0/GME%20DD%20BACKUP%20July7.pdf?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/0me5bzdqze94xu0/GME%20DD%20BACKUP%20July7.pdf?dl=0</a>  </p>
