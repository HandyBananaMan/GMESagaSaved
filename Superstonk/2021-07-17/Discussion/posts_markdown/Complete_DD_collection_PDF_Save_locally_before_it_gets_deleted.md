Mods have crumbled, Shills have breached the walls.

ALL THAT MATTERS is the DD! Its the reason they are trying to split everyone up. To stop people figuring everything out and telling each other.

[Here is a link to a 670 page PDF doc](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0me5bzdqze94xu0/GME%20DD%20BACKUP%20July7.pdf?dl=0) I found a week or so ago (the link has now been deleted) but I saved it and have reuploaded here.

Download and spread as far as possible.

EDIT: If you wanna have the actual URL it is here:[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0me5bzdqze94xu0/GME%20DD%20BACKUP%20July7.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0me5bzdqze94xu0/GME%20DD%20BACKUP%20July7.pdf?dl=0)
