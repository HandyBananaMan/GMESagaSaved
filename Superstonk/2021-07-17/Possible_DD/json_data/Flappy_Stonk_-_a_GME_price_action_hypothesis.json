    "selftext": "Based on my previous thread:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oktyvl/deathspiral_for_shorts_to_stay_short_the_price/\n\n**for shorts to keep shorting, the price must fall**\n\n______\n\n**inverse price action:**\n\nThis hypothesis simply put explains that the price of GME will go lower, the more retail investors buy.\n\nIn my previous post I explained a thought I had right after going to bed like 2 days ago, and tyoed it out on my phone. **Why will buying lead to price drops you ask?**\n\nBecause at this point, it should be clear that Short Hedge Funds are more or less able to control the price entirely, by selectively routing buy orders through dark pools. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that this is the case.\n\nIn order for hedge funds to keep naked shorting, either through Married Puts (tricky with new regulations), ETFs (as hypothesized in the Castle Of Glass DD), or other mechanisms, they have to manipulate the price down, or they will fail liquidity checks.\n\nIn fact, with the 400k put options expiring worthless, that is next week a 60% SI increase showing up on their books again.\n\nTheir short debt is equal to their outstanding short shares multiplied by the price. As the short interest increases, they MUST reduce the price at which they sell new synthetic shares to manipulate the price of GME down, to maintain the same debt - otherwise they risk failing liquidity checks or being forced to increase their margin account (covering).\n\nShorts can cover so long as they have assets to enter into margin as collateral.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, assuming other variables stay constant, when the SI% doubles, the price of GME must be reduced to half, or SHF must double their collateral.\n\nI hypothesise that they will use a combination, once the 40mil hidden January shorts appear back on their books next week, and that** this will lead to both them manipulating the price down and increasing their margin.**\n\n______\n\n**It's a trap: Apes may get discouraged seeing a price drop when it may be a sign MOASS is getting closer**\n\nBut remember, for shorts to keep shorting, they are Forced to drop the price by selling their synthetic shares cheaper, to not run out of margin.\n\n100 million shares at 300USD and 300 million shares at 100USD represent the same debt...\n\nIntuition may tell you that the price drops because people are selling, but in this case, I believe the reason could be the exact opposite - because Apes keep buying and SHF literally have no choice but to keep selling cheaper and cheaper.\n\n**Idiosyncratic risk indeed**\n\n_____\n\n**Downward price trend regardless of buy/sell ratio**\n\nThis is everyone's chance to average down. Because of the theory I presented here, I expect the price of GME to drop steadily until a catalyst triggers MOASS or SHF increase their margin, which increases their safe price levels temporarily.\n\nIf SHF extend their margin, they can safely let the price tick up again to a ratio of the current price correspondent to their percentage margin increase (up until they have collateramized all assets). This means we may see another spike into 250-350 and yet another dip before GME moons, assuming people keep buying and holding.\n\n**This can take a while... So never forget that the price going down doesn't mean GME holders are not winning**\n\n_____\n\n**Flappy Stonk**\n\nWhat it comes down to is that SHF are essentially playing a game of Flappy Bird with the price of GME, with the upper limit being their liquidity tests or Marge calling, and the lower limit being the risk of increased buying pressure from Retail. They have to keep the price inside this band, and they have two controls - shorting to drop the price in a parabolic curve down, and doing nothing, to let the price rocket up (straight up).\n\nThe upper part of the gates will drop down as SI% increases (people keep buying and holding), and the lower part of the gates will rise upwards as Ryan Cohen increases the value if the company in real time, for everyone to see, and buy pressure increases.\n\nAs SI% increases, their safe gaps for stock price narrows down, and their vulnerability to catalysts multiplies until...\n\n**Game Over**\n\n______\n\n**TL;DR**: apes buying shares forces SHF to manipulate the price down, making it cheaper to make it harder for them to keep the price safely between margin limits and a price where buy pressure explodes. **this means the more shares retail investors buy, the lower the price will dip, displaying inverse price action compared to other securities** until it eventually triggers MOASS. SHF may try delaying for another round or two by increasing their margin - they are playing the long con, and if you see the price drop, that doesn't mean apes are not winning. They have zero counterplays to **BUY AND HOLD**\n\n____\n\nI would love all feedback or reviews of the validity of this hypothesis. I realize it is very close to my previous post, but I hope to get some more perspective. None of this is financial advice.",
