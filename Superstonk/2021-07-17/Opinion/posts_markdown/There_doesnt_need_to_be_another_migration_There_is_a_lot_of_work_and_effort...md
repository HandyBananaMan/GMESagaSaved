# Title: There doesn't need to be another migration. There is a lot of work and effort put into this sub (like Satori) that shouldn't go to waste. Just remove the problem. Ape first, mod second, right?

It's been a while since mods have gone full silent, (which I understand you have to talk as a team and all) but it really is simple as that, red and madie should step down or be removed. Don't make the problem worse than it already is and accept that you messed up.  
Because the way things are looking right now, another migration is very possible. Mods are replaceable. The sub is too, but it doesn't need to die.  

If you really are apes first and mods second, now's the chance to prove it.
