I doubt my complaint will amount to anything, but I feel a little better now. Too many "bugs" and coincidences surrounding the Brazilian puts for my taste. I filed a complaint under the SEC Whistleblower Program ([https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip](https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip)). Could care less about a potential award - I have enough GME shares to retire comfortably. I'd just love to see a little justice.

Many thanks to the apes who provided feedback to the 'Brazilian Puts' posts (bottom), but especially to u/Criand, u/Broccaaa, u/wladeczek44, u/ammoprofit, u/LordSnufkin, u/GuitarEvil, u/Effective-Island8395,
