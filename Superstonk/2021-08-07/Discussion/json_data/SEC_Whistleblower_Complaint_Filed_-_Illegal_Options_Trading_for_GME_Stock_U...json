I filed a complaint under the SEC Whistleblower Program ([https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip](https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip)).

I'd just love to see a little justice.\n\nMany thanks to the apes who provided feedback to the 'Brazilian Puts' posts (bottom), but especially to u/Criand, u/Broccaaa, u/wladeczek44, u/ammoprofit, u/LordSnufkin, u/GuitarEvil, u/Effective-Island8395,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wq27vqop20g71.jpg?width=1151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a84e8392155ec26831d6c9e0bef6c2b0be548baa\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ozekd5/brazilian\\_puts\\_bloomberg\\_follow\\_up\\_none\\_of\\_those/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ozekd5/brazilian_puts_bloomberg_follow_up_none_of_those/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxv148/brazilian\\_puts\\_bloomberg\\_says\\_they\\_were\\_a\\_bug\\_and/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxv148/brazilian_puts_bloomberg_says_they_were_a_bug_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovaorq/credit\\_suisse\\_put\\_options\\_540k\\_gone\\_in\\_bloomberg/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovaorq/credit_suisse_put_options_540k_gone_in_bloomberg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovf7ab/historical\\_put\\_positions\\_in\\_july\\_bloomberg/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovf7ab/historical_put_positions_in_july_bloomberg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**TL;DR** Filed SEC Whistleblower complaint for Illegal Options Trading for $GME Stock Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Comments/questions about whistleblowers: [https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower](https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower)\n\n\u201cThe Commission is authorized by Congress to provide monetary awards to eligible individuals who come forward with high-quality original information that leads to a Commission enforcement action\u2026\u201d",
