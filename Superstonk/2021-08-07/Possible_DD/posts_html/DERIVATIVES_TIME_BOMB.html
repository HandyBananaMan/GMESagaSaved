<p>What Is a Derivatives Time Bomb?
"Derivatives time bomb" is a descriptive term for possible market mayhem if there is a sudden, as opposed to orderly, unwinding of massive derivatives positions. "Time bomb" as a reference to derivatives is a moniker attributable to Warren Buffett. In 2016 in the annual Berkshire Hathaway company meeting, the legendary investor warned that the state of the derivatives market was "still a potential time bomb in the system if you were to get a discontinuity or severe market stress."</p>

<p>So what does this mean? Buffetâ€™s prescient ass called this back 2002 and here we are, $188 trillion in derivatives currently in the market right now and the Fed has &lt; $500 billion left in cash. All this, with our singular idiosyncratic security ready to light the fuse any day. </p>
