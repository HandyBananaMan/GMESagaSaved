    "selftext": "What Is a Derivatives Time Bomb?\n\"Derivatives time bomb\" is a descriptive term for possible market mayhem if there is a sudden, as opposed to orderly, unwinding of massive derivatives positions. \"Time bomb\" as a reference to derivatives is a moniker attributable to Warren Buffett. In 2016 in the annual Berkshire Hathaway company meeting, the legendary investor warned that the state of the derivatives market was \"still a potential time bomb in the system if you were to get a discontinuity or severe market stress.\"\n\n[Investopedia Derivatives Timb Bomb](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivativestimebomb.asp)\n\nSo what does this mean? Buffet\u2019s prescient ass called this back 2002 and here we are, $188 trillion in derivatives currently in the market right now and the Fed has < $500 billion left in cash. All this, with our singular idiosyncratic security ready to light the fuse any day. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oyyour/heard_you_like_some_derivatives_but_do_you_like/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\n- \u201cDerivatives time bomb\" refers to a possible market deterioration if there is a sudden unwinding of derivatives positions.\n\n- The term is credited to legendary investor Warren Buffett who believes that derivatives are \"financial weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\n- A derivative is a financial contract whose value is tied to an underlying asset. Common derivatives include futures contracts and options.\n\n- Derivatives can be used to hedge price risk as well as for speculative trading to make profits.\n\n- The 2008 financial crisis was primarily caused by derivatives in the mortgage market.\n\n - The issues with derivatives arise when investors hold too many, being overleveraged, and are not able to meet margin calls if the value of the derivative moves against them.  \n\nAny of that sound familiar apes?  We are witnessing a perfect storm with the ever growing naked SI, increasing regulatory pressure on the SHFs, and an over leveraged market propped up on IOU\u2019s.  We\u2019re one NFT dividend, COVID shut down, or margin call away from launch. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nHodl!!",
