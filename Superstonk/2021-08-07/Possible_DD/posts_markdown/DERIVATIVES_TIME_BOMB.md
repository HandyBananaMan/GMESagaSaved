What Is a Derivatives Time Bomb?
"Derivatives time bomb" is a descriptive term for possible market mayhem if there is a sudden, as opposed to orderly, unwinding of massive derivatives positions. "Time bomb" as a reference to derivatives is a moniker attributable to Warren Buffett. In 2016 in the annual Berkshire Hathaway company meeting, the legendary investor warned that the state of the derivatives market was "still a potential time bomb in the system if you were to get a discontinuity or severe market stress."

So what does this mean? Buffetâ€™s prescient ass called this back 2002 and here we are, $188 trillion in derivatives currently in the market right now and the Fed has < $500 billion left in cash. All this, with our singular idiosyncratic security ready to light the fuse any day.

Any of that sound familiar apes?  We are witnessing a perfect storm with the ever growing naked SI, increasing regulatory pressure on the SHFs, and an over leveraged market propped up on IOUâ€™s.  Weâ€™re one NFT dividend, COVID shut down, or margin call away from launch. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
