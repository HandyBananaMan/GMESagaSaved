    "selftext": "Sup fellow Apes, \n\nLet me first say I\u2019m a basic AF ape. I\u2019m only 8 months old for goodness sakes. \n\nI\u2019m out here in the old RV, not able to sleep through the witching hour, melting crayons in my coffee and thinking about our favorite stonk.\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend I understand all the ins and outs of the potential ETH NFT dividend. \n\nBut I think it\u2019s outrageous that GME or any other company would have to execute extraordinary measures, 4D chess moves or stick bananas in tailpipes in order for their value to be accurately reflected in the market. What planet are we on (for now)?!\n\nPlease do not mistake my sentiments as a lobby against GME making any such moves. Not what I\u2019m advocating. \n\nI 100% trust in RC and the rock star team assembled at GameStop. And I imagine the NFT dividend and related technologies are integral to GME\u2019s business plan and future. So again, do your thang RC & Co. \n\nI\u2019m just frustrated that GameStop can\u2019t just focus on being the best company ever; they\u2019ve got to do that AND consider how to navigate this absurdly corrupt financial landscape and uphold their responsibilities to shareholders. As if the first isn\u2019t difficult enough.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t wait to one day sit back and say to myself, \u201cthose crazy MFs actually did it.\u201d \n\nWhat I\u2019d really like to see is the SEC and GG come out and TAKE ACTION to end all the fuckery.\n\nLike this:\n\n\u201cDue to the ungodly amount of synthetic shares illegally created, vote count at xxx,xxx,xxx or more, blatant naked shorting, dark pool abuse and market maker privilege abuse all coupled with GameStop\u2019s beautiful fundamentals including zero debt, movement to S&P 400, solid future and business plan, I am forcing all shorts to close by the end of 2021 to accurately reflect GameStop\u2019s value in the market.\u201d\n\nOk so yeah maybe that would never happen. I clearly don\u2019t understand market intricacies. \n\nBut long story short, it should not be GameStop\u2019s responsibility to ensure the company\u2019s value is accurately reflected in the market.\n\nPower to the players",
