    "selftext": "# Preface\n\nI\u2019ve been heavily interested in the workings of the Fed since March. Thanks to u/leisure_rules, I\u2019ve started looking through OCC data - including large commercial banks.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve posted notional values of derivatives within the US market - something that should frighten all of you. I believe Goldman Sachs is in a large pickle, having nearly 200:1 leverage ratio and a 75% reduction in assets since 2019. Either GS or the other two (smaller) banks that are incredibly over-leveraged are likely the first to fall.\n\nWith the recent unconstitutional moratorium extension, I decided to take a look at what is really going on in the backend. I also speculate that the large firms are behind the push to extend the moratorium, as a large enough default rate will reduce household prices, reducing the values of their assets, and will actually cause them to be margin called.\n\n[Marge doing some practice runs](https://preview.redd.it/1lxvzcw61zf71.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=f583455bb986caaf84cb80b157c601fa732d22e4)\n\n# TL;DR;\n\nYou\u2019ve been lied to about demand. Nobody seems to be getting new mortgages, rather it seems (indirectly) that our future owners (BlackRock & BlackStone) are actually the ones that are causing the whole demand to be built up. If we get a large-enough default rate, margins will start calling.\n\nSauce: [https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/mortgage-metrics-reports/files/pub-mortgage-metrics-q1-2021.pdf](https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/mortgage-metrics-reports/files/pub-mortgage-metrics-q1-2021.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Appetizer\n\nI\u2019ll paraphrase the document above for you and attempt to prove a thesis that you have been lied to.\n\n**What are mortgage metrics**\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) collects data on first-lien residential mortgage loans serviced by seven national banks with large mortgage-servicing portfolios and is reported quarterly to \u201cpromote broader understanding of mortgage portfolio performance and modification activity in the federal banking system, support supervision of regulated institutions, and fulfill section 104 of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 (codified at 12 USC 1715z-25), as amended by section 1493(a) of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\u201d\n\nBefore the third quarter of 2019, certain banks reported completed,post-foreclosure,and other real estate owned (OREO) accounts in data used in figures 1 through 4. These accounts should not have been included in those figures. These discrepancies were not material.\n\n# Sauce\n\nAs of March 31, 2021 the banks have serviced 13.2m first-lien residential mortgages valued at $2.64T of principal balances (This is the total mortgage balance, less interest).\n\nThe mortgage performance declined compared to when the pandemic started, and as a result CARES Act was enacted in March-2020 to provide customer relief, allowing forbearance extensions up to 18 months.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, despite eviction moratorium, there were 833 new foreclosures initiated - a decline of 96% compared to the year prior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Newly Initiated Foreclosures](https://preview.redd.it/juabeynd1zf71.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=10db900465f00d45587b50fc329a791e05ea7f90)\n\nAmong the initiated foreclosures, we\u2019ve seen a significant amount of foreclosures that were completed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Completed Foreclosures](https://preview.redd.it/dep8qfnh1zf71.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f20a2a4e3d6d90ad12ba5a63d70cb04473c0ee)\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that there is a large number of mortgages that are in default > 90 days. Now, the banks (due to the foreclosures) are actually reaching out to the individual homeowners (likely as a result of the CARES Act) and are offering modifications (reduced interest rates or payment amounts or both).\n\nIn the first quarter, there were close to 48,000 modifications made, an increase from 41,000 from the previous quarter.\n\nWithin those modifications, there were:\n\n* 27,500 \u201ccombination modifications\u201d (modifications that include multiple actions to affect the affordability and sustainability of the loan (the both))\n* 20,000 received a single action (rate reduction or term extension) with about 9,400 receiving rate reduction\n* 188 received no modification\n\nSo, you can see here - the banks are really trying to avoid having their underlying assets from being dumped. From my previous post, there are a ton of derivatives being in play and IMO the banks have no other choice but to actually work with the homeowners to prevent the shitstorm.\n\n**Now, why I think you\u2019ve been lied to about the demand being high but the supply low by the individual investors.**\n\nOCC tracks the total serviced mortgage portfolio, specifically outstanding principal and number of loans that the banks offer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Number of outstanding principal has decreased by $400Bn since Q1-2020](https://preview.redd.it/7sjfuajn1zf71.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb2cc6cb7eb43c8c356ba922787847ceccc7bcf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[And the number of loans have decreased by 2,200 since Q1-2020.](https://preview.redd.it/pgt8gmip1zf71.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca94f6ec6bd995785e2d76e5e194e00b74d8bfcb)\n\nWhich means that the regular people are no longer getting loans to get a mortgage. Despite you hearing that the market is hot, I am no longer in belief that this is a result of regular people and the impact of BlackRock and friends is significantly under reported.\n\n\\[Edit 1\\] Now, some of you questioned that the actual supply is down, to show a further proof that we should not be seeing such low new loans by new home owners when new residential housing has actually stayed consistent since 2017, barely hit by COVID, and have gone up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.census.gov\\/construction\\/nrc\\/pdf\\/newresconst.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/n9hncsz0x0g71.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=17888837512278528734e654564ba3a40c30353c)\n\nI do not believe that the underlying assets of mortgages will actually have a chance of going down, unless our economy goes to shit as the Prime mortgages actually compose about 94% of all mortgages and are unlikely to be fraudulently reported after the shenanigans of 2008.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ru6n7vdv1zf71.png?width=1214&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f0a59ff9953bbba5f7d0dfb9aca5a95e1caeecc\n\nIn the current quarter, we have approximately 4.6% of all mortgage loans that are seriously delinquent. And 94% of all loans are current and performing.\n\nIf anything happens, the likely states that will be affected are:\n\n* California (no surprise) having 25% of all mortgage modification actions\n* Texas with having \\~8% of all mortgage modification actions (4x less than Cali)\n* Florida with having about the same amount as Texas\n\nAll eyes should be on California, because If shit really hits the fan, California will be the first to light the fires.",
