    "selftext": "Good Morning, Afternoon & Evening Apes!\n\nFirst of all - Thank you to all those kind people that commented and messaged me after my post about some of the inner workings of the media world. I had so many very interesting people reach out - it really is fascinating how many people from all walks of life are here among us.\n\nIf you missed it - [you can read it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojhgph/a_journalists_view_on_gme/)\n\nSecond - before I get into the main body about this post I wanted to address some of the people that said I was a fraud, fake etc.\n\nAs requested - I provided undeniable proof to u/broccaaa\n\nThis included 10 years worth of press passes, journalist entry visas for multiple countries in Asia, North America, Europe & The Middle East, along with pictures of my awards with the u/Broccaaa user name next to them. I totally understand the desire for proof - and I delivered that to an admin of the page.\n\nFor those who were trying to deconstruct my post and looked for grammatical mistakes and \"syntax\" issues with how I construct a sentence - You're right! I am a horrible writer. Many of you seem to have it in your head that you MUST be able to write perfectly to be a journalist - this is simply not true. Even the ones that are \"writers\" many time are not the best at putting pen to paper... it takes a team for stories to come out. Editors, Sub Editors, Writers, Management, Lawyers. When you see a story on the TV or in a newspaper, dozens, sometimes hundreds of people could have been involved in what you are watching. Everyone is a cog in the system to make the machine work.  So yeah - I'm not the best writer. Many of you are also assuming English is my first language as well... so I will leave it at that.\n\nAnd to the one guy that said there was no way I could be a journalist because I swore in my post - Holy Fuck. Your mind would explode if you worked a day in a news organisation.\n\n**A QUICK HISTORY LESSON - THE BIRTH OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE NEWSROOM**\n\nWe live in an AMAZING time. Every thing that is ever muttered on television or written online is saved forever.\n\nIt use to be the case not that long ago that once a news segment went to air - that was it. It would never, ever be seen again. That interview with that \"xyz politician\" was on TV just once. There was no ability for the average citizen to fact check someone about what they said, or a promise they made - because the evidence of anything that was said was locked away in the TV Archives department. Same goes with newspapers & magazines - most people would keep a newspaper for a day or two, and after that it was gone.\n\nNow - with the power of both people and the internet, everything lives forever - for better or for worse.\n\nMany people within news organisations still don't really live in this reality - that everything that is said lives forever.\n\nQuick story time - when Facebook, YouTube, Twitter started coming out in 2004 onwards - I was a very early user. I went to upper management at a few of the companies I worked for and told them we needed to have a Facebook page for share news stories, or needed a YouTube page to share interviews & stories.\n\nThese companies love control over their product. They love to control the content and when it comes out, and how it was distributed. The idea that something could be pushed out live to the whole world and never be deleted was a very scary, and foreign concept for some of these people. I was told multiple times when I went into these meetings trying to get these organisations onto social media \"People can just go to our website, they can find what we publish there\" There was a famous case a few years ago where something happened on a large TV Network and it was all over YouTube - behind the scenes one of the older executives demanded and was screaming that the footage must be taken down from \"the internet\" - with no comprehension that this is impossible. In their mind - if you wanted it deleted, it would just be deleted.\n\n**THE MYSTERIOUS CASE OF THE CNBC INTERVIEWS PART 1 - GME HEARING**\n\nOkay, now we have that out of the way - I wanted to tell you my thoughts on these mysterious interviews... there is WAY more going on here then meets the eye.\n\nLet me go through the process of a video and how it ends up on YouTube, Social Media etc.\n\nAll major media organisations now have specialists that work purely on social media. They are teams of people that develop content that will get traction on social media, with the goal being to click through to the website to read the story / watch the video etc. Or if it's a pre recorded interview, you might tease out a few juicy parts from the interview on social to get people talking - with the idea being to promote a story or interview that will be on in the morning.\n\nNow - let's say I was a senior person on shift at CNBC social desk on 3/17/2021 when the hearing into GameStop was happening on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis is a such an easy upload for me - first of all because there this is a public hearing, there is no copyright issues to deal with.\n\nSecond of all it's just one big video. Hours and hours of hearing - I would probably edit out the bathroom / lunch breaks, but as for the content - just let it run! This is not a highlight reel of the hearing, or a summary piece. It's like a press conference that a the White House would give, I simply tell the video editors to cut the top to where it starts, and the end when it finished. Done - I can go to the vending machine and get a soda.\n\n**This is where it gets really fucking weird.**\n\nAs many of you know - there was VERY important details cut from this hearing.[Here is a side by side view](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7vbli/video_proof_cnbc_edited_the_hearing_to_protect/)\n\n[And here is a bit about what was cut out](https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/cnbc-posts-edited-video-house-financial-services-gamestop-hearing-deleting-dennis-kelleher)\n\nThere is ZERO logical reason if I was uploading an entire press conference, or congressional hearing to cut out just one little bit.\n\nIf I was doing a highlight reel, I would get the timecodes of the best parts of the hearing - and I would hand them to a video editor.\n\nSo for example I would send an email to a video editor;\n\n*Hey Bob the Video Editor,*\n\n*Hope your day is going great.*\n\n*Can you cut a social video for me? It's a highlight reel of todays congressional hearing on GameStop.It's a big clip and I want the entire hearing, but could you cut out the following for me? Here are the bits that I want to be left out of the final version for social.*\n\n* *04:20:69 - 04:45:00 - In words \"I am\" - Out Words \"Not a cat\"*\n* *04:50:00 - 04:53:24 - In words \"I Like\" - Out Words \"the stock\"*\n\n*Let me Know when it's ready, we want to push it onto YouTube as quickly as possible. Thank you!*\n\nThis is just an example, but you get the picture. I would give detailed timecode's & in and out timecode's for where my video editors could find the footage.\n\n**SOMEONE, WITHIN CNBC, GAVE A SOCIAL MEDIA JOURNALIST, OR A VIDEO EDITOR SPECIFIC TIMECODE'S TO EDIT OUT. THIS WAS NOT A HIGHLIGHT REEL. THERE WAS NO TIME LIMIT THAT THEY WERE AIMING FOR - THEY CUT THIS OUT FOR A SPECIFIC REASON.**\n\n**THIS IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL.** I don't know how high it went, or who within CNBC would have called down to the senior that was on duty that day - but someone within that organisation said \"we cant have xyz in the full video\" Did someone from outside the organisation call someone within the management team of CNBC and ask for XYZ to not be included? We will probably never know - but this smells of something much bigger.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous post - these organisations are run top down fear style leadership. I highly doubt anyone would have pushed back or questioned this request - boss man said to not include xyz, so I wont include xyz. I get to keep my decent salary, and after work I am going to go try that new expensive restaurant around the corner. Case Closed - Day over.\n\nThe ONLY reason I can think was maybe Standards and Practices had an issue with something? A quick rundown on Standards & Practices within a news organisation - they are there as lawyers / protectors / gate keepers of the company for what can be published and what can not. They are there to try and make sure that the company is not in trouble legally for anything.\n\n[There is a funny video of Conan with his Standards guy - it's not journalism but you get the point.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIcvnU9t7S0)\n\nWas there something that was said that freaked out CNBC legal department? I don't know... it was a public hearing so there really shouldn't be a legal issue. The fact that they specifically cut out a certain portion means something happened behind the scenes. **A meeting was had, an email was sent, a phone call was placed. Something happened.**\n\n**THE MYSTERIOUS CASE OF THE CNBC INTERVIEWS PART 2 - GARY GENSLER**\n\nAlright now we have that out of the way - I want to talk about the interview with Gary Gensler, and what happened with the editing (again) of the social clips they published.\n\nFinancial news is clearly a very niche area, there really isn't that many news outlets that focus purely on the stock market, bonds, etc. You have CNBC, Bloomberg, Fox Business News etc. So when it comes to financial interviews, getting an exclusive with someone isn't as a big of a deal as it is with Network or Cable (because you have a lot more competition with those guys)\n\nThat being said you can tell by watching their social channels, and also watching the promotions they put up the day before for what they see as exciting, and what will drive viewers. The day before the Gary Gensler interview they started promoting it hard, both on air and also on their social media.\n\nIf I was an executive producer at CNBC, and I had an exclusive that was a high profile person, the big man everyone is talking about online, Gary Gensler, I would do the following. After the interview, I would clip up the best grabs / sound from him - so these could be little 30-40 second clips of the big talking points he made. Each clip could be their own tweet - which in-turn could be retweeted / shared by the anchors / stars on CNBC. My hope is of course for these to go viral / get good traction. More eyes on the network and more publicity.\n\nI would then take the entire interview, clip it from the top to the bottom, and publish that entire exchange on Facebook & YouTube. The longer these clips, the better the engagement. If you get longer engagement with a video, its better for my report at the end of the month.\n\nOnce again - this is where it gets weird.\n\nSomething happened with that raw interview tape - **again**. Somewhere in the chain of command, someone told someone that from time code xx:xx:xx to time code xx:xx:xx needed to be edited out of the clip that would be shared on social. Why the FUCK would you edit out the one thing everyone is talking about? You simply wouldn't. Someone, somewhere, got a phone call, and was told to edit xyz out, and of course they did. Was this a phone call from outside the network, leaning on a friend within the network? Was there pressure from someone else? We will never know. What I do know is that these are deliberate actions, with multiple people behind the chain of command and decision making.\n\n**Now - here is where things get wild.**\n\nWhy do people go on CNBC / TV at all. People don't go on TV for no reason or to say \"Hi Mom, I'm on TV\". There is always a reason. You are either promoting yourself / your own personal brand as an expert, the company you represent, a new announcement, an exciting new venture.... you don't just go on CNBC for the fun of it. There is a reason you get asked to go on, and there is a reason why you say yes.\n\nTV is also a powerful tool, you can bring up things and say things that may not have come up organically in a tweet, or a press release. Because it's a conversation, you can steer the interview into places you want to talk about, and announce things, or allude to things that you probably couldn't just tweet out directly.\n\nCNBC is watching all of this shit carefully, they know the man of the hour is Gary. And Gary know's this is a perfect way to boost his profile within the new job, but also kind of say to retail investors \"hey, I am hearing this, I see you, I got this\"\n\nSo what does he do. He steers the conversation into protecting retail investors, he specifically mentions \"We must guard against fraud and manipulation from big actors, hedgefund and elsewhere\"\n\nAND THEN THE GUY TWEETS THE 1:18 CLIP THAT WAS DELETED FROM CNBC.\n\n**THIS WAS WHAT HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT, CNBC TRIED TO NATURALLY KILL OFF THE CONVERSATION, SO HE SAID FUCK YOU, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN LOUDER, VIA TWITTER - HERES THE CLIP OF WHAT I SAID.**\n\nHe then makes the case that CNBC is no different to Reddit, that the conversations that are had on CNBC at their round table shows about stock fundamentals are no different to what is discussed on Reddit, YouTube etc. This was a POWERFUL message - for a year now CNBC has been shitting on the Reddit bet page because they said it was possibly illegal - and Gary says Fuck you, It's the same as what you do - and btw, we must guard against fraud and manipulation from big actors & hedgefunds. It was a message for three groups\n\n* CNBC & Media - This is no different to you discussing stocks. Don't throw rocks in glasshouses\n* SHF / Big Banks / Wall St- I know what you have done, and I am coming for you.\n* Retail Investors - I know about your concerns, I see them on Twitter and other social channels, and I am working on them.\n\nBetween the words he used, the tweet, and the posting of footage that was censored by CNBC - it was a masterclass in how to go into bat against a big media company & social media.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OPEN SOURCE INVESTIGATIONS / OSINT**\n\nWe live in a powerful time in history - so much data is available for you and your wife's boyfriend to go through from your living room with just a laptop. Billions of data points across any topic you can imagine. In the last 5 years, most major news outlets both print & broadcast have opened in house \"Open Source Investigation Units\". It came clear that with the technology available, and with the right training you could easily start building a story in the same way an intelligence analyst might with an agency. Some of the big boys have even paid for private satellite imagery from time to time to work out what was going in countries like Syria (Yeah thats a thing now - you can pay for a set of eyes in space to take some pictures for you)\n\nFor those who don't know - Open Source Investigations is pretty much what every brilliant ape has done in this group for the last 6 months. They take information from publicly available sources, connect the dots and try and build a story from it.\n\nWe have seen people work out not only intense financial details about certain groups by putting puzzles pieces together, but we have seen people use pictures and imagery data to work here where a photo was taken etc.\n\nThe king kong of publicly available OSINT work is Bellingcat. Their most famous work involved being able to track down individual members of a Russian assassination squad using public records, photos, and even the background from pictures listed on a Russian equivalent to Google Reviews.\n\nThere are some fantastic resources available and guides. If there are\n\n[https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/](https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/)\n\n[https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/how-tos/](https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/how-tos/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a bunch of resources available here:\n\n[https://gijn.org/online-research-tools/](https://gijn.org/online-research-tools/)\n\n[https://www.andyblackassociates.co.uk/resources-andy-black-associates/osint-toolkit/](https://www.andyblackassociates.co.uk/resources-andy-black-associates/osint-toolkit/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSearch for OSINT toolkit, OSINT resources, Open Source Investigations. Find the tools that you like to use, and start building your own toolkit with the tools available at our disposal.\n\n**WHY AM I SHARING THE IDEA BEHING OSINT?**\n\nBecause there are dozens of people that are already doing it without realising it. I think the geniuses in this group should be supported with additional ideas and resources. I would HIGHLY encourage you to read this article - [https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/)\n\nIt was the methodology behind tracking down the FSB hit squad they were tracking using open source information. It really helps you get in the mindset of an open source journalist, and how they use tools and methods to track down information. My favourite quote from this article is *\"Tugging on one thread will unravel an entire tapestry of cross-referenced data\"* GME is an entire tapestry is slowly being unravelled. The more people search, the more people will find.\n\nAlso a side note - when searching, use multiple search engines. It is clear that Google in the last 5 years has started putting individual results for individual people, it might be worth checking out searches in Duck Duck Go and using incognito mode while searching around for information.\n\n**TAKE NOTICE OF THE LANGUAGE & SOCIAL CUES**\n\nPay attention to the words people use on TV, and the meaning behind them.\n\nLanguage is used to draw an audience in - to make a connection with Bruce & Jane sitting in their living room in Smalltown America.\n\nI'll give you an example. If I am writing a story about rising costs of healthcare for the average family, how do I get a news anchor that is making huge money to connect with the family watching who may be on a single income and just on the line between lower and middle class.\n\nI change the language in the story. So instead of saying \"You may have noticed your healthcare costs rising\" - I would change it to \"We have all noticed our healthcare costs rising\"\n\nSee what I did there - I made this about me as well, we and our connects me sitting there at the news desk to you sitting in your living room. We have BOTH noticed the healthcare cost rising. Now I am on a VERY decent salary, with fucking AMAZING healthcare - have I noticed a rise in the prices? Fuck No. But I want YOU to think that I am just a guy like you... so I connect with you through the TV as an everyman.\n\nAnother example is that clown Jim Cramer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sleeves rolled up, a messy man cave. \\\\\"I'm just like you - I am just like your drinking buddy, here to help you make a few bucks\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/kcellqws61g71.jpg?width=1910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2d02093442caf6d87f1b758988574a8d824351f)\n\nNotice how in the morning shows he is in a suit and tie, and looks professional? But on his show in the evening - his personal image / brand changes. He is on the mad money set - it looks like a man cave, chaotic, a little messy. He rolls his sleeves up, like he has a had a hard day at work. Maybe you just got home from work and you have rolled up your sleeves like him. You see some sport memorabilia. You're a guy in your 50's like him, and you see yourself in him.\n\nHe always does the same routine at the start - I'm your friend, I am your buddy, I am here to make you a few bucks. Between his gentle reassuring words that he is your friend, his comedic routines with that stupid soundboard and the subtle imagery on the set design, and his wardrobe - it makes you feel like you can trust him, like he is an old drinking buddy. A friend.\n\nWe all know from The Coin Stock, The Chinese Taxi Stock and other disasters what this \"friend\" leads you to... but it doesn't matter. People will keep trusting him.\n\nPeople DO trust this guy, you just have to see some of his fans on twitter and what they say in response to his stock picks\n\nThis is also why I think he has started throwing around the words \"communists\" and \"Marxists\" when describing Reddit forums. What is a word that gets people fired up in America - the word communist. What if you could start building a frame work that people who are trading Gamestop are communists that hate rich people - its an easy story to sell, and you don't need proof. It's a very clickable headline - and it would be easy to get those in power such as congresspeople who clearly don't understand what is happening to go along with it. If he starts using those words more, and more, they catch on. Then you have a problem on your hands - we are all individual investors, how do you fight back?\n\n**STAY ON TASK - BUT CAST OUR NET FAR AND WIDE**\n\nI totally get the desire for this sub to stay on task with GME, and to only discuss things directly related to GME... but I wanted to share my thoughts on this mentality and why we should all have a little open minds when discussing information we find.\n\nAs we go down the rabbit hole, we find more and more things connected to this entire saga. Many of them aren't directly connected to GME, but these little puzzle pieces are leading us to the bigger picture - just how fucked the capital markets are. There is no price discovery, there is no free and fair market. It's rigged.\n\nWe are in a unique position to have thousands of people, many experts in their fields of finance, data analysis & historical analysis to be putting together this puzzle. The wider we cast out net, the more threads we find to unravel this mess. If we shut down ANY conversation that dares mentions political issues, housing issues, other stocks that share the same behaviours as GME - we are doing ourselves a disservice.\n\nObviously the integrity of this sub is paramount, and things like forum sliding and distraction should be at the forefront of everyones mind - but in saying that, a little leeway with thinking outside the box could go a long way with exposing even more evidence of corruption in the system, and how it relates to GME.\n\nWhen you are doing an investigation, you look at EVERYTHING. You discuss with your colleagues all sorts of theories, and past cases that share the same patterns. You bounce ideas of each other that may have nothing to do with the case on hand, but in doing so it really gets the investigative juices flowing in your brain to use your critical thinking.\n\nThis is just a personal thought, but I have seen a few times where decent conversations were deleted, or screamed into silence with chants of SHILL SHILL SHILL for bringing up a point that was a little outside the conventional thinking, but could be an interesting point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nI have been keeping a very close eye on financial networks, and taking notes daily on things I notice. I would like to continue posting here. I had some wonderful kind hearted messages and comments last time I posted, and its truly an honour to be on this journey with you all. I will keep making posts as I feel comfortable.\n\nTake Care everyone! Love to you all. xxx\n\n*And a little direct message to RC. If you're out there - and you want someone to come in house to help navigate and work logistics of the shit show that will be the international media camped in your parking lot when this rocket takes off - let me know. I'd quit my job and come to Grapevine in a second to help navigate what will probably the biggest news story on the planet.*",
