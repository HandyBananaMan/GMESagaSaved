Using technical tools I believed I can prove that shorts are in full desperation mode and are attacking the stock to an identical degree as when GME was below **10$**. There has been many good DDs and hypothesis on **how** they do it, now let me show you **why** they do it and how to spot it on the chart.   


*Feel free to add any meaningful info to the conversation and debate me on anything, my goal isn't to farm karma or spread FUD but to add wrinkles. ü¶ç*  


# .The trend is your friend

GME ascending triangle is the current trend we are in, shorts have been attacking us heavily using the share offering as their entry point and have been relentless ever since. Their goal is simple ; break the bullish trendline and keep APES below **350.**

*You can draw this triangle in many different ways, these lines are not the be-all and end-all.*

This isn't as accurate but gives a good idea on how the floor and the ceiling keep rising ever so slightly, closing their window of opportunity each time.

***Making higher lows and higher highs ever since Feb, we remain bullish on the most significant time frame***. 

# .RSI

One of my favorite tool for **T.A very good at** spotting manipulation and divergence. 

  
I believe this is where our journey began, **late summer of 2020**. At that time Hedgies were hammering **$GME** like there was no tommorow,   


As we all know, **APES** barely managed to saved the company and the rest is history.  


If you don't know how the RSI works you can just look at the red line, the last time GME was hammered this hard was back in June/July 2020 , right before things started to turn around.

This show us that *even though*  hey are using every trick in the book, hedgies are losing the battle and are having a tougher time bringing down the price. **APES are HODLING and stop losses are a thing of the past.**

Bullish divergence on the 4h timeframe, shown by the price action making lower lows and the RSI making higher lows .   


Basically confirming that shorts might **finaly** be running out of steam, which would make alot of sense after attacking so viciously for the last two months.

# .Volume

My hypothesis regarding low volume hasn't change very much since my last DD but I still wanted to compare it to it's previous low,  **July 2020** where things turned around for GME. This is not a coincidence people, they are using the same strategy right now that they were using when GME was about to get ~~executed.~~

Unfortunately for them, they can't keep shorting like this forever and as soon as the trend reverses significantly, normies will just jump in and FOMO like they always do, add on top of that shorts covering and the GAMMA ramp that long whales have been setting up for weeks and you get a  
   **HOLY MOLY** üöÄ

# .RO DMI

This is **R O C K Y O U T C R 0 P** DMI, a valuable tool for assessing price direction and strength. This is my favorite version of the Directional Movement Index. If you are not familiar with this indicator just follow along.   


For the longest time, maybe years ?? shorts were in control and as you know they took it the price to a low of 2$. This is where we were a year ago, **2$!!!!. Think about how mind boggling this must be for them, they were ready to give GME it's final blow and we swept the rug from under them. APES were in control but recently something changed, agressive over the top shorting is back on the menu.**   


Using the same illegal strategy they used a year ago to bring our beloved stock down to it's knees, they have managed to take back control of the stock as shown on the DMI.   


![üêª are going hard AF](https://preview.redd.it/c06j4nlokzf71.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca9c973299a8b8631e24b45657fc8b76c1939667)

  
They are using as much **ammo** right as they were on the previous horizontal red line around a year ago . This is confluent with what i've showed you previously on the **RSI.** Indicating that for the first time in a long time they feel like they must **act now** and show their hands.   


![Green crayon vs red crayon](https://preview.redd.it/9z3pyk28lzf71.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d706b91fa0bb4f557b9aa337aa9b6fa7e6bcb3)

  


The ADX (blue/pink line) represents the strenght of a particular move, everytime it changes color it means the trend is either heating up (turns blue) or cooling down (turns pink) . We just got a signal that things are about to go nuts for the **better or worst**. We will either get a massive dip or big rip **but no sideway trading**. **So buckle up !**   


***On the downside our next stop is 142$ and on the upside ( 155.50$ / 174$ )***

***''IF WE HIT 184$+ get ready for another rally***  
***If we drop to 136$ or below save up your ammo''***  


![Buckle the F up. ü¶ç](https://preview.redd.it/k0dxhfgclzf71.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad17d01969c5662d66f8e13805757798d03ef83e)

When you zoom out this much it's pretty easy to see why they were attacking so hard lately. Their window of efficacy is closing out on them and if they didn't act GME fast was gonna retest **350$**. **They just bought themselves some more time, ANOTHER DAY !**  


![üåàüêª](https://preview.redd.it/sgaudg4elzf71.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=547b581e37d8dade172cc33951a88f78f48b207d)

On this *Fibonacci* we can see that APES have been crushing it by **HODLING** , never allowing the stock to touch the **.382. Raising the floor with every sucessful test, my guess is that we will continue to do sountil they are completly fucked.**   


![No target, just up !](https://preview.redd.it/p8lz4qwelzf71.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecd4ee33e167f58bf5145e26cf3640689c0ea5c2)

Keeping us below **500$** is crucial for our ennemies, just from a technical standpoint the next price point would be **2400**$, even the biggest hedge fund couldn't diamond hand that. Pretty sure they would implode way before this price point anyway, iniating the squeeze.   


**GME never fails to rally once it hits 184$.**   


![Even without MOASS GME is destined to hit 2K$ ](https://preview.redd.it/tzyauilflzf71.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3978f2695e5012a0983bcc5bb781b87a5279847)

***TLDR ;***   
In conclusion I think it's pretty safe to assume that it's the end of the rope for them, maybe they have a little bit more as shown on the **DMI,** but who cares since the price is already wrong ? They are stuck between a rock and a hard place, drop it too low and it's fomo let it run and you're done. Just a matter of time before ü¶ç are back in control.   


***On the downside our next stop is 142$ and on the upside ( 155.50$ / 174$ )***  


***''IF WE HIT 187$+ get ready for another rally***  
***If we drop to 136$ or below save up your ammo''***  


Hope this confirms your bias and that everyone is having a great week-end, very much looking foward to next week.
