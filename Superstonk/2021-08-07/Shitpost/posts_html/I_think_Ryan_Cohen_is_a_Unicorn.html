<p>Apes,</p>
<p>I have been doing a lot of research and I discovered something that I think Ryan Cohen might be trying to keep hidden. Check this out. This is a  fresco by Domenichino, c. 1604â€“05. </p>

<p>Not seeing what I'm seeing? Don't worry I zoomed in on the unicorn's face for you here:</p>

<p>No fucking shit...</p>
<p>I checked Chewy.com as well and sure enough Unicorn food comes up as a catagory, notice anything?</p>

<p>Ever since I started taking a closer look at unicorn things I have noticed this guy everywhere basically. Check this out, I just googled "Unicorn" and this popped up:</p>

<p>I even found an anatomy of a unicorn diagram and again his face popped up:</p>

<p>I think the most incredible discovery I made though was this video:</p>

<p>All of this leads me to believe that this would be the accurate representation of when Ryan Cohen became Chairman of the Board for Gamestop:</p>
