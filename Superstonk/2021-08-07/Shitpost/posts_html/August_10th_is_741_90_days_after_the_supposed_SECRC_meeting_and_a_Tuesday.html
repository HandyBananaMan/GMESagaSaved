<p>August 10th is July 41st.  It is also 90 days after RC’s supposed meeting with the SEC (see his <a href="https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1392649234944507906?s=21">tweet from 5/12</a></p>
<p>GME also stated that the DTCC has 90 days to distribute their dividend or else they’ll take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1381829698263654401?s=21">This tweet from April </a> suggested something big was gonna happen on a Tuesday.  August 10th is a Tuesday. (The Culver City GameStop location is next door to a Tuesday Morning).</p>
<p>We know GameStop was rumored to need the London fork for Ethereum to be completed before launching their NFT.  That finished this past week.</p>
<p>Now RC tweets <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovdtis/gme_entering_next_week_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">referencing this post</a>  about something big happening next week.  </p>

<p>Edit: keep those titties jacked, but a reminder that I did mark this as a shit post as a lot of it is conjecture</p>
