August 10th is July 41st.  It is also 90 days after RC’s supposed meeting with the SEC (see his [tweet from 5/12](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1392649234944507906?s=21)

GME also stated that the DTCC has 90 days to distribute their dividend or else they’ll take matters into their own hands.

[This tweet from April ](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1381829698263654401?s=21) suggested something big was gonna happen on a Tuesday.  August 10th is a Tuesday. (The Culver City GameStop location is next door to a Tuesday Morning).

We know GameStop was rumored to need the London fork for Ethereum to be completed before launching their NFT.  That finished this past week.

Now RC tweets [referencing this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovdtis/gme_entering_next_week_like/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  about something big happening next week.
