Apes,

I have been doing a lot of research and I discovered something that I think Ryan Cohen might be trying to keep hidden. Check this out. This is a  fresco by Domenichino, c. 1604â€“05.

Not seeing what I'm seeing? Don't worry I zoomed in on the unicorn's face for you here:

No fucking shit...

I checked Chewy.com as well and sure enough Unicorn food comes up as a catagory, notice anything?

Ever since I started taking a closer look at unicorn things I have noticed this guy everywhere basically. Check this out, I just googled "Unicorn" and this popped up:

I even found an anatomy of a unicorn diagram and again his face popped up:

I think the most incredible discovery I made though was this video:

All of this leads me to believe that this would be the accurate representation of when Ryan Cohen became Chairman of the Board for Gamestop:
