# Title: The next time it runs to $350 and you are tempted to day trade because "the hedgies will just manipulate it back to $150", just remember the shorts WANT you to think this. Personally I will do the exact OPPOSITE of what the shorts want me to do because I remember DFV never sold.

Pretty much exactly what the title says. I know Apes are thinking "well they will just shorts it back to $150 once it reaches $350, and it will be the endgame all over again". 

Putting on my tin foul cap but I believe they are deliberately creating this repetitive cycle of running it to 350 and crashing it back to 150 to make Apes say "well fuck it if it's going to keep doing this, I might as well day trade".

DFV never sold, he could have had legendary realized gains but the fucking legend never day traded GME and QUADRUPLED down, fucking legend.

Me personally, I will not let shorts tempt me to get off the rocket to make puny gains just to get left behind once the rocket takes off.

Not financial advise, just sharing my thoughts and my personal strategy.

Edit:

Wow lots of people calling me a shill, saying FUD, telling me to fuck off so here's an update to those saying that "Noone thinks like that you are a shill implanting FUD".

If I'm being honest, I've been poor my whole life so when I see a trend showing I could have made thousands of dollars by day trading it looks tempting because the poor side of me is telling me "oh look at all the money you could have made".

But I'm saying despite feeling like that, I've come to realize how stupid it would be to miss the rocket launch into retirement by pinching profits.

I have had Apes reach out to me and tell me they felt the same way and that the post helped them also realize how dumb it would be.

Just being honest about how I feel and trying to help other Apes realize the same.

Is that fair? Or should I still fuck off?
