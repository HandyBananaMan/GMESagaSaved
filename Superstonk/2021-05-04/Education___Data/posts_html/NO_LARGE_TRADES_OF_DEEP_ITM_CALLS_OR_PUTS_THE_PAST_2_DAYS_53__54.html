<p>What up Apes,</p>
<p>u/Dan_Bren here wanted to apologize for the lack of posts been super busy but wanted to get the data out for everyone who's been asking. We didn't see any large block trades of DEEP ITM calls or puts the past 2 days. I will continue to monitor how the rest of the week plays out (data below)</p>
