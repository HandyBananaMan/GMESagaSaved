So let's remember what u/Bye_Triangle said:\n\n**CONTACT YOUR BROKER, THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO WILL BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU BASED ON YOUR EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!**\n\nIt is extremely important that you aren't just taking advice on this from the subreddit, every broker has slightly different ways of doing things, and in this subreddit there are people from all over the world, using brokers with all sorts of different rules under all sorts of different legal systems. So I reiterate:\n\n**CONTACT YOUR BROKER**\n\nSo, with that out of the way, we thought it may be important to touch on the process of voting again, this vote is incredibly important and could determine the future of GameStop as a company... Squeeze or no, it should be regarded as a priority for you to take the time to make your voice heard. You have invested time and money into this company and it would be a waste to not vote if you can.\n\n**Steps to Voting:**\n\n1. HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER\n\nObtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.\n\n2. INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).\n\nDo not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.\n\n3. UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.\n\nTake a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.\n\n4. SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.\n\n5. SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.\n\nGamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible. Many speculate that there may be some short-seller-related fuckery with the votes given how badly they are likely hurting right now. With the untold number of borrowed shares and phantom shares flying around it certainly seems possible we may see a substantial number of over-votes (votes that exceed the total number of existing shares). It is unclear exactly how this will be handled if it does come to fruition, so it is best you vote the moment you are able.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\ud83d\udc08 **BUT PINK, WHAT IF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY CONTROL NUMBER YET?! \ud83e\udda7**\n\n**Well, did you...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Check your broker inbox for proxy info\u2714\n* Check your email\u2714\n* Send a message via your broker help/chat interface\u2714\n* Call your broker and request your control number\u2714\n* Look around the comments and other posts to see if any resources have been shared that might help you in your search\u2714\n* Check your broker's website for an FAQ- Many have a landing page with GME specific proxy info\u2714\n\nKeep in mind some brokers just haven't issued them yet. And some are anticipating up to 2 weeks longer wait before you can vote. Geez, it seems almost like they're having trouble finding the shares to vote or something. \ud83e\udd14\n\nI can confirm that Robinhood and TDA are issuing control numbers that come up invalid when you enter them in the official Gamestop proxy website. I don't know what that means. I am still investigating why brokers seems to have their own landing page for proxy voting. Idk am not computer nerd, am just pink cat \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n[**Edit: More info from Euroapes trying to vote!!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwpqdf/europoors_what_needs_to_be_done_to_be_able_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[**And a report from Degiro**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DEGIRO/comments/n4kn6t/degiro_refuses_to_give_out_control_numbers_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nAs with everything, the first step towards creating real change is to exercise your right to vote \ud83d\udcaa\n\n[I voted!](https://preview.redd.it/xowmj5skc1x61.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46c485c050a3f81fd2ee212844d51c68abad7766)\n\n# \ud83d\udce3\ud83d\udce3Speaking of the importance of Proxy voting...\ud83d\udce3\ud83d\udce3\n\n**Do you apes wish you knew why we keep talking about voting?!**\n\n**Do you wish you could ask someone what proxy voting is?!**\n\n**DO YOU WISH SOMEONE WOULD JUST COME AND EXPLAIN WHAT THE HELL ALL THIS MEANS?!** >!Yes please dear God!<\n\nYou really loved having Queen Kong, Dr. T on our Superstonk Live YouTube.
