Plenty of other posts out there with the screenshot of the terms and agreement form that states RH can use all shares of any security on margin whether you have margin turned on or not.\n\nWhen your assets transfer to another broker, they will show up as if they are on Margin. No worries though if you don\u2019t have margin turned on your account in your new broker because they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to act as if those shares are actually on margin. Not financial advice.\n\nBuy. Hodl. Vote. GTFO of RH\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not a financial advisor. Not financial advice. I just don\u2019t like supporting businesses that don\u2019t feel bad about not having any decency towards anyone or anything but their own bank statement.",
