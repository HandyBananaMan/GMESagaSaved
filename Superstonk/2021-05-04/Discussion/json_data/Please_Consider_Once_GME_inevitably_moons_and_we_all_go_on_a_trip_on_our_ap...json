Current practices of the world\u2019s society is literally killing oceanic life and practically speaking, our greatest source of breathable oxygen on Planet Earth. \n\nTherefore after GME inevitably moons (\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80) and once we\u2019re all dancing on Pluto with Papa Cohen DJ\u2019ing and DFV serving as hype man, one of my many philanthropic endeavors will be contributing to and physically assisting as best I can to progress the long journey of undoing/subverting the impact mankind has had and the damage we\u2019ve caused. \n\n*TLDR:*\nGME will \ud83d\ude80\n\ud83e\udd8d will get \ud83c\udf57\n\ud83e\udd8d should help \ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udc2c\ud83d\udc22\n\nBUY.
