<p>Before I watched Seaspiricy on Netflix and performed my own DD on the current state of the oceanic ecosystem, I had zero knowledge of how dire the situation has become.  Current practices of the world’s society is literally killing oceanic life and practically speaking, our greatest source of breathable oxygen on Planet Earth. </p>
<p>Therefore after GME inevitably moons (🚀🚀) and once we’re all dancing on Pluto with Papa Cohen DJ’ing and DFV serving as hype man, one of my many philanthropic endeavors will be contributing to and physically assisting as best I can to progress the long journey of undoing/subverting the impact mankind has had and the damage we’ve caused. </p>
<p><em>TLDR:</em>
GME will 🚀
🦍 will get 🍗
🦍 should help 🌎🐋🐬🐢</p>
<p>BUY. HODL. EZ.</p>
