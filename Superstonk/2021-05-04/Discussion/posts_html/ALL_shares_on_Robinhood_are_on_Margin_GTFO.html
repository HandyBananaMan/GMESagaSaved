<p>Why would you want to know that your x, xx, xxx, xxxx, xxxxx+ shares are being used as if they are on margin? Plenty of other posts out there with the screenshot of the terms and agreement form that states RH can use all shares of any security on margin whether you have margin turned on or not.</p>
<p>When your assets transfer to another broker, they will show up as if they are on Margin. No worries though if you don’t have margin turned on your account in your new broker because they wouldn’t be allowed to act as if those shares are actually on margin. Not financial advice.</p>
<p>Buy. Hodl. Vote. GTFO of RH</p>
<p>Edit: I’m not a financial advisor. Not financial advice. I just don’t like supporting businesses that don’t feel bad about not having any decency towards anyone or anything but their own bank statement.</p>
