    "selftext": "The entire market is bloody red and today is the day 801 is suppose to be passed. If you don't know what it is, please read about it! In short, hedgies need to put up like 20x the collateral to short or in other words they are fucked! Dogecoin is soaring and who owns a lot of dogecoin? That's right, fucking robinthehood! Guess what? Rh is basically citadel bitch, so basically citadel is pumping up doge to raise money. Guess what, rh restricts selling so citadel can make money and retails gets fucked over again. Get out of rh already! Check the rest of cryptos, they are all down and Elon didn't tweet anything about dogecoin. Hm interesting, maybe shitadel needs money to not be margin called\n\nApparently shares are hard to fill overseas! Liquidity is drying up. Why can't you buy shares? Maybe there aren't any real shares floating around and you can't buy fake shares overseas! Here is a picture of no volume from today!https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4t1mb/we_just_had_two_1_min_candles_with_0_volume_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nAlso shitadel registering something in Cayman Islands. There are no coincidences, shits going down.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4sbhz/omg_wtf_did_shitadel_register_something_in_the/\n\nAlso technical analysis is pointing to a breakdown at the apex soon and many DD out there talking about the Elliot wave and how we are primed to pop. Also the TTM squeeze is showing signs of a pop! Not to mention the Macd and the volume drying up, that's a good sign for big volume to come in and you know what happens afterwards \ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso Reddit been down for me for an hour or so! Please let me know if you apes are experiencing it as well. Remember when they took down wsb and gme sub? Yeah it is coming together. Also a lot of apes are having technical difficulties from Reddit. Hm, coincidence again?\n\nAlso gme is hard to borrow on TDA\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n4qmg5/ooooopppss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAnyways no dates, my point is that dogecoin going up and the market going down today isn't a coincidence. Some shit is brewing and my tits are jacked. Always jacked! \n\nDiamond hand apes, we are in the endgame\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\u270b\u270b\u270b\n\nIf I miss something or I am wrong on some points, please let me know!!!\n\nBTW gme is moving up after hours? Hmmmm interesting\n\nIMPORTANT INFO, 801 is ready!!\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n51u5d/sec_has_no_objections_to_nscc801/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",
