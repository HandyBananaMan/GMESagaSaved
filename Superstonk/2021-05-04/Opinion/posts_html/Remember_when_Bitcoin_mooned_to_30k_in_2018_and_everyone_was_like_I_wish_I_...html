<p>Back in 2018, Bitcoin gained a massive spike in value. Many people were FOMOing in at very high prices, even taking out loans to buy more Bitcoin (never do this; never EVER do this, not even for a thing as sure as GME; never ever in your life spend more money on investments than you have) and even more people had the thought: "I wish I had bought into this earlier, then I would be rich now!"</p>
<p>It will be exactly the same during the GME squeeze. Some people will FOMO in when it's already too late. Everyone else who hears about it on the news will think: "I wish I had bought some shares earlier, I could have been rich! But now it's too late!"</p>
<p>We're the people who bought in before it was too late. We can all look back afterwards and say: I was a part of it! You won't be among those who regret not seizing the opportunity when they had it. No matter how much you are hodling, be it X, XX, XXX, XXXX, or even XXXXX, you're part of it. We're all going to the moon together and it will be beautiful.</p>
