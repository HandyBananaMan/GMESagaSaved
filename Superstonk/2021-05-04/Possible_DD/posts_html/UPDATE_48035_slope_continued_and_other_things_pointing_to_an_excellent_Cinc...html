<p>For those of you who haven't read my possible DD last week, here is the link:</p>

<p>It basically examines the trend line created from the peaks on January 28th and March 10th. Friday's closing price of $173.59 remained just $1.99 below the descending slope of $4.8035. The theories within that post have continued this week with the falling price. Here is an update to the table within my last DD with this weeks prices:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/gw8f3pzx37x61.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1753bfb81f0c42c697a534f57c115c9509b38563</p>
<p>The daily peaks for last Friday and this Monday were $8.22 and $6.71 higher than their prices along the slope, respectively. Both of these peaks occurred at the very beginning of the day and the prices fell thereafter. After the big drop on Monday, they bought a little more time. <strong>HOWEVER,</strong> the after hours price on Tuesday closed at $161.89 (per Yahoo Finance), which is $0.72 <strong>HIGHER</strong> than the price on the slope for tomorrow. Since the March 10th peak, we have yet to close above the slope. In fact, this slope was created using those two peaks to begin with soooo, GME has actually <strong>NEVER</strong> closed above the slope. Given the big triangle, bull pennant, bull flag, whatever the fuck you wanna call it, it appears inevitable for it to come to a head this week. They would have to continue to really drop the price to avoid this. In sum, if GME has any sort of green day tomorrow on <strong>Cinco de Buyo</strong> or if the price falls no more than $0.72 from today's closing after hours price, GME would close above the slope for the first time and it would also appear that the bull pennant has finally come to a close.</p>
<p>On top of this, y'all know what else is going on right now!?</p>
<ul>
<li>The DDs talking about the T+13 cycle for options that have led to big run-ups on February 24th and March 10th. Guess when T+13 is for the April 16th options?  <strong>Cinco de Buyo</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Ever since SR-NSCC-2021-801 came out, it has appeared that MOASS would not happen until it could be implemented. Well, it was approved without objection <strong>today</strong> and now they just need 002 in place to cover dey bitch asses, which will happen by the time the MOASS appears to start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, Superstonk hit 250,000 today and WSB also hit 10,000,000 today. Bias confirmed.</p>

</ul>
<p>This is all speculation apes, <strong>NO DATES</strong> and <strong>NOT</strong> financial advice. It just feels like the stars are aligning.</p>
