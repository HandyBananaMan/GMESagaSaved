This just confirms my thoughts.\nA ton of silent apes are among us. This army is terrifying in a positive way.\nI would really shit my pants if I had to fight this new first-time-in-history-smooth-brain-enemy.\n\nEdit 3: Just finished reading and upvoting all these nice comments. A lot of people did their first comment. I am honored.\nAlso some mentioned they have friends /family who own GME shares and don't use reddit.\nI also have a few friends with GME positions, also non-reddit user.\nGME is in nearly every EU county the most traded stock (German \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea ape here). \nWhen I think about it, and I am here since January, I might have underestimated the amount of apes worldwide \ud83d\ude33",
