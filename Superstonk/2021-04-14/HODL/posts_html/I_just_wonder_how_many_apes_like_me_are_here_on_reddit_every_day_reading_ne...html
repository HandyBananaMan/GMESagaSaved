<p>Damn I just love to be part of this saga. 🦍🦍🦍💎🚀🌌</p>
<p>Edit 1: I just upvoted every single comment because there was not a SINGLE negative one so far.
Damn this community has become awesome ❤️</p>
<p>Edit 2: Wow nearly 9k likes and a lot of awards 🥰 I really appreciate it guys thank you. This just confirms my thoughts.
A ton of silent apes are among us. This army is terrifying in a positive way.
I would really shit my pants if I had to fight this new first-time-in-history-smooth-brain-enemy.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Just finished reading and upvoting all these nice comments. A lot of people did their first comment. I am honored.
Also some mentioned they have friends /family who own GME shares and don't use reddit.
I also have a few friends with GME positions, also non-reddit user.
GME is in nearly every EU county the most traded stock (German 🇩🇪 ape here). 
When I think about it, and I am here since January, I might have underestimated the amount of apes worldwide 😳</p>
