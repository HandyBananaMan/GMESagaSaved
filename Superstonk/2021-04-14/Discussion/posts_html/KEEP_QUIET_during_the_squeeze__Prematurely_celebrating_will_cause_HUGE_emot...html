<p>Credit to u/JerryTheGiraffe820 for the idea regarding FUD caused by family and friends. Very good topic of discussion</p>
<p>Some of us are going to become incredibly rich VERY early on during the squeeze, and I cant stress enough how important it is to keep this to yourself until you’ve finally decided to sell. Let me make this clear, NOBODY AROUND YOU UNDERSTANDS HOW BIG THIS ACTUALLY IS. PERIOD. </p>
<p>Telling your friends/family that you are now worth 25k, 100k, 500k or a million, 1 day into the squeeze will do nothing but cause trouble. Yes, you’re going to be excited. Yes, you’re going to want to immediately tell your parents that their money troubles are now gone. But trust me, this will cause HUGE amounts of pressure at any sign of trouble along the ride to the moon. Any sort of dip will cause you to panic, knowing the excitement you gave off to your friends and family is now at risk of being overhyped and flat out wrong, making you look reckless/idiotic for selling at any less than what you originally told them.</p>
<p>TLDR: TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT YOUR GAINS PREMATURELY WILL INTRODUCE EMOTIONS INTO DECISION MAKING. KEEP CALM, AND SHUT TF UP</p>
