DFV's [tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1382405013989961736) today is a scene from Lost, the TV series

They couldn't open [the hatch](https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hatch#Entry) except by blowing it open using dynamite.

Where was this dynamite found? On a trading ship called the [Black Rock](https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Rock).

Are we about to blow open the hatch?!
