Another interesting thing to note is that these were very frequently traded in pairs previously and so it had been theorized that these were being bought and sold. The ones bought today were not in pairs and so we can narrow it down to three potential options(HA). If they were bought and sold in the same second the size of the trades could be halved and it could essential be its own \"pair.\" This also only captures the data for large trades and so if they were sold in smaller bunches I wouldn't be able to see it. Lastly they could still be holding them.\n\nWe shall see if there is more of this tomorrow. As always I will keep you posted.\n\nA far-fetched theory (right?) : I always kind of assumed these calls were being bought but the data set I have doesn't really indicate buy or sell. This is why I have to make some assumptions when it comes to thinking they are often traded in pairs. What if the whole time they were selling them and collecting the premiums. this would go against some of the FTD resetting theories so this is of course just an idea I had but it just caught me off guard as I had never considered it.",
