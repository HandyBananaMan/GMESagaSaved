    "selftext": "It's 1pm and the volume is less than 3 million for the whole day. There are barely any shares being traded right now and GME looks like a penny stock with 1 minute candles. Banks are suddenly raising billions of dollars they may need for collateral on huge upcoming margin calls. GME is trading more sideways than I've ever seen it trade before and it's oddly quiet. \n\nI smell something brewing apes, let's just be patient...\n\nHODL\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nEdit: We ended the day with UNDER 4 MILLION VOLUME. This is the lowest of the entire 2021 year!",
