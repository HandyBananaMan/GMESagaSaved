<p>Hey guys I just randomly decided to do this as u/WardenElite is taking a break, we'll see how it goes let me know if you like it and I can continue doing this while he is on hiatus.</p>
<p><strong>I will delete previous images as the day progresses due to 20 image cap</strong></p>

<p>Closed at 158.34 down 0.12% on the day. Narrating sideways chop on no volume has not been easy. Thank you guys all for tuning in I hope I didn't disappoint I had some big shoes to fill here today. Also, a huge thanks for the awards and positivity. A lot of people have been asking about streaming I am considering it here is my YouTube link for now  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmgi8psSbIWiSR2tefHbug">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYmgi8psSbIWiSR2tefHbug</a> if you want. I will probably do this for a couple more days just to get a feel for it before I go live simultaneously. I think we may see a gap up in pre-market.</p>
<p>See you all tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>3:55</strong> Edit 52</p>
<p>Look like we are gonna be closing at 158</p>
<p><strong>3:51</strong> Edit 51</p>
<p>So Close</p>

<p><strong>3:36</strong> Edit 50</p>
<p>GME and SPY running hot together interesting</p>
<p><strong>3:22</strong> Edit 49</p>
<p>Lost the battle for VWAP to the bears buy and sell volume are still crazy low let's see if we consolidate and push again</p>

<p><strong>3:14</strong> Edit 48</p>
<p>Broke out of the bear flag but volume is still awful this is probably our shot at ending up for the day</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>3:03</strong> Edit 47</p>
<p>So unless we get some volume it looks like we will end the day somewhere in the 155-157 range</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>2:56</strong> Edit 46</p>
<p>Volume coming in looks like we are gonna break that flag to the upside</p>
<p><strong>2:45</strong> Edit 45</p>
<p>Still trending downwards bear flags can keep traveling down till we settle at resistance. We still have no volume but power hour is coming up a decent push could set us up for a nice day tomorrow</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Looking for the bounce at 156.50</p>
<p><strong>2:25</strong> Edit 43</p>
<p>Trending downwards now nice bear flag forming, these tend to break up</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>2:20</strong> Edit 42</p>
<p>Those rarely play out on the 1-minute , fortunately it looks like nobody is taking less than 157 for their shares, it also appears nobody want to buy GME for more than 157, at least right now</p>
<p><strong>2:05</strong> Edit 41</p>
<p>This is the cup let's see that handle</p>

<p><strong>1:52</strong> Edit 39</p>
<p>How much can I talk about a stock that has 7 dollars of total range in a day?</p>
<p>Answer: A lot, I like this stock.</p>
<p><strong>1:41</strong> Edit 38</p>
<p>If this uptrend breaks expect them to push down pretty hard</p>
<p><strong>1:37</strong> Edit 37</p>
<p>You can see the bears really don't want us to break that resistance every time we move upward they are using more and more volume to keep the price down. It's ok they only have so much ammo.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/xl4kzk48cku61.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e88b575c21944b10202494406ae518cf5fdf8f5</p>
<p><strong>1:31</strong> Edit 36</p>
<p>Hopefully the breakout on this wedge puts the price above VWAP before power hour I know a lot of people with options expiring tomorrow wouldn't mind seeing a nice upswing today.</p>
<p><strong>1:20</strong> Edit 35</p>
<p>This could be the completion of that Head and Shoulders line at the bottom is resistance. Nobody is buying but apes sure as hell aren't selling</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>1:16 Edit 34</p>
<p>Breaking below on a little volume so we could see a dip to 156 or 152</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>1:00</strong> Edit 33</p>
<p>We need a bit of volume on this bounce to crossover otherwise this is the new wedge I'm looking at</p>

<p><strong>12:51</strong> Edit 32</p>
<p>Possibly another dip buy, looks like a head and shoulders formed here</p>

<p><strong>12:33</strong> Edit 30</p>
<p>Even though the volume is low being above VWAP helps because the algorithmic /high frequency traders are more bullish above VWAP than below</p>
<p><strong>12:30</strong> Edit 29</p>
<p>Super technical breakdown of VWAP broke out the crayon for this</p>

<p><strong>12:26</strong> Edit 28</p>
<p>If VWAP turns from resistance to support that positions GME well for a power hour test of the 175 resistance</p>
<p><strong>12:21</strong> Edit 27</p>
<p>This midday volume uptick is good news, testing VWAP now</p>

<p><strong>12:07</strong> Edit 25</p>
<p>A little better volume on these last 2 candles triangle break out occurred earlier than I expected</p>
<p><strong>12:05</strong> Edit 24</p>
<p>Updated triangle with possible breakout point</p>
<p><strong>12:00</strong> Edit 23</p>
<p>The only real sell wall is at 162 and it is minimal any amount of decent upward volume should push us through that resistance at VWAP. That little short attack has pushed us under that previous resistance I posted earlier so I will re-draw momentarily</p>
<p><strong>11:55</strong> Edit 22</p>
<p>For those talking about negative beta it really doesn't effect anything the S&amp;P is mooning right now and we are pretty stagnant</p>
<p><strong>11:46</strong> Edit 21</p>
<p>Small volume spike on that dip I figure they want us trading in that lower channel</p>
<p><strong>11:38</strong> Edit 20</p>
<p>We will probably see a nice dip buy opportunity coming up if you looking for a coupon</p>
<p><strong>11:26</strong> Edit 19</p>
<p>Looks like we need to consolidate more might break out around the x</p>
<p><strong>11:24</strong> Edit 18</p>
<p>Testing VWAP again</p>
<p><strong>11:20</strong> Edit 17</p>
<p>This stock wants to move up so badly even with no volume look at it fighting the good fight</p>
<p><strong>11:12</strong> Edit 16</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><strong>11:05</strong> Edit 15</p>
<p>I wouldn't say broke out, maybe rolled of the top, either way it will be hard to break that VWAP resistance without some volume</p>
<p><strong>11:00</strong> Edit 14</p>
<p>That spike earlier moved us $5 on 438,389 volume we probably would be trading in that lower channel without it. Also I am using Heikin Ashi Candlesticks I prefer them for day trading.</p>

<p>Look at me reading the tea leaves</p>
<p><strong>10:36</strong> Edit 10</p>
<p>It would be nice to cross vwap and trade in the upper channel</p>
<p>Nice little intraday wedge on the 1min chart for you guys! Slightly downward could break up</p>

<p>Market is recovering from that brief correction yesterday, it's strength should help us a bit</p>

<p>Never used this before but it looks like some way OTM calls came in and a few deep ITM puts</p>
<p>Lottery tickets and hedges? I really don't wanna pay for premium lol.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Iborrow shows there were 40k at open 5k were used at opening bell to suppress spikes?</p>
<p>The buy-in we saw might be these 315,000 shares returned borrow rate is still up at 1.1%</p>
<p><strong>9:51</strong> Edit 3</p>
<p>I don't have options sonar so my analysis of the options chain may be a little weaker for the AM I'll sign up now, still very low volume. RSI got blown out a bit on the one minute probably settle between 158.5 and 162.5 for the time being</p>
<p><strong>9:50</strong> Edit 2</p>
<p>IV is low, fire sale!</p>
<p><strong>9:43</strong> Edit 1</p>
<p>We are quickly approaching that Pokeball day warden was speaking of but here comes that 9:50 dip on no volume. Probably more sideways chop till volume picks up</p>
