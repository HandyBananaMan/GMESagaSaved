<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><strong>A man once told his young wife that he could never eat fish.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the years she offered again and again, as this was old times and fish was probably readily available.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Through the years he swore he could not eat fish.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One day she cooked him a big hunk of probably some other animal roast and tucked fish inside to prove he'd like it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When she served dinner he took a bite and began to gasp, choking on air until he turned into a fish before his poor wife's horrified eyes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See, he couldn't eat fish cause he'd been one all along.</strong></p>
<p>I really like that fable, can't really do it justice.</p>

<p>plus seems people are really ramping up the awesome dd, which the lack thereof is what made me start poking around in hopes i can contribute</p>
<p>but mostly i wanted to give links so someones will read along with me and become familiar with these names</p>
