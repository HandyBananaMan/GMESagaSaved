**TL;DR**

**A man once told his young wife that he could never eat fish.**

**Over the years she offered again and again, as this was old times and fish was probably readily available.**

**Through the years he swore he could not eat fish.**

**One day she cooked him a big hunk of probably some other animal roast and tucked fish inside to prove he'd like it.**

**When she served dinner he took a bite and began to gasp, choking on air until he turned into a fish before his poor wife's horrified eyes.**

**See, he couldn't eat fish cause he'd been one all along.**

I really like that fable, can't really do it justice.

Okay gonna stop for the evening guys. I woke up all drenched in gross night sweats and then slept the whole day and i still haven't done the dishes or spent time with anyone and my teenage kiddo just ASKED to spend time with me so

plus seems people are really ramping up the awesome dd, which the lack thereof is what made me start poking around in hopes i can contribute

but mostly i wanted to give links so someones will read along with me and become familiar with these names

I'll still post up my endowment Master Fund one later cause it's pretty much done but looks like people are in a fact-finding frenzy themselves, which warms my heart and apparently heats my whole body all night

hearts hearts
