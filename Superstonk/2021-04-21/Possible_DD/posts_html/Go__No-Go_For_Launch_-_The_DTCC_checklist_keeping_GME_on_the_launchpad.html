<h4><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhh0f1/update_go_nogo_for_launch_the_checklist_keeping/">New Post - Updated and reposted version as of 2021-05-20</a> &lt;-- all updates will be made there.</h4>
<p><strong>TL;DR: DTCC &amp; Wall St want key things in place before GME unwinds:</strong></p>
<h2>1 - Rules of Engagement</h2>
<h2>2 - Funding</h2>
<h2>3 - Cover Story for Timing</h2>
<h2>4 - Avoiding Perception of Responsibility</h2>
<p><strong>Official notice that this is not financial advice, etc etc. I have no idea if any of this is indeed why these things are happening, or if they are even what I think they are. I bought a handful of shares before DFV's Congressional hearing because something seemed fucky, and that was my first stock purchase EVER. If you make financial decisions off of this speculation, you probably do eat crayons like me. I am literally just some Ape on the internet mashing buttons and you're gonna have to explain to your wife's boyfriend why you took this as advice and then spent your whole allowance already this week.</strong></p>
<p>So this <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu9xed/why_were_still_trading_sideways_and_why_we_havent/">last post</a> from u/c-digs is about as close as anyone has come to my personal theory that there is a literal checklist somewhere that is getting marked off before this is allowed to unravel. The DTCC and Wall St (and probably the SEC) definitely do not want this spring to unwind before they are ready, and certainly not in a way in which they don't feel they are in control. These players are Big Corporate dicks with Big Corporate mindsets, and its my bet that they don't do anything without a plan that at least addresses all eventualities.</p>
<p>However, as it is now probably alarmingly clear to them this isn't just gonna go away on its own (cue Apes waving from the windows of the rocket sitting on the launchpad), the DTCC and pals are now scrambling to get the last things in place before somebody trips over the cord to the shredder at 3am and lands on the launch button.</p>
<p>I think the list goes something like this, but am intending this to be <strong>a crowdsourced document</strong> because there is no way I can keep this all straight on my own, and the GME Investor community has done so so much great DD already. There is definitely more to add in terms of DTCC / OCC / NSCC / SEC rules, and please comment with additional items &amp; sources and I'll try to keep up with editing them into the list. Compiling it here can probably help determine just how close GME probably is to liftoff. It feels like we aren't that far from it now.</p>
<h2>1 - Rules of Engagement</h2>
<p><strong>Opinon - Status: No-Go for Launch</strong><br />
DTCC would benefit most if new rules about payments in a member default situation are in effect prior to launch.</p>
<p>✅ = in effect now<br />
❌ = pending review / revision</p>
<h3>To Cover DTCC's own ass</h3>
<ul>

<em>The "We'll liquidate your asse(t)s if you default, then make your pals chip in, before we pay a dime ourselves" Rule.</em><br />
Also stipulates what the DTCC is willing to cover when reconciling, as in only shares on the books, and why you (yes you Ape) should have a cash account and not a margin account.<br />

<p><strong>SR-DTC-2021-006: Remove the Security Holder Tracking Service</strong> <br />
<em>The "We're dropping the old way of tracking shares, cause it didn't work well, and DTC-2021-005 will do it better" Rule.</em><br />
It was speculated in another post that the old system of tracking needed to be removed so there was no conflict in implementing DTC-2021-005 (I can't find that post here on reddit anymore, src needed!). It's likely that this could pave the way for 005 to be implemented.

<p><strong>SR-DTC-2021-007: Update the DTC Corporate Actions Distributions Service Guide</strong><br />
<em>The "Stop bickering back and forth over the manual adjustments to your peer to peer trade records via the dumb APO method, and just use the GD computer validated Claim Connect system, please" Rule.</em><br />
Way to make a super vague title DTC... This is mostly about borrowed shares and updating who pays how much when circumstances - like rates - change. The old system (APO) needed both parties to just agree on the adjustments and one side could only submit an adjustment at a time, so it was rarely agreed upon in one pass and the bad guys could likely stall with many back and forths. To me this reads as a please use this better thing now, because APO will go away on July 9th 2021 so you'll have to use Claim Connect by then anyways. Since the lender is likely incentivized to use the new system, it may get adopted in higher numbers sooner.<br />

<em>"When a company needs to quickly pay off their debts as in the case of a margin call, it can be challenging for them to gather all the money from their various investments.

"Starting on May 3, 2021, the fixed time of 1:00PM will be eliminated and the MBSD Intraday Mark-to-Market Charge will return to an hourly assessment." This combined with other things will tighten the screws.<br />

<h2>2 - Funding</h2>
<p><strong>Opinion - Status: Go for Launch</strong><br />
SR-DTC-2021-004 was likely the big one here, but SR-OCC-2021-004 would be very handy in the aftermath so it's maybe 70/30 in my eyes.</p>

<h2>3 - Cover for Timing of Launch</h2>
<p><strong>Opinion - Status: No-Go for Launch</strong><br />
This will likely be the very last one, and we'll only know what they will use as an excuse once it's started. I think all the other pieces would need to be in place for them to feel most confident to light the fuse. This will be more oportunistic in nature, I think.</p>
<p>Ideally a plausible Corporate or Market Event that the stock price “should” respond to in order to initiate without the timing looking SUS AF and destabilizing broader market due to fear systemic problems.</p>

<h2>4 - Fallguy, and the Lack of Prevention</h2>
<p><strong>Opinion - Status: Go for Launch</strong><br />
While they will likely have a fallguy decided upon prior to launch, I don't see it as a necessity that would delay it, certainly not like the Rules of Engagement or Funding would. I also think that nothing would keep them from changing the story if something else influences the narrative in an acceptable way shortly after liftoff.</p>
