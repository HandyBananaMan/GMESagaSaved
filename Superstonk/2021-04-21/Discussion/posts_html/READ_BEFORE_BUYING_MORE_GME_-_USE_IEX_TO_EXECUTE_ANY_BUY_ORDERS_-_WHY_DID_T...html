<p>IEX was brought up on several posts last week or the week before but the topic faded very fast.  If this helps push price up even a tiny bit this topic needs to be resurrected because it might be one of the only ways to counteract buys being diverted into dark pools.</p>
<p>The IEX exchange was setup to protect retail investors and was fought heavily by hedge funds when it was established (I wonder why).  You may need to go into your account settings to be able to select IEX vs the default which would be called something like "smart exchange" AKA KG keeps your buy from helping to push the price up.</p>

<p>Below is an example from TDA of what you want selected and how to set it up explained in another post:</p>

<p>Expanding on Fidelity with a post made by Fidelity:</p>
<p>Hi u/AllCredits, directed trading is available using our Active Trader Pro (ATP) software (which is free to use for all clients of Fidelity).

The directed trading feature can be accessed in ATP by going to the menu for ‚ÄúTrade &amp; Orders‚Äù then selecting ‚ÄúDirected Trade &amp; Extended Hours.‚Äù  Please visit Fidelity.com to learn more about how Fidelity manages order flow and trade execution quality to save you money.</p>

<p>Edit 5: Wealth Simple Trading Broker üá®üá¶: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms8q2w/apes_using_wealth_simple_trading_broker_here_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf </p>

<p>Edit 6: I‚Äôve seen posts about apes attempting to route via IEX but the trade ends up running through citadel.  I share the opinion this Is because Citadel has the only GME liquidity left in the market with their counterfeit shares so when your broker tries to execute IEX if it cant it defaults to most favorable option.  By routing via IEX even if it does go Citadels way for the liquidity reason it should still help by forcing the buys to go through something other than dark pools. This means it‚Äôs at least being counted towards volume and buy pressure. I need someone smarter to validate this thinking.  </p>

<p>Edit 10: sounds like interactive brokers allows you to select routing to IEX. I am still digging of Schwab - trying to see if their TDA connection opens it up </p>

<p>This is not financial advice.  Do your homework on the exchange you trade through.  This is just one apes opinion. I am not a financial advisor.</p>
