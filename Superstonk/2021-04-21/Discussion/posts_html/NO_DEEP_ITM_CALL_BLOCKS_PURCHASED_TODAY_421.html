<p>What up Apes,</p>
<p>u/Dan_Bren with a quick update on today's DEEP ITM calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/0rve0srysmu61.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e12f5155f7ecc8bc1d7e2963ba12eef3863c2e63">GME Biggest Options Trades 4\/21\/2021</a></p>
<p>There weren't any. (Large purchases)</p>
<p>Nothing really new on this front so I wanted to take this time explain a bit more into how these DEEP ITM calls were being used to "hide" FTD's(Failed-to deliver).</p>
<p>I personally was not the best when it came to explaining this but an ape with more wrinkles than I summed it up beautifully. BIG shoutout u/ujar89 for this one:</p>
<p>Here is the process they use to reset/hide FTDs. Please keep in mind Citadel is also a market maker. (Yes I know, conflict of interest). 'A' can be Citadel and 'B' can be Melvin in this example.</p>
<ol>
<li>A (the market maker) gives B X amount of synthetic shares (remember only market makers have this power). B gives A collateral so A doesn't get screwed (the collateral is basically the premium A pays to purchase the contracts from B).</li>
<li>B uses those synthetic shares to close out existing FTD positions.</li>
<li>B writes deep ITM calls (so A knows it's B).</li>
<li>A buys the calls and exercises them receiving X shares back as IOUs.</li>
<li>Now B has effectively closed out old FTDs while creating fresh new IOUs that will become FTDs in due time.</li>
<li>Repeat as needed to avoid reporting FTDs and pretend like you covered.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this helped cleared up the inner workings of the process for some of you.</p>
<p>See you all tomorrow</p>
