If this helps push price up even a tiny bit this topic needs to be resurrected because it might be one of the only ways to counteract buys being diverted into dark pools.\n\nThe IEX exchange was setup to protect retail investors and was fought heavily by hedge funds when it was established (I wonder why).  You may need to go into your account settings to be able to select IEX vs the default which would be called something like \"smart exchange\" AKA KG keeps your buy from helping to push the price up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow is an example from TDA of what you want selected and how to set it up explained in another post:\n\n[TDA HOW TO IEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mq8opq/how_to_use_investors_exchange_iex_with_td/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/901cvsqjalu61.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=369701124ab0faa231693eb91e16f1b2aeb07fb5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf others comment for other brokers I will add to the post\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEDIT 1: A great post on IEX [IEX OVERVIEW](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mqb42g/i_know_a_lot_about_iex_let_me_explain_to_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) written by  u/Rs_Spacers\n\nEDIT 2:  This is an opinion on buying stock only and not for selling.\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 3: Cool video posted by u/WarioFangirl68  \\- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8BcCLLX4N4)\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 4: Fidelity post added by u/lucioghosty in the comments below [Fidelity Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mq7l4h/fidelity_users_you_can_manually_route_your_trades/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExpanding on Fidelity with a post made by Fidelity:\n\nHi u/AllCredits, directed trading is available using our Active Trader Pro (ATP) software (which is free to use for all clients of Fidelity). While IEX currently is not available for directed trading, we do offer order routing to many different exchanges in ATP. The directed trading feature can be accessed in ATP by going to the menu for \u201cTrade &amp; Orders\u201d then selecting \u201cDirected Trade &amp; Extended Hours.\u201d  Please visit Fidelity.com to learn more about how Fidelity manages order flow and trade execution quality to save you money.\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 5: Wealth Simple Trading Broker \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ms8q2w/apes_using_wealth_simple_trading_broker_here_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf \n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 6: I\u2019ve seen posts about apes attempting to route via IEX but the trade ends up running through citadel.  I share the opinion this Is because Citadel has the only GME liquidity left in the market with their counterfeit shares so when your broker tries to execute IEX if it cant it defaults to most favorable option.  By routing via IEX even if it does go Citadels way for the liquidity reason it should still help by forcing the buys to go through something other than dark pools. This means it\u2019s at least being counted towards volume and buy pressure. I need someone smarter to validate this thinking.  \n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 7: degiro \n _________________________________________________________________________\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DEGIRO/comments/mrb1y4/possible_to_route_trades_over_iex_with_degiro/gul89fc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3\n\nEdit 8:  IEX was created to mitigate the advantage  HFT gives hedge funds. Read or watch flash boys for an Ape friendly summary of the birth of IEX. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys \n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 9: https://iextrading.com/trading/#members\nIEX Supported Brokerage Member list\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 10: sounds like interactive brokers allows you to select routing to IEX. I am still digging of Schwab - trying to see if their TDA connection opens it up \n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 11: WEALTHSIMPLE - Response u/-CasaNova- received from their support team:\n\nHi *******,\n\nHope you are doing well and thank you for reaching out!\n\nUnfortunately you do not have an option to change the routing method of your orders, however I have forwarded this feedback to our team for more visibility!\n\nIf there's anything else I can help you with please reach out and enjoy the rest of your day!\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 12 - REVOLUT - Not currently supporting IEX - Confirmed ny u/gme2uranus\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is not financial advice.  Do your homework on the exchange you trade through.  This is just one apes opinion. I am not a financial advisor.",
