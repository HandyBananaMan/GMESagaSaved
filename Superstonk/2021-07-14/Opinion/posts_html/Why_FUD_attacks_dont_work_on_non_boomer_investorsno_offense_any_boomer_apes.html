<p>Disclaimer: when I mention “we” or “our” I’m referring to younger generations not investment groups. Each person is an individual investor who makes their own decision.</p>
<p>Hedgies are getting desperate. I’ve seen a tweet from Cramer today bashing millennials and them asking for money from their parents. There’s a copypasta going around saying they lost everything.</p>
<p>Hey hedgefucks most apes grew up with the internet. We’ve been systematically trained to recognize manipulation. Hell many of our parents followed parenting books that promoted abuse and gas lighting. We all are aging including the manipulators and I doubt many of us are in our teens.</p>
<p>So many apes grew up where gaming and the internet was their therapy and escape. We’ve played against aimbots. We’ve played against Zerg rushers. Lag switches, abusive pms, meta exploits. We’ve had to formulate plans on the fly and despite odds being stacked against us we’ve pushed  on to not let the minority of unsophisticated gamers ruin our fun. We’ve had people pretend to be your friend and proceed to team kill you. Hell even our single player games we regularly get tricked and have to evolve to beat them.</p>
<p>Growing up with the internet we are use to filtering lies. I mean fuck even our dating apps are filled with bots trying to scam us out of money. </p>
<p>We were sold the lie of retirement if we did everything right and many are student loan debt slaves. We saw the lies told to send many of us to a farce of a war. We saw how scammy cable tv was and cut the cord. We witness corruption in real time. The realization the American dream is a lie.</p>
<p>Financial scarcity has always been part of our every day battle. How do you win against someone who has nothing to lose? You don’t play. Citadel fell for the most classic blunder, you never play a game against someone with nothing to lose and gain everything in a win. You can’t demoralize people who rock bottom is the norm. </p>
<p>They try to use the same manipulation tactics using new platforms but old tricks. So if you’re listening psych department that totally doesn’t exist, nothing you do will work because you weren’t born in the system that we’ve lived on a daily basis.</p>
<p>This game is over. It’s essentially an RTS where they are hiding the remnants of their base, hoping we get bored. When it ends they are going to complain to the developers as a last ditch effort for a bailout. I believe times are a changing and we will be “dancing” as the other outcome is complete loss of faith in US markets.</p>
<p>Tl;dr buy hodl, hedgies r fuk</p>
<p>Edit: For hedgies, the day Apes graced your market was the most important day of your life. But for Apes, it was Wednesday.</p>
