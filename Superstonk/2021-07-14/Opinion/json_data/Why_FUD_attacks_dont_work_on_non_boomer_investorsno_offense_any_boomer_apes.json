Each person is an individual investor who makes their own decision.\n\nHedgies are getting desperate. I\u2019ve seen a tweet from Cramer today bashing millennials and them asking for money from their parents. There\u2019s a copypasta going around saying they lost everything.\n\nHey hedgefucks most apes grew up with the internet. We\u2019ve been systematically trained to recognize manipulation. Hell many of our parents followed parenting books that promoted abuse and gas lighting. We all are aging including the manipulators and I doubt many of us are in our teens.\n\nSo many apes grew up where gaming and the internet was their therapy and escape. We\u2019ve played against aimbots. We\u2019ve played against Zerg rushers. Lag switches, abusive pms, meta exploits. We\u2019ve had to formulate plans on the fly and despite odds being stacked against us we\u2019ve pushed  on to not let the minority of unsophisticated gamers ruin our fun. We\u2019ve had people pretend to be your friend and proceed to team kill you. Hell even our single player games we regularly get tricked and have to evolve to beat them.\n\nGrowing up with the internet we are use to filtering lies. I mean fuck even our dating apps are filled with bots trying to scam us out of money. \n\nWe were sold the lie of retirement if we did everything right and many are student loan debt slaves. We saw the lies told to send many of us to a farce of a war. We saw how scammy cable tv was and cut the cord. We witness corruption in real time. The realization the American dream is a lie.\n\nFinancial scarcity has always been part of our every day battle. How do you win against someone who has nothing to lose? You don\u2019t play. Citadel fell for the most classic blunder, you never play a game against someone with nothing to lose and gain everything in a win. You can\u2019t demoralize people who rock bottom is the norm. \n\nThey try to use the same manipulation tactics using new platforms but old tricks. So if you\u2019re listening psych department that totally doesn\u2019t exist, nothing you do will work because you weren\u2019t born in the system that we\u2019ve lived on a daily basis.\n\nThis game is over. It\u2019s essentially an RTS where they are hiding the remnants of their base, hoping we get bored. When it ends they are going to complain to the developers as a last ditch effort for a bailout. I believe times are a changing and we will be \u201cdancing\u201d as the other outcome is complete loss of faith in US markets.\n\nTl;dr buy hodl, hedgies r fuk\n\nEdit: For hedgies, the day Apes graced your market was the most important day of your life. But for Apes, it was Wednesday.",
