    "selftext": "We know GameStop is working with the SEC. We can assume they know how we\u2019ve read into RC\u2019s tweets to pull out dates, and nothing more blatantly than the NFT launch date. We know that so far none of these hype days have done anything more than spread false expectation and lead to lower prices.\n\nWe think the hedgies are shorting specifically on those dates in an effort to demoralise us. I wonder then: is GameStop building hype out of nothing so SEC can witness market manipulation in action, and build a case to let these fuckers burn when they try to crash the economy at America\u2019s expense?\n\nSmooth brained and probably wrong. But I wonder\u2026\ud83e\udd14\n\nMoon soon. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
