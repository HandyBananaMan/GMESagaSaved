And the price drops almost 7% on 3,700,000 volume. Thats a flex, because they can. Its a fuck-you to apes on Bastille day, because they can.\n\nI'm zen, I dont need to pile furniture to blockage the streets like they did in the french revolution. I'll just watch as Citadel kicks the can and digs a deeper grave.\n\nHang in there apes. Im buying more tickets to the moon tomorrow!\n\nPower to the mother fucking players!!!!",
