    "selftext": "The blatant and criminal act of market manipulation using dark pools to re route a majority of retail buy orders and the consistent shorting and dodging of ftds by using married puts should be enough proof that Citadel is exploiting the MM privileges they have been granted.\n\nJust imagine any other party doing this in your face criminal market moves and they would get fucked faster in the arse by the sec than they could say \"gimme a banana\".\n\nIt is making me furious and strengthening my grip on my gme shares by the minute I think about it. The sec needs to be defunded and not the us police. The true criminals of this world are the thieves that have been stealing the money of hard working folks through the years and blaming everything else on it like nature or the lower class.\n\nThis blind greed and entitlement to market control has to end!",
