    "selftext": "These are criminals we are dealing with. And sociopathic ones at that.\n\nThey've robbed the bank, killed the guard, and taken hostages. The authorities have guns drawn on the exits, and there's an angry mob waiting to financially rip them to pieces. We can likely assume these mother fuckers have already decided they have no intention of being taken into custody. \n\nThey are going to try to shoot their way out, even with virtually no chance of success. They've already broken so many laws, whats a few more? Shooting back the cops in broad daylight and annihilating themselves in the process might be the only choice they have left.\n\nExpect the blatant illegality and manipulation to get much worse, before things get better.\n\nIt is on the other side of their dramatic and desperate end, that our rocket towards Andromeda departs, fellow Apes.\n\nBuy. Hold. Laugh.",
