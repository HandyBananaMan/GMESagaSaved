A nice little fuck you to the great unwashed ape masses from our elite ruling class overlords. 

80%+ buy sentiments on all major trading platforms. And the price drops almost 7% on 3,700,000 volume. Thats a flex, because they can. Its a fuck-you to apes on Bastille day, because they can.

I'm zen, I dont need to pile furniture to blockage the streets like they did in the french revolution. I'll just watch as Citadel kicks the can and digs a deeper grave.

Hang in there apes. Im buying more tickets to the moon tomorrow!

Power to the mother fucking players!!!!
