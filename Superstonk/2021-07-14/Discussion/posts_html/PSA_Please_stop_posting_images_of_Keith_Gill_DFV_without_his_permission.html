<p>Edit: Imma need to get therapy after reading all of the insults here. Seriously guys, tone it down a bit. Itâ€™s just my opinion </p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm specifically referring to the people *digging* for photos. Popular common photos are okay in my opinion, but going out of your way to find old photos and whatnot is creepy, disrespectful and just crosses the line</p>
<p>It's time to stop digging for photos of Keith to post here without his permission. This community has over half a million members, and if you put yourself in his shoes for a second, you'd probably understand this is a no-brainer. It's been an issue for months now, and the recent post of Keith at a gaming venue (I think) was the final straw. Please be respectful.</p>
<p>"But it's not illegal" - Well you should at least have the common decency to respect his privacy.</p>
<p>"I'm sure he would be okay with it" - No you're not sure. Because you don't have his permission.</p>
<p>"We are still being respectful though" - No you aren't. Not when you post his images to a community of over half a million without his permission.</p>
<p>"They're publicly accessible" - So are your old photos on Facebook, but you wouldn't want someone to go posting them to a huge Reddit community.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.</p>
