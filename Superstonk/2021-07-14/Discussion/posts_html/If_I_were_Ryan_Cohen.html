<p>Let’s play some 4D chess.</p>
<p>GameStop is aware that all good news is met with major attack to kill hype. </p>
<p>Every. Single. Time. </p>
<p>I would take this pattern and use it against them by starting the most incognito reverse FUD move stock has ever seen. </p>
<p>Step one, pepper in tons of 7/14 references that only apes pick up on via Twitter, crypto codes, you name it. </p>
<p>Step two, let apes find bread crumb trail and hype the date to the point that listening shills report back to palpatine overlords as probable launch date. </p>
<p>Step three, shills think they are big brained and set up massive FUD attack and price drop for that date to counteract said launch date. </p>
<p>Step four, apes are fucking un-breakable so we go about our business like any day letting SHF swing at nothing but air while we buy tasty dip.</p>
<p>Step five, drop bomb day after or couple days after when SHF have spent all ammo and can’t do shit to shut down hype. </p>
<p>The opponent whether it be table top, boxing, or warfare that approaches first almost always is disadvantaged. </p>
<p>Just food for thought. I’m hodling no matter what happens this week, month, or year.</p>
<p>Edit: this my a response to a comment, but I think I could be more clear up here, “It takes awhile to get their shit together, between shorting etfs, dropping crypto, coordinating media fud etc, it is a lot of effort for them. I agree, they will attack it again, I’m talking more about timing than anything.”</p>
<p>Edit 2 for extra smooth apes: “yes they can come up with fake shares blah blah, I’m not talking about exhausting them completely. I’m talking about releasing company news in a window of time that catches them off guard and ill-prepared. That way the stock price can reflect positive news. There is always a gap between two swings.”</p>
