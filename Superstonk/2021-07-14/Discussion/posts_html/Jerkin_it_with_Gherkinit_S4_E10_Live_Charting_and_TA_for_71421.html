<p>Happy Bastille Day to all the Cornichons !</p>
<p>and Good Morning SuperStonk!</p>
<p>I was fucking around with my crayons last night trying to sharpen my Magic Mint^(TM.) While try to jam it into the back of the box I noticed something while staring intently at ADX all of these things are like the other.</p>

<p>Does this mean anything, IDK...But, I've been doing this stuff for a long time and I know patterns like to repeat themselves. Anyway it doesn't take a lot to get my titz jacckked to the moon!</p>

<p>Edit 2 10:48</p>
<p>Market's on a downtrend looks like a red day but we had an ok bounce at 175 that pattern I found earlier on the ADX looks like we could have another down day or 2 before moving up.</p>

<p>Edit 1 9:45</p>
<p>Little opening dip in the first 15 volume looks better today though</p>

<h1>Pre-Market Analysis</h1>
<p>Significantly more volume this morning at 26k with 150k shares available to borrow. While we haven't see a lot go on with the stock today there has been an all out whale war going on on the options chain this week as low IV has incentivized long whale to play leveraged positions, I expect this to really pick up today as we get buffeted about MM's attempting to remain <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp">delta-neutral</a>.</p>
