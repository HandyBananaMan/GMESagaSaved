While try to jam it into the back of the box I noticed something while staring intently at ADX all of these things are like the other.\n\n[Historical ADX on GME's 1D Timescale](https://preview.redd.it/n7tcudl866b71.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&s=456008af1fb6c3925f8ed3e4f82c00c73fc6223f)\n\nDoes this mean anything, IDK...But, I've been doing this stuff for a long time and I know patterns like to repeat themselves. Anyway it doesn't take a lot to get my titz jacckked to the moon!\n\nIf you guys haven't had a chance to [Check out this weeks forward looking TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oi6c88/jerkin_it_with_gherkinit_forward_looking_ta_for/)\n\nJoin us in the Daily Livestream [https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial](https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial)\n\nOr listen along with our live audio feed on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HbqnUVsSrH)\n\n(save these links in case reddit goes down)\n\n*(this post will read from top to bottom)*\n\n(*feel free to ask me questions below, but if you can google it yourself please use common sense)*\n\nHistorical Resistance/Support:\n\n116.5, 125.5, 132.5, 141, 145, 147.5, 150, 152.5, **157 (previous ATM offering)**, 158.5, 162.5, 163, 165.5, 172, 174, 176.5, 179, 180.5, 182, 183.5, 184.5, 186, 187.5, 190.5, 192, 195, 196.5, 197.5, 200, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, **225.20 (new ATM offering)** 226, 232.5, 235, 242.5, 250, 255, 262.5, 275, 280, 285, 300, 302.50, 310, 317.50, 325, 332.5, 340, 350, 400, 483, moon base...\n\nEdit 2 10:48\n\nMarket's on a downtrend looks like a red day but we had an ok bounce at 175 that pattern I found earlier on the ADX looks like we could have another down day or 2 before moving up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/guzvyudky6b71.png?width=1635&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ba3e60f37cb12d09e3fc5200458544cc1fe332f\n\nEdit 1 9:45\n\nLittle opening dip in the first 15 volume looks better today though\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwwws0n6n6b71.png?width=1640&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d72db86806b70594074265e9f9dfdf33b5029e\n\n# Pre-Market Analysis\n\nSignificantly more volume this morning at 26k with 150k shares available to borrow. While we haven't see a lot go on with the stock today there has been an all out whale war going on on the options chain this week as low IV has incentivized long whale to play leveraged positions, I expect this to really pick up today as we get buffeted about MM's attempting to remain [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqolkenqb6b71.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c522825572751db399bd471b7fe7f96e7fd342a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j55s6umhb6b71.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=935ed6976e2950ed5d55279e6022408264b2f652\n\nDisclaimer\n\n*\\* Although my profession is day trading, I in no way endorse day-trading of GME not only does it present significant risk, it can delay the squeeze.*\n\n*\\*My YouTube channel is \"monetized\" if that is something you are uncomfortable with, I understand, while I wouldn't say I profit greatly from the views, I do suggest you use ad-block when viewing it if you feel so compelled.* *My intention is simply benefit this community.
