Edit: Imma need to get therapy after reading all of the insults here. Seriously guys, tone it down a bit. Itâ€™s just my opinion 

Edit 2: I'm specifically referring to the people \*digging\* for photos. Popular common photos are okay in my opinion, but going out of your way to find old photos and whatnot is creepy, disrespectful and just crosses the line

It's time to stop digging for photos of Keith to post here without his permission. This community has over half a million members, and if you put yourself in his shoes for a second, you'd probably understand this is a no-brainer. It's been an issue for months now, and the recent post of Keith at a gaming venue (I think) was the final straw. Please be respectful.

"But it's not illegal" - Well you should at least have the common decency to respect his privacy.

"I'm sure he would be okay with it" - No you're not sure. Because you don't have his permission.

"We are still being respectful though" - No you aren't. Not when you post his images to a community of over half a million without his permission.

"They're publicly accessible" - So are your old photos on Facebook, but you wouldn't want someone to go posting them to a huge Reddit community.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
