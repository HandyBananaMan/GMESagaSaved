#Title: If they’d tried the slow bleed back in January it might have worked. But their brutal, dominating, cruel natures dictated a severe response. They overplayed their hand. The personality structure that got them to the top ended up being their undoing.

They underestimated the will of retail from the beginning. That shouldn’t be surprising since they reached their positions of power by steamrolling anyone who got in their path. They probably prided themselves on the strength of their wills. They saw that inner need to dominate and control as an asset to be utilized, not a deficit to be corrected. And now it’s going to cost them everything.
