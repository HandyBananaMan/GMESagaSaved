<p>I realize that this may immediately raise red flags and that’s warranted. </p>
<p>I also realize that, lacking concrete proof, I’m unlikely to totally convince you. That’s ok, I don’t blame you - tbh discernment is important and I doubt I’d believe me if I were you. </p>
<p>I’ve contacted a couple of the mods and (hopefully) convinced them enough to at least let me post. u/rensole</p>
<p>I previously posted here under the name u/leavemeanon. I authored the “Where are the Shares?” series and ultimately nuked my Reddit account along with several other social media accounts. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nt8t9n/rip_uleavemeanon_where_are_the_shares_part_3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">It was ultimately reposted</a>, which I was glad for. Seeing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ok2e0b/a_castle_of_glass_game_on_anon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">this post</a> referencing me from earlier today, I felt I should clear some things up. </p>
<p>u/3for100Specials noted in their post that some of the intrigue was generated by the mystery of my previous account, but nothing I have to say here will weaken that post whatsoever. It’s fascinating stuff, and I need to look into it further because I know very little on that front. </p>
<p>Which brings me to my first point - I’m really not very mysterious. I’m not RC or DFV or MB. I was being honest when I said I knew virtually nothing about markets 6 months ago. I’m a crayon eating, FUD blasting, diamond hodling, ape. A true autist as our.. cousins might say lol</p>
<p>Which, of course, begs the question of why I nuked my account after all the time spent on the posts. </p>
<p>In all honesty, it was an impulsive decision made out of fear. I’m not proud of that, but I can also say that the week of posting part 3 was, without a shadow of a doubt, the weirdest week of my entire life. </p>
<p>I was going to go into detail but I’ll just leave it at that for now. </p>
<p>To the extent that the (inadvertent) intrigue around me caused more apes to dig deeper, it was a happy accident. </p>
<p>I’m also not Bob Ross.</p>
<p>And if my week of weirdness taught me anything, it’s that coincidences.. do just happen sometimes. Questioning coincidences is great, but they do, unfortunately, exist. </p>
<p>For instance - u/leavemeanon was created to post personal opinions in a strategy game I was once well known in. I saw the other day that DFV was well known in some card game once. See? Coincidence^simulation </p>
<p>As for the text involved with the NFT: “GAME ON ANON” - I’m 99.99% sure it’s coincidental^proofofsimulation</p>
<p>I know this is probably not the juicy post you came here for, but I felt it was important to be truthful. It doesn’t take insider knowledge or financial genius to change the world. It takes trust and transparency.</p>
<p>Hopefully I net a little Karma here so I can discuss further with you guys.</p>
