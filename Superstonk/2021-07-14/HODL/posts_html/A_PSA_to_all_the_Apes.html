<p>$80 Million Dollars to short the stock this week. </p>
<p>This is the price of our resolve.</p>
<p>There is no price too great for them to save their asses at this point. There is nobody they won't try to turn.</p>
<p>TA doesn't matter</p>
<p>DDs don't matter</p>
<p>Drama Doesn't Matter</p>
<p>Ignore the FUD </p>
<p>Ignore the price</p>
<p>Ignore the negativity</p>
<p>We all know the most important fact, the only thing that matters. 
The shorts haven't covered...</p>
<p>Everything else is bullshit. 
HODL the Line.
We've already won. </p>
