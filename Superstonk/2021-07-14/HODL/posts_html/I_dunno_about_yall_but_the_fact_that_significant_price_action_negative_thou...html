<p>That's about it.</p>
<p>I mean there were a lot of interpretations of cryptic messages etc, but I'll be damned if <em>something</em> didn't happen on the predicted date.</p>
<p>I think it's more likely <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/">u/criand</a> is calling it correctly, that 7/16 is the first major option expiry date with the 801 and 802 rules in effect (maybe enforced? they're enforceable at least). If I remember what they put forth correctly, this should force SHF to have to post capital/collateral requirements by (end of AH?) today for the options likely expiring worthless (i.e. those bagillion super low SP puts used to hide naked shorts).</p>
<p>Much excite for next 24 hours!</p>
