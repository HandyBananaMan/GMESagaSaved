This documentary is eye opening. I’ve seen a few familiar names pop up (Nomura, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan Chase, B of A)

 ANYWAY! I learned that derivatives essentially allowed banks to make super risky trades which was one of the things that led to the crisis. GG was head of the commodity futures trading commission and helped ban regulations on derivatives.

My takeaway? Be very wary of those in the financial sector who say they are going to help. they most likely won’t because they have a load of cash waiting for them after they leave office.

I also learned that a lot of the economics professors at universities are paid by Wall Street to teach deregulation as a good thing 

GameStop is the financial worlds Achilles heel and we have em! It’s so scary to see how much of a hold they have on the world but we have 
[one](https://tenor.com/view/benedict-cumberbatch-endgame-doctor-strange-one-one-more-gif-14162332) opportunity to finally break the choke hold the rich have on the world and make it a better place. The fear i have of what the banks are doing is fueling my strength to hold for as long as possible. This is the fight of our lives. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀
