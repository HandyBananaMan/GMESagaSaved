$80 Million Dollars to short the stock this week. 

This is the price of our resolve.

There is no price too great for them to save their asses at this point. There is nobody they won't try to turn.

TA doesn't matter

DDs don't matter

Drama Doesn't Matter

Ignore the FUD 

Ignore the price

Ignore the negativity

We all know the most important fact, the only thing that matters. 
The shorts haven't covered...

Everything else is bullshit. 
HODL the Line.
We've already won.
