 That's about it.

I mean there were a lot of interpretations of cryptic messages etc, but I'll be damned if *something* didn't happen on the predicted date.

I think it's more likely [u/criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/criand/) is calling it correctly, that 7/16 is the first major option expiry date with the 801 and 802 rules in effect (maybe enforced? they're enforceable at least). If I remember what they put forth correctly, this should force SHF to have to post capital/collateral requirements by (end of AH?) today for the options likely expiring worthless (i.e. those bagillion super low SP puts used to hide naked shorts).

Much excite for next 24 hours!

Edit (8pm EST):

 - thanks for awards and all the votes! 
 - wow, dumped almost as much AH as during reg hours!
 - muuüuùuūuuûuúuuch excite, 💎✋🦍🚀 HODL!
