<p>I've gotten requests and been pinged to dissect earnings for multiple banks but with a lack of time I'll probably only get 1 or 2 done tonight. That said, I know a lot of folks are pumped so lets get started with the most requested bank.</p>
<p><strong><em>By popular demand, a running count of a net revenue declines for 3 banks so far: \~$3.81 Billion (JP, GS, BoA)</em></strong></p>
<p>Next up on our road show for applying cheat codes is <strong>Bank Of America (BoA).</strong></p>
<p>This is my run-down on the portion of <em>Investment Banking</em> and <em>Global Markets</em> portion of BoA's earnings report. I've seen some people get this confused with the banks overall performance. This is not indicative of other earnings in the earnings report and just an overview of the net revenue for the <em>Investment Banking</em> and <em>Global Markets</em> portion of the banks earnings. I hope this clears the air for some that may have been confused by my last posts.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: The story hasn't changed much among the banks. Bad performance among FICC/bonds, more deposits (but they excluded DVA foR some reason. I'll define DVA before we start), more investor leverage/margin in derivatives, and now I’m realizing that they’ve released provisions/allowances to boost revenue. BoA "outperformed" our friends by only posting a slump in net revenue of 4% or \~$860 Million. Below I'll dive deeper into specifics showing how much smarter BoA is than others in fudging numbers.</strong> <strong>In other words, the house of cards is crumbling and we've been watching it this entire time and we called it. Thanks to this amazing GAMING community I've realized we missed a cheat-code. Enter cheat-code(s): SHOW ME THE MONEY + BLACK SHEEP WALL</strong></p>
<p>I found the DVA mashed in fine print between the 18 pages and took into account the DVA for the earnings. Seems like they tried to hide it from people who dont like to read these reports. Hmm.. Fuckery is afoot. Anyways, you should understand CVA and DVA to realize the impact it can have in the numbers. Definitions are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><em>Credit Value Adjustment (CVA)</em></strong> is the amount subtracted from the mark-to-market (MTM) value of derivative positions to account for the expected loss due to counterparty defaults. CVA is easy to understand in the context of a loan – it is the loan principal, minus anticipated recovery, multiplied by the counterparty’s default probability over the term of the loan. <strong>For derivatives, the loan amount is the net MTM value of derivative positions with that counterparty.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Debt Value Adjustment (DVA)</em></strong> is simply CVA from the counterparty’s perspective. If one party incurs a CVA loss, the other party records a corresponding DVA gain. <strong>DVA is the amount added back to the MTM value to account for the expected gain from an institution’s own default.</strong> Including DVA (in addition to CVA) is intuitively pleasing because both parties report the same credit-adjusted MTM value. DVA is also controversial because institutions record gains when their credit quality deteriorates, creating perverse incentives, and these gains can only be realized on default.</p>
<p>Now, the meat and potatoes:</p>
<p>Bank Of America posted a net revenue slump of $860 Million (-4%) to $21.5 Billion. They attribute their decline to a decline in Net Interest Income and Noninterest income. Net Interest income was down 6% to $10.2 Billion and driven by lower interest rates. Noninterest income was down 2% to $11.2 Billion and driven by lower sales and trading revenue but partially offset by higher Consumer and Wealth Management revenues. So lets dive a bit deeper, shall we?</p>
<p><strong><em>Investment Banking:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Actually performed well at a record revenue of $5.1 Billion for BoA which is up by 14% driven by $656 Million gains in asset management fees. This and lower credit costs caused a Net Income Increase of 59% or $368 Million to $991 Million.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total client balances were up $725 Billion or 25% to a RECORD OF $3.7 TRILLION</strong> driven by higher market valuations and positive client flows.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Average deposits increased $46 Billion or 16% to $333 Billion.</em> <strong><em>Average loans and leases grew $12 Billion or 6% to $194 Billion and was driven by securities-based lending and custom lending</em></strong>*.* THIS IS A PRETTY BIG EFFING DEAL. Correct me if I'm wrong, but BoA clients are using their securities to acquire loans. Once the market crashes this is going to make the value of those securities drop and could cause mayhem among loans like these.</li>
<li><em>BoA also had $11.7 Billion in assets under management (AUM) in Q2 which is a</em> <strong><em>DECLINE OF $6.5 BILLION FROM Q1 2021.</em></strong> <em>Not sure how normal this is but it doesn't seem like a normal decline for 1 quarter. It looks like most of this decline comes from BoA and not Merrill Lynch.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merrill Lynch (owned by BoA) saw record numbers of growth in many aspects of the company:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>25% growth in client balances which totals to $3.1 Trillion.</li>
<li>29% growth in assets under management (AUM) to a total of $1.2 Trillion</li>
<li>Addition of \~6000 net new households in Q2</li>
<li>7% growth in mobile app usage to 39%</li>
<li>6% growth in automated check deposits through automated channels grew to 51% of all eligible checks deposited.</li>
</ul>
<p>You thought this was fun? <strong>THIS IS WHERE IT GETS JUICY BABY</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>GLOBAL MARKETS:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NET REVENUE DECLINED \~$1.5 BILLION TO \~$4.7 BILLION FROM \~$6.2 BILLION</strong> and was driven by lower sales and trading results from the same period a year ago. <em>(Excluding Net DVA would make this seem better by only $34 Million).</em></li>
<li><strong>"Net income decreased $987 million to $908 million" MORE THAN A 50% DECLINE! HOLY SMOKES BATMAN!</strong> <em>(Excluding Net DVA would make this seem better by only $26 Million).</em></li>
<li>Noninterest expense increased by $787 Million or 29% to $3.5 Billion and was driven by higher costs associated with processing state unemployment benefit claims and activity-related expenses in sales and trading.</li>
<li>The average Value At Risk saw a climb from $74 Million (Q1-2021) to $77 Million (Q2-2021). <strong><em>VaR measures and quantifies the level of financial risk within a firm, portfolio or position over a specific time frame (3 years for BoA). The fact that this is trend is increasing again can’t be good for BoA. Queue red flags.</em></strong> In the last year this was at its highest during COVID at $81 Million.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sales and trading revenue was $3.6 Billion and is a <strong>DECLINE OF $1.5 BILLION COMPARED TO Q1!</strong> *(Excluding Net DVA made no difference here).*This falls into 2 buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>FICC/Bond Revenue of $1.9 Billion. <strong>FICC revenue declined 38%</strong> "as the prior year benefited from a robust trading environment for macro products and strengthening markets for credit products after their pandemic related sell-off, whereas markets in Q2-21 were more benign and weak for agency mortgages". In other words, they didn’t see this coming and didn’t adjust for it in time.</li>
<li>Equities Revenue of $1.6 Billion. This is a growth of 33% due to stronger trading performance and increased client activity in derivatives and Asia. Basically, they recouped some of their losses on some trades plus fees collected from option trading and the Asian market.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>While DVA made a difference of a cool $60 Million to their bottom line and wasnt significant for BoA I still find it interesting.</em></p>
<p>Since I did it for Goldman Sachs one last thing I'd like to point out for Bank Of America is their Allowance for Credit losses. This is the amount of money they have in reserves to cover losses from credit risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $2.1 billion</li>
<li>Nonperforming loans decreased $255 million</li>
<li>Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure  decreased $5.4 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>Credit Provisions also were reduced and reserves were released as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer reserve release of $1.2 billion</li>
<li>Commercial reserve release of $1.0 billion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit: These provisions and allowance releases are really a big reason why way BoA was able to turn a net gain. Wild.</strong></p>
<p>Edit2: added provisions and allowances to TL;DR as additional trend I’ve seen that’s used to bolster revenue.</p>
<p>Some other apes were going to help proof-read this but weren't available when I pinged them or haven't responded, so if you find errors or faults in this DD please comment or DM me. Since its already late I'll be completing Black Rock, PNC, Citi Group and Wells Fargo later this week so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Obligatory F in the comments for Bank Of America.</p>
<p><em>This is not financial advice and is just my opinion on what the earnings report means for Goldman Sachs. I'm just a retard who likes to gamble and loves GameStop stock.</em></p>
