TL;DR - New rules #801 & #802 MAY be working their magic. JP Morgan is going to do intraday checks with all the hedgefucks that use their funds to "invest" and make sure they meet the MINIMUM daily SLD requirements.

If they can't, the DTCC can LIQUIDATE their assets to cover their short positions until they do. They can also "block" any "member" that they deem is a "liability" to the DTCC, SEC & basically the rest of Wall Street.

The DTCC can force ALL members to help cover any "debts" that any of these "liable" companies may incur through their "actions". ðŸ˜‰

Oh yeah, I'm fucking jacked to the tits! See you beautiful APES on the MOON soon ðŸš€ ðŸŒ•

Here we go!

I just posted about this:

[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/7/13/15625-21.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/7/13/15625-21.pdf)

This is one of JP Morgan's account with the DTCC. Apparently there are reports of them having like 30 accounts. Ok that's fine, I don't dispute that ***statement*** unless I can prove it otherwise. But the fact remains that one of the accounts is closing down. So we can agree on that simple fact.

\*\*\*\*\*EDIT 7/15/21\*\*\*\*\*

Found out that JPMorgan only had their accounts "retired" by the DTCC only 2 times in HISTORY!

I've seen people claiming, "It's nothing! Business as usual!".

Really?  Business is as usual when only 2 of your accounts has EVER been closed according to [DTCC.com](https://DTCC.com) records?  Both recent too! 

I believe the "Canada" retired account was in connection with this ruling made recently by the SEC found on the Reg Sho. (Don't quote me on this, I haven't searched to confirm this yet, I think this was jogged from my memory)

Ummm... Ok, I'm sure you used DD and verified by just simply looking a little "deeper" right?  I mean a 5 second search pulled this up.  Guess your time is too precious to look?

Looks like YouTubers are a lot more "news anchors" rather than real "reporters".

\*\*\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*\*\*

I do have a theory, and as with any theory, I can be right or I could be wrong. We won't know unless if someone can dig up verifiable proof to disprove my theory, or ends up truly becoming result of something possibly big. Who knows right now. I just want to share this with you.

This is the data I dug up and why I feel that this is all connected as it is. You make your own conclusions with everything presented here.

Now an article released TODAY says this!

What does this remind you of?

Remember all those little "rules" that we got so excited about not too long ago?

SR-DTC-2021-002 in particular?

Shall we revisit it for just a quick moment? You remember this guy right?

Yeah, this is the one that increases the SLD minimum requirements right?

Also remember this little guy?

SR-NSCC-2021-801?

Hmm...."Proposed Intraday Supplemental Liquidity Calls" huh?

Yep that's right, this allows them to check on hedge funds to ensure that they are within the daily minimum SLD requirements. According to JP Morgan, they're gonna check up to 7 times a damn day to ensure these hedgefucks are able to "reasonably" cover their short positions!

Don't forget the part that ALLOWS the DTCC to "block" members of the party in the event they do things to become a liability to the DTCC, SEC, & other financial enforcing entities. They will be pushed out like black sheep to have them take care of their own fucked up "business" they have made for themselves.

Also another fantastic rule they put in place to protect themselves from these "liabilities" is allowing them to force upon other DTCC members to "share" in the debt responsibility if any should ever occur ðŸ˜‰ That way not only "one" member is responsible, but ALL of them will be held responsible to pay the debt of the "offending" party!

EDIT:

Even though I couldn't confirm any other source of the [Risk.net](https://Risk.net) article, I did find this:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-is-hoarding-cash-because-very-good-chance-inflation-here-to-stay.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-is-hoarding-cash-because-very-good-chance-inflation-here-to-stay.html)

It's no secret that banks are hoarding cash. They know something HUGE is gonna happen and it won't be pretty. So requiring more "liquidity" from their clients makes complete sense. They want to "protect" their "hoards" of cash they're stockpiling right now.

I don't believe this will be the last we'll hear of this. I can almost guarantee you that this is going to happen with ALL banks soon enough. Just a theory, but keep a lookout for it and remember this post if it comes to fruition soon.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Yeah, I know, it's wishful thinking but these are the RULES that have been set into place. Now is this truly the culmination of all of this going into effect? Finally moving the cogs in this system to fix it? Man I hope so!

If JP Morgan is admitting they're going to do this, who next? BOA, Credit Suisse, etc?

Either way, **BUY & HODL**! This is the ultimate recipe for our MOASS success!

Do remember these few things:

1. Make sure to turn off share lending with your broker. If you have your shares with a "shady" broker (names of which can be found thru various threads here on this subReddit), then make sure to switch to a more reliable one such as Fidelity.
2. Day trading HURTS our cause on the daily. Since there is a T2+ clearing dates on trades, it can give them up to 4 additional days with which hedge fucks like Shitadel can use to cause fuckery with.
3. Don't worry about the price. There is not date but we know from all the evidence we are seeing, the day is coming soon my fellow APE!

" JP Morgan warns hedge funds to expect intraday margin calls

*July 13, 2021*

Author: Nell Mackenzie

JP Morgan is warning hedge funds clients that it will demand they post more cash at any time during the day if their trades lose value.

The biggest US bank by assets called clients of its prime brokerage division in the aftermath of the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, according to three people familiar with the matter. JP Morgan told the hedge funds and family offices that they would have to post more collateral on their single-name equity swap positions if they lost value intraday.

Banks collect margin from hedge funds to cover potential losses if a fund fails. Prime brokerage divisions ask for initial margin when a hedge fund enters a levered position and then give themselves the ability to demand variation margin if the market moves against the client.

The right to demand variation margin is included in many contractual agreements with prime brokerage units. Hedge funds rarely seek to change them because until Archegos. they were rarely enforced.

"The JP Morgan standard prime brokerage agreement actually says that they can call you whenever they want for variation margin - like you can get up to seven calls a day" says a head of treasury at a large US hedge fund. "It's up to you to negotiate that." A spokesman for JP Morgan declined to comment.

The default of Archegos at the end of March triggered losses at multiple investment banks, including a mammoth $4.7 billion loss at Credit Suisse, which collected less margin from Archegos than the likes of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.

None of the hedge funds that [Risk.net](https://risk.net/) spoke to have received intraday variation margin calls from JP Morgan, but they all fear that they will have to pay up in the future. The chief financial officer of one US hedge fund says that he was shocked when JP Morgan said it would exercise its legal right to make margin calls multiple times a day.

"I have worked at small firms and multi-billion-dollar firms and this was a first", he says. "I was surprised to hear this."

Prime brokers that provide leverage to hedge funds collect two types of margin from clients: initial margin, which is set periodically based on the credit risk posed by the fund; and the variation margin, which is calculated daily and covers mark-to-market losses.

In prime brokerage, initial margin is primarily based on counterparty credit risk - the chances of a client defaulting - rather than the risk of individual trades. "Generally what happens is someone assesses the creditworthiness, does the know your customer and anti-money laundering, sets a margin, shoves it into a system completely separate from what's going on with the actual trading floor and never touches it again for another year." says an executive at one of the largest US hedge funds.

JP Morgan is changing how it monitors risk by calculating variation margin throughout the day, a practice called real-time margining that it had begun developing even before the Archegos' spectacular collapse.

The bank previously called clients for additional margin at the start of each trading day. It is now asserting its right to demand additional margin between daily calls. If a client's positions lose value over the course of the day, JP Morgan may decide that it needs more collateral immediately.

A fund manager at the US hedge fund gives an example. "If we short something at $5 million and it appreciates to $10 million, the margin requirements would be based on that $10 million market value." he says.

JP Morgan did not lose money on Archegos, but the family office's implosion has forced banks to look again at the risks in their primer brokerage units. Other banks have taken similar steps, though some have reached different conclusions.

Credit Suisse, which had more than $10 billion of exposure to Archegos when it defaulted, relied on a 'static' margin methodology to set collateral requirements for the family office, although it had planned to introduce what it calls "dynamic margining" by the summer of this year. A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment.

Two weeks after Archegos' failure, Bank of America called a UK hedge fund manager about his single-name equity swaps. The bank said it would not make multiple margin calls in a single day even though its standard terms and conditions give it the right to ask for extra collateral in between daily scheduled meetings.

A spokesperson for Bank of America declined to comment.

Bank of America also lost no money when Archegos failed. A consultant who works with the big prime brokerage businesses says the banks' differing abilities to calculate the risks run by their clients explains why some incurred multi-billion-dollar losses while others were unscathed.

"It is a difference in capability." says the consultant. "Some banks can do all of this in an intraday system. Some of the other firms end up getting pushed around by the client. They give them the benefit of the doubt - and maybe for a little bit too long."
