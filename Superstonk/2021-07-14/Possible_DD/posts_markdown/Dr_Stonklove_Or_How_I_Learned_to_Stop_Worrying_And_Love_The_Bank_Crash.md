Hello Apes,

First off I would like to state none of this is financial advice. I am not advocating anything, but am simply sharing things that are found, and asking questions. What makes this community great is the collective hive mind in questioning everything, digging through the bullshit from the MSM, some insane level macroeconomics theory/data science, and memes. If anything I post is thought to be not accurate please share a constructive counterargument. It's important that together we come to the truth.

Additionally, given several different macroeconomic contributions, I believe a crash was going to happen with or without meme stocks. The banks are having a collateral squeeze, corporate debt is insane, margin debt is at record highs, and inflation is through the roof. Imagine you lose all your stars in the final round of Mario Party but you also shit yourself. The US economy was screwed regardless, we just found a cheat code to hedge our $$$.

I would also like to give a shout-out to [u/Horror\_Veterinar](https://www.reddit.com/u/Horror_Veterinar/) for his channel and opening up come of this wormhole. Also thanks to u/rensole for helping me post past automod

**Hypothesis**

Large hedge funds cannot be forced to close without putting Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) at risk.

**Introduction**

Now my journey started when I first saw the significant losses that banks occurred from the Archagoes Captial Management scandal. It was found that Bill Hwang used 6 different financial institutions to gather capital on margin to facilitate his trading. We all know how much of a turd sandwich that turned out to be for Creditt Suisse. As a family fund, he wasn't required to report much of his day-to-day operations. Once I realized the damage that a family fund which is a fraction of the size of Citadel Securities, I thought it was worth looking into whom they use for their financing, and ultimately would be holding the bill.

Now I'm not super fluent in legal jargon but I did come across the legal limit that Prime Brokers can extend credit up to 50.0% for margin requirements.

https://preview.redd.it/gjh304k8x6b71.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd533bf159fd9415015cefc9e0a8ba027a015ca

According to Susquehanna 2020 annual report (X17-A5), its Prime Brokers consist of Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. If Susquehanna is forced to liquidate its assets due to a Margin Call and their assets do not cover the requirement the responsibility falls onto their Prime Broker.

On our best friend Kenny's Citadel Securities 2020 annual report (X17-A5), its Prime Broker and financing activities are primarily tied to Bank of America Merril Lynch. If Citadel is unable to settle its position if it is forced to liquidate, the responsibility is on BAML to settle the position.

**Now, what is a G-SIB?**

A global systemically important bank is a bank whose systemic risk profile is deemed to be of such importance that the bank’s failure would trigger a wider financial crisis and threaten the global economy. The Basel Committee has developed a formula for determining which banks are G-Sibs, deploying criteria including size, interconnectedness, and complexity. National regulators subject banks determined to be G-Sibs to stricter prudential regulation such as higher capital requirements and extra surcharges, or more stringent stress tests.

**Its off PUTing**

As we have come to know that there is a loophole in the RegSHO where Short Hedge Funds can reset Fail To Deliver positions by holding put options. Thus it's important to look at which organizations carry the most put options. Now it is possible to simply just have put options as many analysts believe that GME/AMC is currently overvalued against their fundamentals. Just because they have put options doesn't necessarily mean you shorted GME but given the loophole and the volatility, not sure professional money managers would want to bet against GME given its recent history. Where there is smoke there's fire.

**ETF WTF?**

I also decided that it was worth looking at the ETFs that currently have the biggest exposure to GME in its index. When you check the indexes at ETF.com the **iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR)** with 3.6 Million synthetic shares and the **iShare Russel 2000 index (IWM)** with 1.37 Million synthetic shares of GME in its fund\*\*.\*\* There has been some speculation that these banks/SHFs have been significantly shorting using ETFs. I decided to see what each organization that had excessive put positions might have also had positions in the IJR and IWM index funds. As you can tell Bank of America is the Whale likely using synthetic GME shares indirectly with 35 Million shares of IJR & 34 Million of IWM.

I decided to add the iShare Russell 1000 index (IWB) due to the rebalancing the other day even if though [ETF.com](https://etf.com/) isn't updated yet with GME, due to these organizations knowing that GME would have to be placed in.

Now given that Citadel Securities most likely had 50% of its 36 Billion in assets on credit with BAML and another substantial amount tied to Susquahanna, prior to the run January squeeze. If they were sitting on that position while shorting Gme at the $4.00 mark, you can only imagine their position now. If Bank of America also had their own short position in Gamestop it is impossible for either Hedgefund to be margin called taking the bank down with it. If you read my previous DD you'd know that the previous head of equity client solutions at BofA recently was hired by Citadel. I'm sure he was very strict with risk management prior to resigning and getting his signing bonus (rolls eyes).

As shorting a stock has an infinite risk, it's mathematically possible BAML is sitting on a Trillion-Dollar shit bomb.

**Fun reply from Gamestop regarding the Crash Series**

![Fun interaction with GME about Crash , he repeatedly jumps on the up arrow \(nice\)](https://preview.redd.it/44ig3wl0x6b71.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=616fd9129994ce4e4950dad60116291a8aa0927d)

**So what now...**

I know almost everyone and their dog has been calling for the SEC to jump in to stop the criminal shorting that has occurred to our favorite Videogame retailer and movie theater. The chair of the SEC Gary Gensler knows what's going on and Gamestop is working with them, but the SEC can't force any action without putting a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) at risk yet. Any direct action against any of these organizations could cause a series of dominos to crash. With the number of securities that are being held on margin in the US financial markets, if any systemically important institution is put at risk the whole system is at risk. The whole system is propped up credit and no one actually owns anything.

**New banking reporting...**

Right now the regulators realize the banks have severely fucked up this time. The banks know the regulators know that, and the regulators know that the banks know the regulators know (yikes), but cannot prove it yet.

As of July 1st 2021, over 130 new changes/rules have been activated to the US Code Title 12. These codes are rules distinctly for Banks and Banking. These new rules are in regards to liquidity risk measurement standards, and monitoring (another shout out to Charlie's Vid's who has been actively digging through recent filings, new banking regulations, and the weird ETF wormhole).

Starting 10 business days after July 1st (or July 15th), banks are required to maintain new liquidity ratios, changes regarding risk management, they are required to disclose risk/capital, and will be more actively monitored. If they do not meet the new requirements, each banking entity is required to share what they have done to move to these new regulations, and what changes they will continue to take to become compliant. I don't particularly believe the banking system wants to disclose what they have been doing, and when I have to make a bet I usually bet on crime, and I have little faith in their self-reporting.

**Q2 Earnings Report**

[**https://investor.bankofamerica.com/regulatory-and-other-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000070858-21-000079/0000070858-21-000079.pdf**](https://investor.bankofamerica.com/regulatory-and-other-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000070858-21-000079/0000070858-21-000079.pdf)

Today is earnings report day, but despite the positive spin, they will share it's important to know that BofA is sitting on paper losses, as they have not closed their real position/loss has not been realized.

Looking at today's earnings report you can see that the #1 industry to which Bank of America has exposure to credit risk is for Asset managers and funds with just under 79 Billion in Q2 (an increase of 15.5% over Q1). I'm not entirely sure Bank of America wants to eat a \~80 Billion dollar loss from defaulting hedge fund loans, nor would they want to have to cover any additional losses from having to cover their clients' positions.

You can also see a significant increase in their liabilities for securities loaned or sold with the agreement to repurchase. In Q2 that number was 213.7 Billion in securities sold short which was up 7% in Q1, and up 19.4% year over year. Now imagine what that number might be if Gamestop was trading at its real value right now.

**Conclusion**

At this point, the banks know the jig is up. The MOASS will more likely than not happen. We know that these large Hedge funds cannot be margin-called without repercussions across the economy. The question is do the banks flush the system to shit? Can the regulator do anything? Or does an outside agent trigger it (maybe Blackrock or RC). It's possible that the plan was to crash the market all along with commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) collapsing, but no one anticipated that retail could hack the system.

There isn't much anyone in retail can really do at this point except to support the business. We know that the system is in a delicate balance and our friends at Gamestop (and maybe friends at Blackrock) hold a nuclear football with the ability to force shorts to cover and start the cascade. I don't really believe the SEC or Ryan Cohen really wants it to come down to that, but he does have that control. Don't feel bad when things turn to shit, as it's not retail's fault. The best thing you can do is educate yourself on how to preserve your wealth post-crash.

As for us, it is important to control what we can control. If you truly believe in the company support it.

**TL/DR Its entirely possible that none of these giant hedge funds can be forced to close without a crisis to a G-SIB (globally systemic important bank) like Bank of America.**

Additional Interesting Info

**What are you doing with that stock step CEO?**

If you look at a recent form 4 from recent SEC filings you will find that Brian Moynihan recently gifted 30,000 shares or $1.2 million of BAC common stock on June 16th. (Code G in this filling is Gift). Our buddy Brian also exercised some of his stock options and sold an additional 737K of BAC common stock. How does one sell more shares without raising any flags? You let someone else sell them.

**History of fraud with customers' securities** (from sec filing)

In 2016 the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Merrill Lynch has agreed to pay $415 million and admit wrongdoing to settle charges that it misused customer cash to generate profits for the firm and failed to safeguard customer securities from the claims of its creditors.

An SEC investigation found that Merrill Lynch violated the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule by misusing customer cash that rightfully should have been deposited in a reserve account.  Merrill Lynch engaged in complex options trades that lacked economic substance and artificially reduced the required deposit of customer cash in the reserve account.  The maneuver freed up billions of dollars per week from 2009 to 2012 that Merrill Lynch used to finance its own trading activities.  Had Merrill Lynch failed in the midst of these trades, the firm’s customers would have been exposed to a massive shortfall in the reserve account.

According to the SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, Merrill Lynch further violated the Customer Protection Rule by failing to adhere to requirements that fully-paid for customer securities be held in lien-free accounts and shielded from claims by third parties should a firm collapse.  From 2009 to 2015, Merrill Lynch held up to $58 billion per day of customer securities in a clearing account that was subject to a general lien by its clearing bank and held additional customer securities in accounts worldwide that similarly were subject to liens.  Had Merrill Lynch collapsed at any point, customers would have been exposed to significant risk and uncertainty of getting back their own securities.

It seems that BAML simply does not care about the rules, and will engage in extremely risky trading situations with their customer's securities. Given the risk that they are already engaged in, it is more than likely they are using their customers' shares (whether consented or not) to hold off their gigantic losses.

**Don't mess with the Zoltan**

This recent article from Bloomberg discusses how the use of the Reverse Repo market could lead to some volatility in some unusual places in the market.

As we now know cash deposits act as liabilities on Bank's balance sheets as they pay interest to their customers, and need collateral to offset this. Zoltan has been monitoring this closely. Bank of America should be literally swimming in all the new cash that has been funneled into them through the stimulus cheques. He actually states they are on the lower end post-pandemic regarding their bank reserves. Could they actually have a liquidity issue still?
