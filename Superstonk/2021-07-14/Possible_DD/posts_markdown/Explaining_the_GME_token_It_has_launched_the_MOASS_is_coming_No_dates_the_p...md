  Starting at the beginning, we originally found the [GameStop's NFT website](https://nft.gamestop.com/) which gave us the address 0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e. This is the OFFICIAL GAMESTOP TOKEN address. If you google the address, you will be shown an Etherscan link: [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e). This is the official Etherscan profile for the GME tokenized stock. Many FAKE GME tokens have been created. Be vigilant and don't believe, or spread any fake token information because this will confuse a lot of people.
  
  Inside this Etherscan profile, very smart Apes came across a (beautiful) launchDate code. You can check all of this information for yourself. On the Etherscan profile click Contract, then click Read Contract, and then open tab 5. launchDate. Opening the launchDate tab gives you a number. 1626261600 (uint256). If you convert this number to a date you will get Wednesday, July 14, 2021 11:20:00 GMT+0000. You check this yourself using [this conversion website](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/)! It'll even convert it to your time zone. This is when Apes really got excited for the NFT / Crypto-dividend to be announced on the 14th.
  
  A lot of Apes thought this date meant nothing after an employee of the NFT / Blockchain team told us that the launchDate was merely an anticipation for the new upgrade supporting the new transaction protocol EIP 1559. [This post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oh60ea/gme_nft_developler_clarifies_that_there_is_no_set/) mentions GameStop's blockchain dev replying to someone about the launchDate. The dev explicitly states the launchDate number was not for Bastille Day, nor a placeholder. Shout out to /u/daronjay for [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oh60ea/gme_nft_developler_clarifies_that_there_is_no_set/) explaining the importance of the new ETH protocol. To quote the comment directly:  
  
>The upgrade supports the new transaction protocol EIP 1559. It's possible the system GameStop are building somewhat depends on that protocol, which adds more certainty to fee pricing of transactions and smart contracts, which should lead to a much improved User Experience. It addresses one of the critical flaws in current ETH transactions, where transactions can get stalled and not complete in a timely manner if GAS fees are high, making the process more complex and uncertain and sometimes require user intervention, which has contributed to the slow mainstream adoption of ETH for ecommerce type applications.
  
  To summarize:  
>	Neither of these dates have anything specific to do with GameStop or their actual launch plans, it was to do with upgrades to the underlying protocol.
  
  So the Bastille Day theory we had running was false. The GameStop employee also dropped the date August 4th as the day EIP 1559 should be adopted, but it’s important to remember: NO DATES. Several members have pointed to the [abolition of feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_feudalism_in_France) as also being on August 4th. Finding these dates have historical importance is great and very impressive, but it’s always best to never get your hopes up too high. We shall fight everyday until SOMEONE covers. Someone has to cover. Someone will pay us. All we have to do is simple. Buy. Hold.  
  
  So where are we today? July 14th.
  The token is here. It’s live. So what are we waiting on other than EIP 1559? Let me show you [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okaqif/in_response_to_mr_hanns_retraction/) that hit Superstonk’s front page earlier. So it outlines the plan that hedge fund’s have never planned to cover and that’s still true. We took a huge hit today due to these shorts. They still aren’t covering, and it’s obvious they NEVER will cover unless forced to. It also says something very important at the end.  
  
>In June, GameStop had a paragraph talking about securities being moved within 90 days, but also, they could just move things before that. You can bet there will be some sort of activity (whether it’s in that 90 days is yet to be seen) that will make shorters close their positions and it’ll be akin to 2008 because of the US judgement lapse of allowed Citadel to have a such a prominent role in the stock market.
  
  That was a direct quote from the post, but I think the Tom Majewski got something wrong. Another user /u/International_Gold20 posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okaqif/in_response_to_mr_hanns_retraction/h572o2t/). He clarifies that the 90 day statement is completely wrong. The proxy actually doesn’t put a timeframe as to when they could move their shares to a new depository. Instead it states that if the DTCC isn’t able to handle the responsibilities of possessing GameStop’s shares for ANY reason, then GameStop will either appoint a new entity as the depository for their shares within 90 days, or else provide current shareholders with something else (possibly an NFT) that is equivalent.  
  
  I’ve been holding since January, you guys are unbelievably smart and it has been a complete joy to be here reading DD day in and out. I hope you spend your money well, work less, travel more.  
  
  As my dad once said. Buckle up.
