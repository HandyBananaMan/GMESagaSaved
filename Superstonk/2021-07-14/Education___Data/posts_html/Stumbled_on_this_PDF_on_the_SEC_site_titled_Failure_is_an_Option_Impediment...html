<p>I'm not a smart ü¶ç but I have been trying to understand the chain of responsibility between Brokers/MM/Clearing houses/DTCC. Found this in my searches, and it seems to address a lot of things we are seeing with GME. MM abuse of FTDs, oligopoly as a security becomes volatile and hard to borrow....</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf">PDF on the SEC site titled <strong>"Failure is an Option:
Impediments to Short Selling and Options Prices 
"</strong></a></p>
<p>Sound like things we are seeing with our favorite stocks right now? Anyone wrinkled want to read this over?</p>
<p>A couple of excerpts that stood out to me enough to post this here...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The popularity of failing and the price improvements it provides short sellers
encourage us to step back and consider the economic case for delivery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then we have</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the cost of failing to deliver is the cost of a zero-rebate
equity loan plus the expected incidence of buy-in costs. <strong>If this incidence is low enough,
then failing is a valuable alternative to borrowing the harder-to-borrow stocks</strong>. We show
that the alternative to fail is valuable and key to the pricing and trading of options. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can see the advantage directly in the market maker‚Äôs shorting experience.
Half the time the market maker shorts a hard-to-borrow stock, it fails to deliver at least
some of the shares. <strong>And it never accepts a negative rebate, always choosing to fail
instead.</strong> This advantage could in principle be offset by frequent buy-ins, but we find a
very low frequency of buy-ins, executed with small price concessions. How much of this advantage does the market maker share? Estimating the market
maker‚Äôs trading profits, net of rebate reductions and buy-ins, <strong>we document a significant
average profit.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh and this gem</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This favors the few highest-volume traders because, since their portfolios
turn over so much, their fails are rarely the oldest. <strong>Thus, we hypothesize that option market competition tends to oligopoly as stocks grow hard to short.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A calculation on how it costs MM next to nothing for FTD</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the buy-in trades are executed at prices 0.53% worse than
the volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the given stock on the buy-in day. The
departure from VWAP is statistically significant but even so, if we assume that the
market maker pays the same 0.53% to put the short back on, the overall expected buy-in
cost is (0.12%)(2)(0.53%), or 0.1bp. <strong>So the expected buy-in cost is, for our market
maker at least, vanishingly small.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they REALLY focus on how clearing houses has unique ways of handling "special securities" (GME anyone)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We hypothesize that the clearing corporation handles fails in a way that
favors higher-volume market makers, resulting in weaker competition when stocks grow
special.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh boy, and it looks like bigger MMs have to buy-in A FUCK TON less than the average:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we can see directly that <strong>our data supplier experiences an abnormally low
incidence of buy-ins on its fails</strong>. On the average day, across the 502 sample trading days,
this large market maker is failing on 4.4M shares. This is about 1.75% of the ~250M
fails on all NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ stocks on the average day, in Boni (2005) (see
Figure 1 of that paper). In Table II we see that our market maker experienced 86 buy-ins
across the 502 days, or <strong>about 1/6 buy-in per day</strong>. If this is about 1.75% of buy-ins, we
should see about 10 buy-ins per day. But the DTCC reports more than 4,300 buy-in
notices per day, and the fraction of notices that result in buy-ins is presumably greater
than 1/430. <strong>Thus, our data provider‚Äôs fails appear relatively unlikely, compared to other
traders‚Äô fails, to beget buy-ins.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>We show that the option to fail is significant to both the trading and pricing of equity
options. <strong>We show that it is often in-the-money, and that when it is, market makers profit
and so do their customers</strong></p>

<p>Can I get a Silverback in here to help wrinkle my brain on this?</p>
