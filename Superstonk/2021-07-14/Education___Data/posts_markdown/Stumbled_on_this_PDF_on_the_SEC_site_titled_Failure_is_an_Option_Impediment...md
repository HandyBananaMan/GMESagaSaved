I'm not a smart 🦍 but I have been trying to understand the chain of responsibility between Brokers/MM/Clearing houses/DTCC. Found this in my searches, and it seems to address a lot of things we are seeing with GME. MM abuse of FTDs, oligopoly as a security becomes volatile and hard to borrow....

[PDF on the SEC site titled **"Failure is an Option:
Impediments to Short Selling and Options Prices 
"**](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf)

Sound like things we are seeing with our favorite stocks right now? Anyone wrinkled want to read this over?

A couple of excerpts that stood out to me enough to post this here...

> The popularity of failing and the price improvements it provides short sellers
encourage us to step back and consider the economic case for delivery

then we have

> Thus, the cost of failing to deliver is the cost of a zero-rebate
equity loan plus the expected incidence of buy-in costs. **If this incidence is low enough,
then failing is a valuable alternative to borrowing the harder-to-borrow stocks**. We show
that the alternative to fail is valuable and key to the pricing and trading of options. 

and 

> We can see the advantage directly in the market maker’s shorting experience.
Half the time the market maker shorts a hard-to-borrow stock, it fails to deliver at least
some of the shares. **And it never accepts a negative rebate, always choosing to fail
instead.** This advantage could in principle be offset by frequent buy-ins, but we find a
very low frequency of buy-ins, executed with small price concessions. How much of this advantage does the market maker share? Estimating the market
maker’s trading profits, net of rebate reductions and buy-ins, **we document a significant
average profit.**

oh and this gem

> This favors the few highest-volume traders because, since their portfolios
turn over so much, their fails are rarely the oldest. **Thus, we hypothesize that option market competition tends to oligopoly as stocks grow hard to short.** 

A calculation on how it costs MM next to nothing for FTD

> that the buy-in trades are executed at prices 0.53% worse than
the volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the given stock on the buy-in day. The
departure from VWAP is statistically significant but even so, if we assume that the
market maker pays the same 0.53% to put the short back on, the overall expected buy-in
cost is (0.12%)(2)(0.53%), or 0.1bp. **So the expected buy-in cost is, for our market
maker at least, vanishingly small.** 

And they REALLY focus on how clearing houses has unique ways of handling "special securities" (GME anyone)

> **We hypothesize that the clearing corporation handles fails in a way that
favors higher-volume market makers, resulting in weaker competition when stocks grow
special.**

oh boy, and it looks like bigger MMs have to buy-in A FUCK TON less than the average:

>Finally, we can see directly that **our data supplier experiences an abnormally low
incidence of buy-ins on its fails**. On the average day, across the 502 sample trading days,
this large market maker is failing on 4.4M shares. This is about 1.75% of the ~250M
fails on all NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ stocks on the average day, in Boni (2005) (see
Figure 1 of that paper). In Table II we see that our market maker experienced 86 buy-ins
across the 502 days, or **about 1/6 buy-in per day**. If this is about 1.75% of buy-ins, we
should see about 10 buy-ins per day. But the DTCC reports more than 4,300 buy-in
notices per day, and the fraction of notices that result in buy-ins is presumably greater
than 1/430. **Thus, our data provider’s fails appear relatively unlikely, compared to other
traders’ fails, to beget buy-ins.** 

**CONCLUSION**

> IV. Conclusion

> We show that the option to fail is significant to both the trading and pricing of equity
options. **We show that it is often in-the-money, and that when it is, market makers profit
and so do their customers**


Can I get a Silverback in here to help wrinkle my brain on this?
