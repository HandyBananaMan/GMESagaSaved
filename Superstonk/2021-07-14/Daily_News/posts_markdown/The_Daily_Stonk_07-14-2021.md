# Now the SEC won't let me be so they passed new rules yesterday and lets go see.

Yesterday the CFTC had a meeting and we got a couple of new rules!

Also our own  u/leisure_rules  made a post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ojmur0/extended_summary_cftc_risk_meeting_and_proposals/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

also it seems that the DTC dropped a lot of rules about options yesterday... someone is prepping themselves for something ðŸ¤”

Also before we go just remember, Today is t+35 days from June 9th, the shareholder meeting.

May be something, may be nothing but I'm playing "row row fight the powa" on full blast today with high hopes.

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
