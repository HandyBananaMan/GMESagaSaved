Hi there! I don't have expertise with TA, graphs or rectal bananas (why would I need to say that?), but I do have experience with corporate legal matters.

I posted DD on why we should expect the votes to be underreported ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5k6ql/psa\_voting\_will\_be\_underreported/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5k6ql/psa_voting_will_be_underreported/)), what happens if there is over-voting ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mya2a8/dd\_heres\_what\_happens\_if\_there\_is\_over\_voting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mya2a8/dd_heres_what_happens_if_there_is_over_voting/)) and why would they say that a majority of shares were represented at the meeting ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvzwou/important\_this\_is\_why\_they\_mentioned\_more\_than\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvzwou/important_this_is_why_they_mentioned_more_than_a/))

# Now I'm putting out an update, because THE VOTES ARE IN!

Here is a link to the 8-k as filed with the SEC: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521186759/d174340d8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521186759/d174340d8k.htm).

According to this 8-k filing, there were **55,541,279 votes** recorded as votes cast or broker non-votes at the meeting.

\--------- READ THE WHOLE THING BEFORE YOU COME TO ANY CONCLUSIONS --------------------

**What does this mean?**

This means that Computershare provided a final report to GameStop stating that, after tabulating the votes (***including correcting any over-voting***), there were 55,541,279 votes cast at the meeting.

As of the record date, there were 70,771,778 shares of common stock that were issued, outstanding and entitled to vote.

This means that 78.48% of the shares eligible to vote were counted as having voted.

**What does this not mean?**

This does NOT mean that only 78.48% of the shares eligible to vote actually voted. Wait what? Read it again if you have to. It is possible (and I would say highly likely) that potentially many more votes were cast than are reflected in the above numbers. Now reconsider why you are surprised - Dr. T mentioned it in her interview, Wes Christian mentioned it in his interview, heck even I mentioned it in my own posts.

*The votes were under-reported.*

Why? How?

1. If brokers realize they will vote on behalf of more shares than they have registered at DTCC (i.e. because those shares are the product of naked shorting), then ***those brokers can correct their vote before it ever gets to Broadridge or Computershare.***
2. If brokers submit their votes to Broadridge and pay for a special service from Broadridge, Broadridge provides them notice that they are voting for more shares than they have registered at DTCC, so that ***those brokers can correct their vote before it ever gets to Computershare.***
3. If shareholders holding shares through a broker did not vote their shares, then those shares may not be counted at all (not even as a non-vote). For example, Broker A has 10 clients holding 10 GME shares each, but only 60 GME shares registered at DTCC (because 40 GME shares are the product of naked shorting). 6 clients vote their shares. Broker A reports 60 GME shares voted and does not need to correct their vote - ***even though they have clients holding 40 GME shares that haven't voted. Computershare would not know of those 40 GME shares.***
4. Computershare receives the votes from Broadridge (which may have already been pre-reconciled by the broker itself or post-reconciled with Broadridge's assistance) and notices that there are more shares than should be voted. Computershare provides this information to GameStop.
   1. In Computershare's notes, they see that certain institutions have not exercised their voting rights - say, just as a hypothetical, BlackRock with 9,217,335 shares or Vanguard Group with 5,162,095 shares meaning that there are 14,379,430 shares that Computershare knows cannot be reflected in the voting results. So now Computershare is expecting votes for the remaining shareholders (or remaining 56.4 million shares - not actually that far off from the actual shares voted number).
   2. Computershare starts comparing the votes they've received with the DTCC records and notices that Brokers C, D, E, F and G actually hold a combined 10 million shares in the registered records of DTCC, but they cast votes for 20 million shares (note that item 3 above could still apply). Then Computershare needs to correct the vote for each individual broker to reduce it to the number of shares properly issued, because GME only ever issued 70,771,778 shares. This is not fraudulent on Computershare's behalf, this is necessary because **there cannot be more shares that the company records as having voted than actual shares that the company issued!**

Remember - eToro mentioned that 63% of its clients voted. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvy8u7/63\_of\_all\_gme\_shares\_on\_etoro\_have\_been\_voted/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nvy8u7/63_of_all_gme_shares_on_etoro_have_been_voted/) This means that if eToro had a DTCC position of 63 shares and each client voted one share, then it would appear to Computershare that there was no over-voting, even though 37 shares would be left unaccounted for.

So here are 5 different ways that the votes can be under-reported.

Do I think that the GME shareholders only cast votes for 55.5 million shares? No. I think that many more votes were cast.

# Here are some myths I've seen floating around.

MYTH: THE COMPANY NEEDS TO TELL US EXACTLY HOW MANY VOTES WERE COUNTED IMMEDIATELY!

Incorrect. They reported the voting results as provided to them by Computershare. They may have evidence of over-voting. Like Wes Christian discussed, this can be used as part of their strategy against the SHFs. I've discussed how I might use that information, but I am not sitting at the board room table with all of the information that they have. It appears clear that the SEC is investigating matters relating to trading GME shares, which must include the shorting of GME shares, so GME also needs to be very prudent and tactical as to how they address this matter.

This type of scenario requires precision and wisdom, not a sledgehammer, in order to properly navigate the minefield of a war against SHFs, while transforming a legacy company into an e-commerce giant including the massive amount of changes at the executive level (which is so incredibly challenging and time consuming to create a new culture and team at the highest levels - ***hats off to you, RC and your team***).

They might announce over-voting. They might not. They will act in the best interests of the shareholders for the long-term benefit of the company. If you are looking for a short squeeze at any cost, then the Board might favour the interests of their shareholders long-term over what you would like to see happen - and they would be right to do so.

MYTH: THE INSIDERS CAN'T VOTE, THIS IS JUST THE FLOAT - THERE ACTUALLY WAS OVER-VOTING RECORDED?!?!

The float does not have anything to do with number of shares available to vote. I'm not sure where the thought came from that insiders can't vote. There are restricted shares that haven't been issued to insiders, those can't be voted, because they haven't been issued. Rest assured, the insiders who actually hold shares have the same right to vote as any other shareholder (subject to conflict of interest rules for special resolutions relating to those specific insiders, but that is not relevant here).

As per the proxy statement, there were "70,771,778 shares of common stock that were issued, outstanding and entitled to vote". ***There is no reason to believe that only the float could vote - the company clearly states that almost 70.8 million shares were eligible to vote.***

MYTH: TOO MANY VOTES WOULD INVALIDATE THE MEETING. THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAPPENED MEANS THERE WAS NOT OVER-VOTING!

That's not correct. ***Too many votes would not make the meeting invalid***. In fact, the Delaware law even contemplates that there might be over voting for public companies that is corrected by the inspector of elections. (![https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc07/index.html](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc07/index.html), section 231(d)). However, it is necessary for the inspector of elections to correct the vote so that in the final voting results you do not record more shares voted than actually issued, because then the company's books would be fraudulent and that just doesn't work.

MYTH: THIS MUST MEAN THE SHORTS HAVE COVERED.

Did you read any of the above? The number of shares actually voted was significant! If you take into account the many ways that the votes could be under-reported and corrected, this should not shake your prior belief as to whether the shorts covered or not. I am not concerned and I put out posts in advance warning about this hoping to arm apes with knowledge to protect against the FUD.

You have to realize that - as with everything - we will not have concrete answers. This system has been successfully running fraudulent shorting schemes for a long time and we need to be comfortable walking in the unknown. Because we will not have certainty. The moment we have certainty is after the squeeze has squoze. Until then, I've done my due diligence, I like the stock, I like the company and I've grown kinda fond of you apes too.

I don't think the shorts have covered, not at all.

MYTH: IF THEY CORRECTED THE VOTE, THEN THE TOTAL SHARES VOTED WOULD HAVE BEEN 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES. SINCE ONLY 55 MILLION SHARES VOTED, THERE CANNOT HAVE BEEN THIS CORRECTION!

This is a great question and I completely understand the line of thinking to come to this conclusion. ***However, when votes are corrected, that is done on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and not to the aggregate votes cast.*** So if there are shareholders on Computershare's list holding 15 million shares that Computershare knows have not voted (and they have not advised Computershare that they have granted a proxy to another party to vote their shares), then **Computershare must not include those shares in the count**. This is why there can be the correction of over-voting without the end voting result being 100% of all of the issued and outstanding shares represented in the vote.

This is set out under the corporate law of Delaware ![https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc07/index.html](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc07/index.html) (Sect 231).

"In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with those proxies, any information provided in accordance with § 211(e) or § 212(c)(2) of this title, or any information provided pursuant to § 211(a)(2)b.(i) or (iii) of this title, ballots and the regular books and records of the corporation, **except that the inspectors may consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons** ***which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record***."

This requires any correction by the inspector of elections to be completed on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis - where a shareholder is voting more shares than such shareholder is entitled to vote on - rather than just correcting all votes across the board to drop the total number to 100%.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR - the votes were under-reported due to a number of factors, this does not mean the shorts have covered. For me, I will continue to buy (do I even have any money left?) and hodl.

**And of course this is only counting shares as at April 15, 2021. I believe that many more shares have been purchased by apes since then.**

If there's anything I missed, let me know and I'll see if I can add it in. Hope this helps.

To the moon, apes.

EDIT 1: Added some additional detail for clarity.

EDIT 2: u/Galzra34 posted a comment that Larry Cheng's votes were counted as 55,541,280 rather than the 55,541,279 votes reported for all other matters. That could support the position that Computershare corrected the votes on a pro-rata basis and this difference is a result of rounding differences. It could also be a typo, but typically this would be calculated electronically in a way that you wouldn't have a typo (but you could have a rounding discrepancy that isn't manually caught and corrected).
