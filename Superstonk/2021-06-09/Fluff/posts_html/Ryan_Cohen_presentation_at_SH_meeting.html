<p>...we've ushered in a whole new era at Gamestop.</p>
<p>On a personal note I'm humbled to be elected to your board and serve as your chairman.  We have a lot of work in front of us and it will take time.  We're trying to do something to do something that no one in the retail space has ever done but we believe we are putting the right pieces in place and have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the long term.  The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times.</p>
<p>We know some people want us to layout a whole detailed plan today, but that's not going to happen.  You won't find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition; that is the philosophy we adopted at Chewy.</p>
<p>Here are a few things we've done so far: refreshed the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthen the balance sheet, and we begun laying the foundation for long term growth.  Moving forward we want you to judge Gamestop based on our action, not our words.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say, "Buckle up".</p>
