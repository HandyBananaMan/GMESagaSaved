<p><strong>TLDR: 662% Short Interest based on share dilution. Mayo-Man FUK’D, $GME to ANDROMEDA</strong></p>
<p>Ok Apes, let’s see if this gets buried at the bottom of a stack of memes and videos of dudes drinking socks and putting bananas places, or if it actually gives out some wrinkles. So how about we start with, why should I spend time reading shit from this dude doing the typing and the numbers and using symbols and squiggly lines next to numbers? Well, I donno wtf I’m talking about and I’m not some fancy schmancy financial advisor I’ve just studied a bunch of math shit in university and I like Adderall, caffeine, and snorting red crayons, well, at least I think they’re red crayons, I’m colorblind so I just snort all of them and tell myself they’re red. I’ve done a couple DDs and have spent most of my time delving deeply into the dark pools, but that shits been hit to death and we all know dark pools are dirty af and shouldn’t be a thing, but I digress.</p>
<p>So I read a post a couple weeks ago by u/ammoprofit that got buried, probably because he included “Math” in the title, who wants to read about math when we can look at buildings with lights on, right?! So while I was reading through this Ape’s post I got an extra wrinkle or two and starting thinking in terms of dilution with regard to our favorite stonk. So to start with simple, share dilution is what happens when you naked short or short without covering a security. Think of it this way, GME has 70m shares outstanding, you short the stock to the tune of 10m shares and don't cover those shares, there are now 80m shares outstanding, however the market capitalization does not change, therefore the security has now been synthetically diluted with an extra 10m shares (which is the incredibly crooked part of shorting a stock, you short it because shorting is a derivative product of the stock, so you’re betting on the stock decreasing in value. However you are in effect diluting the security so it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy because anyone that has traded in pennystocks knows dilution = decrease in value and therefore decrease in price per share. Shit should be illegal, and it’s no wonder these wallstreet cucks are laughing all the way to the bank printing counterfeit shares without a care in the world. It's OK, I have a feeling that shits gonna change REAL soon).</p>
<p>So now you know what dilution is, why does it matter now?</p>
<p>So we have now experienced 3 flash crashes: January, March, June. January was a unique flash crash, because the “buy” button on the majority of retail traders’ brokers got turned off, so it was a flash crash with minimal possibility of buying pressure being applied to the volume. For March we are going to apply the general principle that during a flash crash including multiple circuit breaker halts, there will be minimal buying pressure due to the selling pressure and many traders holding out to see where the bottom is before buying more. The flash crash yesterday was more controlled, stopping the crash within $0.20 of initiating a trading halt almost as if it was completely algorithm and HFT driven (looking at you Kenny!) before trading sideways for a few minutes and finishing the crash. These 3 flash crashes likely (as if there is any other possibility since we diamond handed apes aren't selling shit!) used extensive short shares to drive the price down.</p>
<p>Assumptions</p>
<p>Without more in depth data, I had to make several assumptions to apply toward my data so here are the highlights of those assumptions:</p>
<p>·  Shares outstanding are 70,772,000 (Source: Fidelity)</p>
<p>·  Short Interest Reported 12/28/2020 is the last semi-accurate number at: 71,196,206 (source: <a href="https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts">https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts</a>)</p>
<p>·  The SI above I have to assume  is accurate without more definitive data, even though we all know it was VERY likely highly under-reported despite its already astronomical percentage of the available float</p>
<p>·  My volume measurements were taken on 5 minute candles during the 3 crashes, and as such I am eliminating from consideration: buying pressure on the way down, and legitimate sales from paper-handed bitches, though legitimate shares would carry the same weight in this instance as a share sold short</p>
<p>·  Δ = Change in value</p>
<p>So I took the data I have access to and built a small Excel spreadsheet to run a few calculations based on the volume data and ΔPrice. I didn’t take the time to make any graphs or even to format and make the spreadsheet look pretty, so all the data is just basically tossed in there in a way that makes sense to my autist brain. To anyone wondering why the volumes are listed in decimals, it was easier for me to run the numbers more quickly that way, idk why, just throw an E6 on there (multiply by 1,000,000). The volume levels are also, like I said before, added up on 5 minute candles from the start of the flash crash to the bottom. Depending on which broker’s chart you’re looking at it could change by a small amount, but the 3 websites/brokers (Fidelity ATP, Webull, TradingView) I ran through all had fairly similar numbers so I stuck with these. </p>

<p>What does this have to do with dilution? I’m getting there, hang with me for another minute and I’ll have some rough estimates that’ll give ya a fat fuckin chub, I promise!</p>
<p>So let’s go through the data real quick:</p>
<p>·  January: It required a volume of 11,570,840 to drop the price by $370.60</p>
<p>·  March: It required a volume of 7,858,790 to drop the price by $176.50</p>
<p>·  June: It required a volume of 2,796,480 to drop the price by $63.66</p>
<p>So just looking at these numbers it doesn’t tell us a whole lot because all we have is a number of shares and a price, there is no commonality in them that would allow a good comparison, so let’s simplify those numbers and figure out how many shares it required to drop the price by $1 each flash crash.</p>
<p>·  January: 31,221.91 shares dropped the price by $1</p>
<p>·  March: 44,525.72 shares dropped the price by $1</p>
<p>·  June: 43,928.37 shares dropped the price by $1</p>
<p>Now those are some pretty numbers with a commonality: number of shares per $1 drop. Looking at this, there is a large disparity between January and March as well as January and June. However comparing March and June the numbers are pretty damn close (June is 98% of March, so a very small difference between the rate of the two). </p>
<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong>:</p>
<p>What has changed between right fucking now and March? Much to Mayo-boys dismay, we have spent the last 6 months learning a hell of a lot more than we knew in January, and I would wager since the Second Great Ape Migration to r/SuperStonk we have continued that process of learning and have far more wrinkles now than we did in March. So what’s the hypothesis? In March many of us were knew investors and were not veterans of the great pennystock stop-loss raids. Those of us who knew or had ever experienced a stop-loss raid knew the number one rule when HODLing a stonk: DO NOT SET STOP LOSSES. My hypothesis here is a fair amount of the March flash crash were stop-losses being triggered. I cannot confirm the number of stop losses vs. shares short, so since the ratio in March and June is very similar, we are just going to use the numbers for June moving forward from here since I would wager very few of us still had stop losses set yesterday (If you still have them set, remove that shit or you’ll miss the rocket, I guarantee it *cue Men’s Warehouse old dude*) </p>
<p>I am going to use the January and June flash crashes for the rest of this data, and while I’m sure many stop losses were triggered in January, and robbinghood did some fuckery with force-closing positions for those on margin, cuz it’s all we’ve got. I’ve waited to do this DD to analyze a third flash crash, and while none of these was perfect (except I would put my money on yesterday’s flash crash providing the best numbers simply because we have all forged our hands deep within the pressure of FUD and shills and MSM bullshit and they are all now solid diamonds so there were few legitimate sales of long shares). </p>
<p>Comparing the January and June flash crash, June required an additional 140% of shares sold to decrease the price by $1 (compare 43,928 to 31,221). The Reported short interest for GME on 12/28/2020 was 71,196,206 (Ortex, see above). The following data is speculation, and it’s assuming those short did not cover a significant portion of the short interest prior to the Jan flash crash. Any percentage I put from here on is also the short percentage of the total outstanding shares. There has been a lot of talk as to the exact number of the available float from back in Jan (most assumed it was 50m, GameStop in their annual report put it at 26m then sold 3.5m shares which would make it 29.5m now, but that part doesn’t matter so much at this particular juncture).</p>
<p>So the definition of Short Interest (not to be confused with short volume, that shit drove me crazy when people would use the term interchangeably back on r/GME) is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp</a>).</p>
<p>Back to dilution. Remember the example I gave back in the beginning of this dissertation with the 10m shares short interest on a 70m outstanding security leaving 80m shares on the market? So let’s apply that example here to our favorite stonk. Shares outstanding is 70,772,000 and Short Interest was 71,196,206 reported. Add those two together and you get a diluted share count of 141,968,206 shares on the market.</p>
<p>Let’s take that one step further. We know the flash crash that occurred yesterday took 140% of additional shares to drop the price each $1, which one could infer means GME has been further diluted since January. </p>
<p>Remember: Dilution reduces the “power” of each share sold short because it dilutes the security and synthetically reduces the value of each individual share per the market capitalization. To make that simpler: Each share holds a percentage of the value of the market capitalization, if previously it took 1 share to equal 1 banana, now it takes 5 shares to equal 1 banana, therefore you have to put 5 shares of the banana on the market for sale in order to reduce the bushel by 1 banana due to the banana being diluted.</p>
<p>So we went through how in January there were 141,968,206 shares oustanding, and now due to the diluted power of each individual share sold in June to the tune of 140%, it is reasonable to assume there are approximately 199,745,362 shares outstanding with dilution considered. Let’s take that another step and consider that number compared to the available float, that way we can REALLY see how incredibly fukd Mr. Mayo and his buddies are.</p>
<p>The given Total Outstanding Shares is 70,772,000. Let’s take that and Subtract out all of the institutions and insiders listed in GME’s Official Proxy Statement (<a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/8f795a88-54a3-4320-b3e2-a2d5f28be6c4">https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/8f795a88-54a3-4320-b3e2-a2d5f28be6c4</a>)</p>

<p>So according to GME’s proxy, there are 44,107,423 shares held by insiders and institutions, which leaves a float of 26,664,577 shares. Accounting for the ATM offering of 3.5m shares, we have a final float of 30,164,577 shares.</p>
<p>So how deeply and truly fucked is mayo man? Well, using our dilution calculations and combining that with just the outstanding shares, we get a diluted value of 282% of the total outstanding shares on the market right now. Now don’t throw anything at me because that number is less than what you were hoping, remember, this is a percentage of the TOTAL OUTSTANDING shares, NOT the float. We do the calculation for the float, and Kenny-boy might turn into a scene from South Park just from reading the number. Wait, who am I kidding, Mayo man knows EXACTLY how very, incredibly fucked he is. </p>
<p>Looking at the diluted value and comparing it to the available float, and we get 662.19% Holy good god damn, the boys at Goldman are probably shitting their pants looking at Kenny’s exposure and how he has not only fucked himself in trying to win the bankruptcy jackpot, but he has fucked everyone above and below and to the side and under his desk (give you a hint, its mayo, dude probably has a vat of mayo hidden under his desk). </p>
<p>Well hope this gave out a few new wrinkles. Yes, I know the calculations are not exact and don’t perfectly account for the short exposure Shitadel and friends are sitting on, but it’s as far as estimations go, seems pretty legit to me, but who the fuck am I, I just put numbers in spreadsheets and snort crayons.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to check my work or has more wrinkles and wants to throw some more data and make pretty charts and shit with my data, lemme know. Or if I’m completely off base and retarded as Kenny is fucked, then post up why and I’ll edit and correct.</p>
<p>Hedgies are fucked worse than bananas in u/Rick_of_Spades kitchen. <strong>Diamond FUCKING Hands.</strong></p>
