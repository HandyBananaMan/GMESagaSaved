<p>Disclaimer: I'm more of an art ape than an analysis, this is not financial advice I am not a financial adviser just a guy who thinks Susquehanna rhymes with SquashedBanana and that makes my ape brain happy. here's ken riding his last flash crash to oblivion. Now on with the (potential) DD!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Citadel, Susquehanna, and the other large funds that are short $GME have been strategically creating a psychological trojan horse. They have been fighting to keep the price below 350 to keeps the smaller short hedge funds from getting margin called so they can sacrifice them after tomorrows meeting (or soon after) let the price rise to near its actual limit (around 485 - 500) and then throw literally every last attack at $GME creating a similar-looking pattern to January... however this will be their final hail marry and If we HODL, Then moon!</strong></p>
<p>I was going over Atobitt's post earlier today  "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nv6nmj/whats_happening_today_682021/">What's happening today - 6/8/2021</a> " when something he wrote caught my eye. To quote u/Atobitt:</p>
<p><em>"Think back to the House of Cards - Part III. Remember the example I gave of Goldman Sachs when they were being "bought in"? What did they do? They shorted</em> <strong><em>EVEN MORE</em></strong> <em>than they purchased on that day to keep the price down. As I am writing this, it is literally happening with GME.  I honestly do not believe this is retail selling, but rather, a flash-crash to drive the price down. "</em></p>
<p>He went on to say:</p>
<p><em>"This is not normal behavior and is HIGHLY unlikely that retail is responsible. Prepare for EXTREME volatility and know that these actions are performed to prevent OTHER BROKER-DEALERS from being margin called."</em></p>
<p>Let me repeat that last part:**"These actions are performed to prevent OTHER BROKER-DEALERS from being margin called! "**those last words formed one hell of a wrinkle in my brain, I began pouring over the charts and came up with a theory!</p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk about $350 they keep shoving it below that price, I theorize that is because that is the price the smaller funds get margin called, Shitadel and SquashBannana are <strong>ONLY</strong> keeping them afloat to use as sacrificial pawns in their endgame.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (or soon after) The large Short hedge funds will let the price rise, close to where it peaked in January, the small funds will be forced to cover at $350 we will see the Short interest drop a lil. It will look like shorts are covering because they are! just the baby ones think a hand full of Glacial capitals or something along those lines, sacrificial lambs for the slaughter.</p>
<p>As the price rises near or past 485 (Januarys peak) we will get the big boy, the final hail mary, the <strong>MOAFC</strong> (Mother Of All Flash Crashes). Citadel and the remaining larger short hedge funds will hit with EVERYTHING they got left, they want it to look like the final squeeze happened.</p>
<p>This will without a doubt be followed by MSM saying it's over, the remaining shorts covered, FUD beyond all FUD, Motlyfool will forget about game stop so hard they'll get dementia, etc.</p>
<p>When the dust clears Citadel's ammo will be spent, and when ken looks out from under his desk he will see that we still <strong>HODL. ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ</strong> It will be all over for the short hedgies (<em>hopefully</em>) and the MOASS will begin.This sums up my theory on how the rest of the week/ next week will turn out, It's gonna be one hell of a bumpy ride to the moon, but it will be worth it. Love you all, it's been a hell of a journey so far and we're still only on the launch pad.</p>
<p>Mod's if you see this and deem me worthy in all my smoothbrainedness, PLEASE, can I get a yellow tag that reads "SquashedBannana" ty love u!</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Huckleberry_007 mentioned this.</strong> <strong><em>"Interactive broker CEO already said it was going to go to thousands, and we know they didn't cover. Probably shouldn't have let that out of the bag back then lol."</em></strong><strong>Completely slipped my mind but yeah, it's legit possible that the big SHF's could let this baby ride into the thousands before they drop the mother of all flash crashes. either way, I got my floor and I ain't selling till then. Buy,Hold,Vote!</strong></p>
