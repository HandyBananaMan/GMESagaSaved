    "selftext": "**TLDR: 662% Short Interest based on share dilution. Mayo-Man FUK\u2019D, $GME to ANDROMEDA**\n\nOk Apes, let\u2019s see if this gets buried at the bottom of a stack of memes and videos of dudes drinking socks and putting bananas places, or if it actually gives out some wrinkles. So how about we start with, why should I spend time reading shit from this dude doing the typing and the numbers and using symbols and squiggly lines next to numbers? Well, I donno wtf I\u2019m talking about and I\u2019m not some fancy schmancy financial advisor I\u2019ve just studied a bunch of math shit in university and I like Adderall, caffeine, and snorting red crayons, well, at least I think they\u2019re red crayons, I\u2019m colorblind so I just snort all of them and tell myself they\u2019re red. I\u2019ve done a couple DDs and have spent most of my time delving deeply into the dark pools, but that shits been hit to death and we all know dark pools are dirty af and shouldn\u2019t be a thing, but I digress.\n\nSo I read a post a couple weeks ago by u/ammoprofit that got buried, probably because he included \u201cMath\u201d in the title, who wants to read about math when we can look at buildings with lights on, right?! So while I was reading through this Ape\u2019s post I got an extra wrinkle or two and starting thinking in terms of dilution with regard to our favorite stonk. So to start with simple, share dilution is what happens when you naked short or short without covering a security. Think of it this way, GME has 70m shares outstanding, you short the stock to the tune of 10m shares and don't cover those shares, there are now 80m shares outstanding, however the market capitalization does not change, therefore the security has now been synthetically diluted with an extra 10m shares (which is the incredibly crooked part of shorting a stock, you short it because shorting is a derivative product of the stock, so you\u2019re betting on the stock decreasing in value. However you are in effect diluting the security so it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy because anyone that has traded in pennystocks knows dilution = decrease in value and therefore decrease in price per share. Shit should be illegal, and it\u2019s no wonder these wallstreet cucks are laughing all the way to the bank printing counterfeit shares without a care in the world. It's OK, I have a feeling that shits gonna change REAL soon).\n\nSo now you know what dilution is, why does it matter now?\n\nSo we have now experienced 3 flash crashes: January, March, June. January was a unique flash crash, because the \u201cbuy\u201d button on the majority of retail traders\u2019 brokers got turned off, so it was a flash crash with minimal possibility of buying pressure being applied to the volume. For March we are going to apply the general principle that during a flash crash including multiple circuit breaker halts, there will be minimal buying pressure due to the selling pressure and many traders holding out to see where the bottom is before buying more. The flash crash yesterday was more controlled, stopping the crash within $0.20 of initiating a trading halt almost as if it was completely algorithm and HFT driven (looking at you Kenny!) before trading sideways for a few minutes and finishing the crash. These 3 flash crashes likely (as if there is any other possibility since we diamond handed apes aren't selling shit!) used extensive short shares to drive the price down.\n\nAssumptions\n\nWithout more in depth data, I had to make several assumptions to apply toward my data so here are the highlights of those assumptions:\n\n\u00b7  Shares outstanding are 70,772,000 (Source: Fidelity)\n\n\u00b7  Short Interest Reported 12/28/2020 is the last semi-accurate number at: 71,196,206 (source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts))\n\n\u00b7  The SI above I have to assume  is accurate without more definitive data, even though we all know it was VERY likely highly under-reported despite its already astronomical percentage of the available float\n\n\u00b7  My volume measurements were taken on 5 minute candles during the 3 crashes, and as such I am eliminating from consideration: buying pressure on the way down, and legitimate sales from paper-handed bitches, though legitimate shares would carry the same weight in this instance as a share sold short\n\n\u00b7  \u0394 = Change in value\n\nSo I took the data I have access to and built a small Excel spreadsheet to run a few calculations based on the volume data and \u0394Price. I didn\u2019t take the time to make any graphs or even to format and make the spreadsheet look pretty, so all the data is just basically tossed in there in a way that makes sense to my autist brain. To anyone wondering why the volumes are listed in decimals, it was easier for me to run the numbers more quickly that way, idk why, just throw an E6 on there (multiply by 1,000,000). The volume levels are also, like I said before, added up on 5 minute candles from the start of the flash crash to the bottom. Depending on which broker\u2019s chart you\u2019re looking at it could change by a small amount, but the 3 websites/brokers (Fidelity ATP, Webull, TradingView) I ran through all had fairly similar numbers so I stuck with these. \n\n[Data and calculations based on volumes and price change during each of 3 flash crashes](https://preview.redd.it/2tl0r4y9u7471.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9079b389c7a9779b0bbad4aadf72b2a7a603794)\n\nWhat does this have to do with dilution? I\u2019m getting there, hang with me for another minute and I\u2019ll have some rough estimates that\u2019ll give ya a fat fuckin chub, I promise!\n\nSo let\u2019s go through the data real quick:\n\n\u00b7  January: It required a volume of 11,570,840 to drop the price by $370.60\n\n\u00b7  March: It required a volume of 7,858,790 to drop the price by $176.50\n\n\u00b7  June: It required a volume of 2,796,480 to drop the price by $63.66\n\nSo just looking at these numbers it doesn\u2019t tell us a whole lot because all we have is a number of shares and a price, there is no commonality in them that would allow a good comparison, so let\u2019s simplify those numbers and figure out how many shares it required to drop the price by $1 each flash crash.\n\n\u00b7  January: 31,221.91 shares dropped the price by $1\n\n\u00b7  March: 44,525.72 shares dropped the price by $1\n\n\u00b7  June: 43,928.37 shares dropped the price by $1\n\nNow those are some pretty numbers with a commonality: number of shares per $1 drop. Looking at this, there is a large disparity between January and March as well as January and June. However comparing March and June the numbers are pretty damn close (June is 98% of March, so a very small difference between the rate of the two). \n\n**HYPOTHESIS**:\n\nWhat has changed between right fucking now and March? Much to Mayo-boys dismay, we have spent the last 6 months learning a hell of a lot more than we knew in January, and I would wager since the Second Great Ape Migration to r/SuperStonk we have continued that process of learning and have far more wrinkles now than we did in March. So what\u2019s the hypothesis? In March many of us were knew investors and were not veterans of the great pennystock stop-loss raids. Those of us who knew or had ever experienced a stop-loss raid knew the number one rule when HODLing a stonk: DO NOT SET STOP LOSSES. My hypothesis here is a fair amount of the March flash crash were stop-losses being triggered. I cannot confirm the number of stop losses vs. shares short, so since the ratio in March and June is very similar, we are just going to use the numbers for June moving forward from here since I would wager very few of us still had stop losses set yesterday (If you still have them set, remove that shit or you\u2019ll miss the rocket, I guarantee it \\*cue Men\u2019s Warehouse old dude\\*) \n\nI am going to use the January and June flash crashes for the rest of this data, and while I\u2019m sure many stop losses were triggered in January, and robbinghood did some fuckery with force-closing positions for those on margin, cuz it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve waited to do this DD to analyze a third flash crash, and while none of these was perfect (except I would put my money on yesterday\u2019s flash crash providing the best numbers simply because we have all forged our hands deep within the pressure of FUD and shills and MSM bullshit and they are all now solid diamonds so there were few legitimate sales of long shares). \n\nComparing the January and June flash crash, June required an additional 140% of shares sold to decrease the price by $1 (compare 43,928 to 31,221). The Reported short interest for GME on 12/28/2020 was 71,196,206 (Ortex, see above). The following data is speculation, and it\u2019s assuming those short did not cover a significant portion of the short interest prior to the Jan flash crash. Any percentage I put from here on is also the short percentage of the total outstanding shares. There has been a lot of talk as to the exact number of the available float from back in Jan (most assumed it was 50m, GameStop in their annual report put it at 26m then sold 3.5m shares which would make it 29.5m now, but that part doesn\u2019t matter so much at this particular juncture).\n\nSo the definition of Short Interest (not to be confused with short volume, that shit drove me crazy when people would use the term interchangeably back on r/GME) is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)).\n\nBack to dilution. Remember the example I gave back in the beginning of this dissertation with the 10m shares short interest on a 70m outstanding security leaving 80m shares on the market? So let\u2019s apply that example here to our favorite stonk. Shares outstanding is 70,772,000 and Short Interest was 71,196,206 reported. Add those two together and you get a diluted share count of 141,968,206 shares on the market.\n\nLet\u2019s take that one step further. We know the flash crash that occurred yesterday took 140% of additional shares to drop the price each $1, which one could infer means GME has been further diluted since January. \n\nRemember: Dilution reduces the \u201cpower\u201d of each share sold short because it dilutes the security and synthetically reduces the value of each individual share per the market capitalization. To make that simpler: Each share holds a percentage of the value of the market capitalization, if previously it took 1 share to equal 1 banana, now it takes 5 shares to equal 1 banana, therefore you have to put 5 shares of the banana on the market for sale in order to reduce the bushel by 1 banana due to the banana being diluted.\n\nSo we went through how in January there were 141,968,206 shares oustanding, and now due to the diluted power of each individual share sold in June to the tune of 140%, it is reasonable to assume there are approximately 199,745,362 shares outstanding with dilution considered. Let\u2019s take that another step and consider that number compared to the available float, that way we can REALLY see how incredibly fukd Mr. Mayo and his buddies are.\n\nThe given Total Outstanding Shares is 70,772,000. Let\u2019s take that and Subtract out all of the institutions and insiders listed in GME\u2019s Official Proxy Statement ([https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/8f795a88-54a3-4320-b3e2-a2d5f28be6c4](https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/8f795a88-54a3-4320-b3e2-a2d5f28be6c4))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Beneficial ownership of shares taken from GME Proxy Statement](https://preview.redd.it/o4er8q0gu7471.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=611e3781916c18bb39f5301f87c7dd66e2f05a0c)\n\nSo according to GME\u2019s proxy, there are 44,107,423 shares held by insiders and institutions, which leaves a float of 26,664,577 shares. Accounting for the ATM offering of 3.5m shares, we have a final float of 30,164,577 shares.\n\nSo how deeply and truly fucked is mayo man? Well, using our dilution calculations and combining that with just the outstanding shares, we get a diluted value of 282% of the total outstanding shares on the market right now. Now don\u2019t throw anything at me because that number is less than what you were hoping, remember, this is a percentage of the TOTAL OUTSTANDING shares, NOT the float. We do the calculation for the float, and Kenny-boy might turn into a scene from South Park just from reading the number. Wait, who am I kidding, Mayo man knows EXACTLY how very, incredibly fucked he is. \n\nLooking at the diluted value and comparing it to the available float, and we get 662.19% Holy good god damn, the boys at Goldman are probably shitting their pants looking at Kenny\u2019s exposure and how he has not only fucked himself in trying to win the bankruptcy jackpot, but he has fucked everyone above and below and to the side and under his desk (give you a hint, its mayo, dude probably has a vat of mayo hidden under his desk). \n\nWell hope this gave out a few new wrinkles. Yes, I know the calculations are not exact and don\u2019t perfectly account for the short exposure Shitadel and friends are sitting on, but it\u2019s as far as estimations go, seems pretty legit to me, but who the fuck am I, I just put numbers in spreadsheets and snort crayons.\n\nIf anyone wants to check my work or has more wrinkles and wants to throw some more data and make pretty charts and shit with my data, lemme know. Or if I\u2019m completely off base and retarded as Kenny is fucked, then post up why and I\u2019ll edit and correct.\n\nHedgies are fucked worse than bananas in u/Rick_of_Spades kitchen. **Diamond FUCKING Hands.**",
