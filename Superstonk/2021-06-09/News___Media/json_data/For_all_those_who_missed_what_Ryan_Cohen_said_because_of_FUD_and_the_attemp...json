On a personal note, I want you to know I\u2019m humbled to be elected to your board and serve as your Chairman.\u00a0We have a lot of work in front of us, and it will take time.\nWe\u2019re trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done\u00a0but we believe we\u2019re putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the longterm. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on\nthese goals at all times.\nWe know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today,\u00a0but that\u2019s not gonna happen.\u00a0You won\u2019t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition. That\u2019s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy.\nHere are a few things we\u2019ve done so far:\u00a0refresh the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth.\nMoving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions,\u00a0not our words.\u00a0Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say, \u201cbuckle up.\u201d[https://gmedd.com/transformation/ryan-cohen-at-agm-we-ushered-in-a-whole-new-era-of-gamestop/](https://gmedd.com/transformation/ryan-cohen-at-agm-we-ushered-in-a-whole-new-era-of-gamestop/)",
