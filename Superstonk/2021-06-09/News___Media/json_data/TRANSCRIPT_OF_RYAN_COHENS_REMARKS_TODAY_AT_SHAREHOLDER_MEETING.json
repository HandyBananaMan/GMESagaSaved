We\u2019re fortunate to have such a special group of investors holding the company\u2019s shares. You guys inspire us to think bigger, fight harder and work longer each day. You\u2019ve ushered in a whole new era at GameStop. On a personal note, I want you to know I'm humbled to be elected to YOUR board to be YOUR chairman. We have a lot of work in front of us and it will take time.**   \n\n\n>**We are trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done, but we believe we are putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers, and driving shareholder value for the long term. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times.**   \n\n\n>\t**We know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today, but that\u2019s not gonna happen. You won\u2019t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition; that\u2019s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy. Here are a few things we\u2019ve done so far: refreshed the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth.** \n  \n\n>\t**Moving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions, not our words. Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say: buckle up.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/redchessqueen99 u/pinkcatsonacid u/atobitt u/bye_triangle u/sharkbaitlol\n\nEdit for rocket emojis:\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1a\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1d",
