    "selftext": "Now call me a tin-foiled hat conspiracy theorist butttt after reading about the normalised votes it just hit me.\n\nRyan Cohen is literally saying not to judge them by their words, aka the votes, if they have been normalised (which seems to be the case) he literally told us to not judge them by that.\n\nJudge them by their actions, well the main action that we\u2019ve seen today is GME working alongside the SEC. I know it\u2019s a relatively common phrase but we alllllll know how RC loves to be cryptic. \n\nAlso did anyone else find it odd that George Sherman basically gave us a nod in the ER. \u201cA group of very dedicated and enthusiastic investors\u201d that\u2019s clearly not aimed at the average shareholder, that\u2019s the Apes. \n\nRegardless my Tits are jacked and my balls are buckled up. It\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride.",
