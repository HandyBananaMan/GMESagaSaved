Who gives a flying fuck that we did not recieve the actual vote total and we may never know the actual amount voted.\n\nGamestop had a fabulous day and you should be excited about the company's future. About month or so ago, everyone was having wet dreams about the day that gamestop would get a badass ceo. Well here he is and he is about to transform the company.\n\nIt is still highly likely that retail owns over the float. It is just a waiting game now. Citadel is a drowning fly in a glass of water and they can't get out.\n\nBe patient and buckle up \ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: We are also on an exponential floor. Most apes at this point shouldn't worry about dips because you won't lose anything before the squeeze. It's just profits at this point\n\nEdit 2: the vote fud needs to stop. With the sheer number of people voted plus the amount of apes on here who were on brokers that did not allow them to vote plus the normies not on reddit who also bought shares; It's hard to argue that we do not own the float. Everyone needs to chill with the vote count",
