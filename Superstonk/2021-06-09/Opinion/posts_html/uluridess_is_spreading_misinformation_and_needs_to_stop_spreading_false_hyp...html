<p>Majority means &gt;50% .. this is standard, of course they were going to say this.</p>
<p>Wait 4 days for DeLoitte to do the audit, GameStop will then file the vote count with the SEC and then we will know.</p>
<p>Wait for the 8-K .. it's this simple. Everything else is FUD &amp; speculation.</p>
<p>This is disappointing coming from a moderator.</p>
<p>EDIT 1 - The stream had over 20k viewers, it's disappointing that emotions cannot be kept in check and information be vetted before it is splashed all over the stream.</p>
<p>All we heard for 15 minutes was u/luridess's opinion, which was completely misguided.</p>
<p>Frankly, it was embarrassing. The community works so hard to build solid DD's, check each others work, and this is the example we're given by moderators ?</p>
<p>EDIT 2 - Does this even need words... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SicgRYTmk&amp;t=4320s&amp;ab_channel=Superstonk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SicgRYTmk&amp;t=4320s&amp;ab_channel=Superstonk</a></p>
