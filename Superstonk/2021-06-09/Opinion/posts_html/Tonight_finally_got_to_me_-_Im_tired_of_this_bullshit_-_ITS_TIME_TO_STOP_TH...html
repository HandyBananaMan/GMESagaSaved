<p>It's not about the price. I don't care about the price. I'm holding till the back ass of the MOASS, but guys and gals, I'm tired.</p>
<p>I know we've all been holding for months now, and what happened tonight wasn't anything new, but to see the same desperate moves over and over again, and like clockwork, the shill media emerge from their swamp with another round of lies and paid propaganda...</p>
<p>I'll admit, tonight it hit me hard. </p>
<p><strong><em>I don't want to live in a world where this bullshit is allowed to continue.</em></strong></p>
<p>How many more companies must we sacrifice to these lying, cheating bastards? Tens of thousands of good companies subjected to thirty or forty years of this <strong><em>bullshit</em></strong>. </p>
<p><strong><em>Not one of those companies</em></strong> had an incredible band of apes save their ass and take them to the moon. </p>
<p><strong><em>Nobody</em></strong> came for those countless, nameless, hopeful entrepreneurs who took a chance on themselves and their idea, founded their company against all odds, only to get callously shorted into the dirt on some fucking billionaire's whim.</p>
<p>Their entrepreneurial spirit <strong><em>crushed</em></strong>. Their families and friends who believed and invested in them, <strong><em>stomped out</em></strong>. Collective dreams, <strong><em>shattered</em></strong>. Future prospects for a better world that you and I could have lived in, <strong><em>denied</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Just so a cabal of obscenely rich elites could add another couple million to their vast hoard of unearned wealth.</p>
<p>It's deeply fucked up and abhorrent.</p>
<p>I want to see these people go to jail for the rest of their lives for what they've done. For what they continue to do unashamedly, even with the eyes of the world now on them, and the law biting at their heels.</p>
<p>Yet they continue their blatant criminal operation -  <strong><em>because they know they're untouchable.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>That has to change.</strong></p>
<p>Dearest apes I implore you. After the MOASS,  lets never let up on these fuckers.</p>
<p>When we look down from the moon with all the dirty money we've taken from them, lets remember to finish the fucking job and wipe these greedy fucks off the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong><em>If we can pool our money to clean oceans, we can damn sure build a giant money cannon and aim it at this entire fucking corrupt system.</em></strong></p>
