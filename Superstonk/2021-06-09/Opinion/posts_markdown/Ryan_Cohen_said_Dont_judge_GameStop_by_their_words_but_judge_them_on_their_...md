Now call me a tin-foiled hat conspiracy theorist butttt after reading about the normalised votes it just hit me.

Ryan Cohen is literally saying not to judge them by their words, aka the votes, if they have been normalised (which seems to be the case) he literally told us to not judge them by that.

Judge them by their actions, well the main action that we’ve seen today is GME working alongside the SEC. I know it’s a relatively common phrase but we alllllll know how RC loves to be cryptic. 

Also did anyone else find it odd that George Sherman basically gave us a nod in the ER. “A group of very dedicated and enthusiastic investors” that’s clearly not aimed at the average shareholder, that’s the Apes. 

Regardless my Tits are jacked and my balls are buckled up. It’s going to be one hell of a ride.
