Majority means >50% .. this is standard, of course they were going to say this.

Wait 4 days for DeLoitte to do the audit, GameStop will then file the vote count with the SEC and then we will know.

Wait for the 8-K .. it's this simple. Everything else is FUD & speculation.

This is disappointing coming from a moderator.

EDIT 1 - The stream had over 20k viewers, it's disappointing that emotions cannot be kept in check and information be vetted before it is splashed all over the stream.

All we heard for 15 minutes was u/luridess's opinion, which was completely misguided.

Frankly, it was embarrassing. The community works so hard to build solid DD's, check each others work, and this is the example we're given by moderators ?

EDIT 2 - Does this even need words... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SicgRYTmk&t=4320s&ab\_channel=Superstonk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SicgRYTmk&t=4320s&ab_channel=Superstonk)
