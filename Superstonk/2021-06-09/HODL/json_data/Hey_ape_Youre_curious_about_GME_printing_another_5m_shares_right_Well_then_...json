    "selftext": "TL;DR Gamestop announced they have an option to print 5 million shares. Find the link in the other hundred threads about this. I'll just provide some other information.\n\nThey are giving themselves the **option** of selling 5 million shares to raise capital, should it be needed. It is currently not needed.\n\nThis is standard for any public company, since the option must publicly be announced to investors. It happens during practically every annual general meeting, and is a fail-safe put in place to avoid unforeseen financial catastrophe, or allow for a specific business strategy. It does not mean things will happen now, or tomorrow. It just means the option is available.",
