<p>TL;DR Gamestop announced they have an option to print 5 million shares. Find the link in the other hundred threads about this. I'll just provide some other information.</p>
<p>They are giving themselves the <strong>option</strong> of selling 5 million shares to raise capital, should it be needed. It is currently not needed.</p>
<p>This is standard for any public company, since the option must publicly be announced to investors. It happens during practically every annual general meeting, and is a fail-safe put in place to avoid unforeseen financial catastrophe, or allow for a specific business strategy. It does not mean things will happen now, or tomorrow. It just means the option is available.</p>
