I've been with them for 15 years and never once received a call from them to just \"Check in\".   They have never once called to ask how I was doing when I was losing money by the thousands learning how to day trade.  They didn't give a shit when I tanked an sizable account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I have a good sized position in GME and now that the numbers are up, they are seeing how I'm doing and did I need anything?   lol.   Never heard from them EVER until now.  Lol.  Not mad just interesting that they picked now to reach out to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust saying.....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Just wanted to put this here as I'm reading the Balance sheets and waiting for the meeting.  They are really improving the bottom line btw.  Hedgies were always going to attack the stock even if the results were amazing.  They need the price to be lower and I can't wait to buy this dip.  :) \n\n# \" Net Sales Grew 25% to $1.3 Billion\n\n***Appoints Technology Veterans Matt Furlong (CEO) {Former Amazon} and Mike Recupero (CFO) {Former Amazon CFO}\"***\n\n[**3sc01**](https://www.reddit.com/user/3sc01/)**OP**\u00b7[19m](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw55do/new_ceo_and_cfo_from_amazon_bullishh/h172qkw/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\ud83e\udd8d Buckle Up \ud83d\ude80\n\nMatt Furlong, Veteran E-Commerce Leader and Technology Industry Executive, Appointed CEO Mike Recupero, Seasoned Technology Industry Finance Executive, Appointed CFO GRAPEVINE, Texas, June 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp.
