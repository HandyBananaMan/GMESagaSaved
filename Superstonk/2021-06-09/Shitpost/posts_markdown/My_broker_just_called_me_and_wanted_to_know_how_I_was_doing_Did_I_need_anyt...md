# Title: My broker just called me and wanted to know how I was doing? Did I need anything and thank me for being a customer. He admitted he looked at my account. I jokingly said, you are just checking in with me because you know I'm about to be rich. His mmhmm chuckle said it all, I'm bullish as fuck!

![How I'm feeling after that call....](https://preview.redd.it/5juvpfcrha471.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cb153f2139227e3ecc0b9c82f24aeeeb362469e)

I'm just throwing it out there.   I've been with them for 15 years and never once received a call from them to just "Check in".   They have never once called to ask how I was doing when I was losing money by the thousands learning how to day trade.  They didn't give a shit when I tanked an sizable account.

Now I have a good sized position in GME and now that the numbers are up, they are seeing how I'm doing and did I need anything?   lol.   Never heard from them EVER until now.  Lol.  Not mad just interesting that they picked now to reach out to me.

Edit:  Just wanted to put this here as I'm reading the Balance sheets and waiting for the meeting.  They are really improving the bottom line btw.  Hedgies were always going to attack the stock even if the results were amazing.  They need the price to be lower and I can't wait to buy this dip.  :)
