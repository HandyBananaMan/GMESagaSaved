The mod team and SATORI squad have received a fantastic amount of love, support, and gratitude for sweeping up the shills, fixing ModMail, providing valuable insights, and otherwise doing our part to keep Superstonk as wonderful as ever. Fan mail, fan art, even a [serenade to our beloved algo-rilla.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrgu4e/i_sing_satori_a_song/)\n\nThe appreciation is very much appreciated, but our work is never truly done. More so than ever, the responsibility to maintain a legendary sub rests in the hands of ordinary Apes.\n\n[Satori Dev 2021 Colourized ](https://preview.redd.it/pl2ongc36a471.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f8eefbaa05393ea3fa9c425e024687ee361871b)\n\nThe shills are *absolutely furious* about what we've been up to the past week. It's as if they [need this allegedly-impossible creation of ours shut down post-haste](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrx4pu/onslaught_of_antisatori_fud_gives_me_hope/) \\- desperation is in the air, and it tells me everything I need to know.\n\nAs the informatics arms-race between SATORI and its adversaries heats up, I'd like to make everyone aware of emerging stratagems and what they mean for the Ape community, so we're all well-equipped to deal with anything thrown at us ahead of time.\n\n**Solicitations, trolling & phishing in DMs**\n\nThis tactic is as old as FUD itself, but it hasn\u2019t been this prevalent in months - the working theory is that the impostors suddenly have a load of accounts unable to post lying around, and wish to make use of them somehow. So, if you get any suspicious messages pushing \"investment advice\" or similar, **please report these to Reddit and our mod team.**\n\nA lot of these are Meltdown trolls that thrive on the attention, so I wouldn't recommend engaging or 'putting them on blast' - but if you insist, our friends from [r/scambait](https://www.reddit.com/r/scambait/) have plenty of advice on the matter.\n\n**Bad karma**\n\nSince the restrictions, Apes whose accounts barely make it above the karma limit have [found themselves under attack by bots downvoting all their submissions, pulling them back below the threshold.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsij2i/are_bots_and_shills_down_voting_apes_below_the/)\n\nThink about it - if professional FUD-mongers can't spread FUD directly, the second-worst thing they can do is attack solid content to prevent it from being seen. These attacks are exactly why we set SATORI to run in reverse and approve Apes, as well as using it to gather data on new tricks.\n\nWe're currently in discussions regarding what else can be done to prevent or counter such surreptitious acts; suggestions accepted. For the time being, it's up to everyone to be active in upvoting the good, downvoting the bad, and reporting the *really* bad. Not only does this help a clear sub - it also lets us learn about the shills and strike back more effectively.\n\nAs with $GME as a stock, every vote matters.\n\n**Leveraging Apes and the weekend ennui**\n\nOn Saturday, a lot of us woke up to a *flood* of posts relating to a comment by a particular CNBC reporter. Sharing new info is a wonderful thing, but in this case, it was a deluge of the same content being repeated over and over again. As you can imagine, I was getting a ton of pings asking to sic the Terminators on these guys.\n\nSo, where was SATORI?\n\nAs [Bradduck explained in his ambassadorship comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nplhx7/game_stop/h05v5ec?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Interdiction Day, our setup is currently running on a per-user basis; a bit of negative sentiment doesn't necessarily make a shill. We've all woken up on the wrong side of bed, and one comment isn't enough for anyone to form an accurate verdict - whether they're an algorilla or a carbon-based, 100% organic, dip-buying ape.\n\nWe know that our adversaries are aware of this, and how they're countering it - their only hope at this point is to rely on otherwise well-behaved users to post content that dilutes or otherwise lowers the overall quality of the sub. That, and outright *stealing* accounts with AI approval or Superstonk posting histories in broad daylight - more on that later.\n\nTheir attempts to drag down karma on Apes' accounts reveal that they're just as interested in preventing top-tier submissions from gaining traction as they are indirectly posting their own tosh. So, now that they're mostly unable to bring their own stuff into Superstonk, they're relying on us to do their work for them.\n\nI took the liberty of checking the Melissa posters' accounts, and it turns out the vast majority of them were genuine Apes with solid and lengthy histories in Superstonk. No wonder our per-user security measures didn't bag 'em, they aren't supposed to.\n\nIt's the weekend, there aren't any crayons to watch and everyone's understandably miffed. But please, if you believe the meme/tracker/DFV tweet or similar you're about to submit may have been posted before, I implore you to **check before posting.**\n\nThe Superstonk jungle - especially the [Knights of New](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nti5ms/knights_of_new/) \\- will appreciate it dearly.\n\n**Tag teams**\n\nStruck with a sudden shortage of useable accounts, our adversaries have had to pick their battles a bit more wisely - as opposed to regurgitating the same thing over and over, getting banned, migrating to a new account et cetera. One way to accomplish this is by tag-teaming - setting up a wedge of sorts and sowing drama on both sides.\n\n[Here's a brief yet insightful comment covering this tactic, and how to deal with it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsmutv/complacency_kills_dont_let_satori_lull_you_into_a/h0nk71l?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n**Hacked accounts & a final note on account security**\n\nWe have received a surge in reports of Superstonk users\u2019 accounts getting compromised It would appear that accounts able to post (i.e. approved by SATORI or above the karma/age requirements) are more likely to be targeted, but this could happen to anyone - don\u2019t get complacent.\n\nPlease refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nojpde/best_security_practices_for_protecting_self_and/) for a comprehensive rundown on account security, in addition to other useful advice on the matter. Also, a friendly reminder not to click any [suspicious links.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n\n[ NO hax for you Kenny ](https://preview.redd.it/awilw5m96a471.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b932464d13bfb0760ac89ea49b11f8e0419c9b89)\n\nTA;DR\n\nWhile the sub is significantly cleaner than it used to be, SATORI still has a long way to go. Since deployment, we've seen a trend towards attacks that don't rely on publicly 'revealing' their accounts. The might of 375,000+ AI-assisted gorillas is just too much.\n\nInstead of the old hit-and-run spamming, our foes are resorting to sneakier methods: hacking accounts, manipulating karma, sliding into people's DMs, and otherwise causing trouble outside the public eye. In addition, they're increasingly relying on genuine Apes to accidentally drown out the good stuff, being increasingly unable to bring it into the sub themselves.\n\nThis scenario leaves far more responsibility to individual Apes than what we had before, so it is up to each and every one of us to deal with it appropriately.\n\nA sub is only as strong as its weakest link - B.H.V.F., and be strong.\n\nCatto======================================================\n\nAlso from the Satori Team: \n\n[Important Security Update for June 8th](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nva7nh/satori_the_one_week_security_update_important/)\n\n[u/Grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/Grungromp/) \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80Help Wanted\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\n\n**If you have any interest in assisting with the Summary/ Transcriptions check out this post from** u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore**:** [**Superstonk Seeking Volunteers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw3s9m/superstonk_seeking_volunteers_ama_transcription/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# LAST MINUTE BREAKING NEWS \n\n[CEO AND CFO ANNOUCEMENT](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-appointments-chief-executive-officer-and) \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**\ud83d\udea8 Reddit down \ud83d\udea8**\n\nWith Reddit having issues during high traffic, exciting moments in this saga, we have discussed what to do if Reddit has an outage.\n\n**IF REDDIT GOES DOWN AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT A LARGE PORTION OF THE MOD TEAM IS ON TWITTER.**\n\n[https://twitter.com/ByeTriangle](https://twitter.com/ByeTriangle)\n\n[https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid](https://twitter.com/PinkCatsOnAcid)\n\n[https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99](https://twitter.com/RedChessQueen99)\n\n[https://twitter.com/rensole](https://twitter.com/rensole)\n\n[https://twitter.com/u\\_sharkbaitlol](https://twitter.com/u_sharkbaitlol)\n\n[https://twitter.com/BradduckF](https://twitter.com/BradduckF)\n\n**IF THERE IS SOMETHING BIG GOING ON WHILE THE OUTAGE IS HAPPENING WE MAY ALSO UTILIZE THE \"EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM\" TO RELAY INFO:**\n\n[SuperstonkLive YouTube - Emergency Broadcast System](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4EET9NJPWxUuXGlG6fxPA)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n ***OOK OOK***\n\n***\"I may have been early, but I am not wrong\"***\n\n[\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d](https://preview.redd.it/l6h28q8ds8471.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b27c837a1b1f0e047e3822ee74f63e94e3e5566e)",
