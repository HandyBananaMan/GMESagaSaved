<p>Pink is on the road at the moment, she was lucky enough to go to Grapevine for the Shareholders meeting. I offered to step in and handle The Jungle Beat, one less thing to worry about!  I hope you don't mind me subbing in for now!</p>

<p><strong>SHAREHOLDERS MEETING</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>"As my dad would say, Buckle-up"</em></strong> Ryan Cohen, 🪑 of GameStop</p>
<h1>🚀</h1>
<p>This is how they adjourned the meeting. Absolutely legendary. We had a crazy amount of Apes watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4SicgRYTmk">Superstock live coverage</a>... 30k at the peak. The stream had a bit of turbulence, but I think all things considered it was a great time. Something to make the day a little more hype!</p>
<p>Huge Thank you to the anchorman himself, u/Rensole, also u/Atobitt, and u/Luridess for hopping in on such short notice. The stream kind of made it feel like we all got to enjoy the meeting together. Certainly made <em>me</em> feel better about not being able to go. </p>

<p>📞<strong>Earnings Call</strong> 📞 </p>
<p>^((My second favorite type of call 👀))</p>
<p>Saved my seat in the earnings call early, last time it was full REALLY quick! I am expecting really great earnings this quarter. We have seen tons of apes supporting their investment by shopping at GameStop. Also, some youtube dude bought out a whole stores of all their merchandise... oh-- wait no I think he did it <em>3 times.</em> Pretty weird concept for a youtube video but hey, whatever 🤷‍♂️ I am down. I can only imagine that will have at least a mild impact overall. </p>
<p>I guess for now we wait and see. Maybe some After-Hours Market action is in store? Who know</p>

<p><strong>👻🤖Ghost in the Shill 🤖👻</strong></p>
<p><em>written by SATORI co-creator</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/">u/catto_del_fatto</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqnora/satori_the_first_36_hours/">Oh yeah, it's all coming together</a>. The mod team and SATORI squad have received a fantastic amount of love, support, and gratitude for sweeping up the shills, fixing ModMail, providing valuable insights, and otherwise doing our part to keep Superstonk as wonderful as ever. Fan mail, fan art, even a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrgu4e/i_sing_satori_a_song/">serenade to our beloved algo-rilla.</a></p>
<p>The appreciation is very much appreciated, but our work is never truly done. More so than ever, the responsibility to maintain a legendary sub rests in the hands of ordinary Apes.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/pl2ongc36a471.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8eefbaa05393ea3fa9c425e024687ee361871b">Satori Dev 2021 Colourized </a></p>
<p>The shills are <em>absolutely furious</em> about what we've been up to the past week. It's as if they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrx4pu/onslaught_of_antisatori_fud_gives_me_hope/">need this allegedly-impossible creation of ours shut down post-haste</a> - desperation is in the air, and it tells me everything I need to know.</p>
<p>As the informatics arms-race between SATORI and its adversaries heats up, I'd like to make everyone aware of emerging stratagems and what they mean for the Ape community, so we're all well-equipped to deal with anything thrown at us ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>Solicitations, trolling &amp; phishing in DMs</strong></p>
<p>This tactic is as old as FUD itself, but it hasn’t been this prevalent in months - the working theory is that the impostors suddenly have a load of accounts unable to post lying around, and wish to make use of them somehow. So, if you get any suspicious messages pushing "investment advice" or similar, <strong>please report these to Reddit and our mod team.</strong></p>
<p>A lot of these are Meltdown trolls that thrive on the attention, so I wouldn't recommend engaging or 'putting them on blast' - but if you insist, our friends from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/scambait/">r/scambait</a> have plenty of advice on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>Bad karma</strong></p>
<p>Since the restrictions, Apes whose accounts barely make it above the karma limit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsij2i/are_bots_and_shills_down_voting_apes_below_the/">found themselves under attack by bots downvoting all their submissions, pulling them back below the threshold.</a></p>
<p>Think about it - if professional FUD-mongers can't spread FUD directly, the second-worst thing they can do is attack solid content to prevent it from being seen. These attacks are exactly why we set SATORI to run in reverse and approve Apes, as well as using it to gather data on new tricks.</p>
<p>We're currently in discussions regarding what else can be done to prevent or counter such surreptitious acts; suggestions accepted. For the time being, it's up to everyone to be active in upvoting the good, downvoting the bad, and reporting the <em>really</em> bad. Not only does this help a clear sub - it also lets us learn about the shills and strike back more effectively.</p>
<p>As with $GME as a stock, every vote matters.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Apes and the weekend ennui</strong></p>
<p>On Saturday, a lot of us woke up to a <em>flood</em> of posts relating to a comment by a particular CNBC reporter. Sharing new info is a wonderful thing, but in this case, it was a deluge of the same content being repeated over and over again. As you can imagine, I was getting a ton of pings asking to sic the Terminators on these guys.</p>
<p>So, where was SATORI?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nplhx7/game_stop/h05v5ec?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Bradduck explained in his ambassadorship comment</a> on Interdiction Day, our setup is currently running on a per-user basis; a bit of negative sentiment doesn't necessarily make a shill. We've all woken up on the wrong side of bed, and one comment isn't enough for anyone to form an accurate verdict - whether they're an algorilla or a carbon-based, 100% organic, dip-buying ape.</p>
<p>We know that our adversaries are aware of this, and how they're countering it - their only hope at this point is to rely on otherwise well-behaved users to post content that dilutes or otherwise lowers the overall quality of the sub. That, and outright <em>stealing</em> accounts with AI approval or Superstonk posting histories in broad daylight - more on that later.</p>
<p>Their attempts to drag down karma on Apes' accounts reveal that they're just as interested in preventing top-tier submissions from gaining traction as they are indirectly posting their own tosh. So, now that they're mostly unable to bring their own stuff into Superstonk, they're relying on us to do their work for them.</p>
<p>I took the liberty of checking the Melissa posters' accounts, and it turns out the vast majority of them were genuine Apes with solid and lengthy histories in Superstonk. No wonder our per-user security measures didn't bag 'em, they aren't supposed to.</p>
<p>It's the weekend, there aren't any crayons to watch and everyone's understandably miffed. But please, if you believe the meme/tracker/DFV tweet or similar you're about to submit may have been posted before, I implore you to <strong>check before posting.</strong></p>
<p>The Superstonk jungle - especially the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nti5ms/knights_of_new/">Knights of New</a> - will appreciate it dearly.</p>
<p><strong>Tag teams</strong></p>
<p>Struck with a sudden shortage of useable accounts, our adversaries have had to pick their battles a bit more wisely - as opposed to regurgitating the same thing over and over, getting banned, migrating to a new account et cetera. One way to accomplish this is by tag-teaming - setting up a wedge of sorts and sowing drama on both sides.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsmutv/complacency_kills_dont_let_satori_lull_you_into_a/h0nk71l?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Here's a brief yet insightful comment covering this tactic, and how to deal with it.</a></p>
<p><strong>Hacked accounts &amp; a final note on account security</strong></p>
<p>We have received a surge in reports of Superstonk users’ accounts getting compromised It would appear that accounts able to post (i.e. approved by SATORI or above the karma/age requirements) are more likely to be targeted, but this could happen to anyone - don’t get complacent.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nojpde/best_security_practices_for_protecting_self_and/">this post</a> for a comprehensive rundown on account security, in addition to other useful advice on the matter. Also, a friendly reminder not to click any <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">suspicious links.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/awilw5m96a471.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b932464d13bfb0760ac89ea49b11f8e0419c9b89"> NO hax for you Kenny </a></p>
<p>TA;DR</p>
<p>While the sub is significantly cleaner than it used to be, SATORI still has a long way to go. Since deployment, we've seen a trend towards attacks that don't rely on publicly 'revealing' their accounts. The might of 375,000+ AI-assisted gorillas is just too much.</p>
<p>Instead of the old hit-and-run spamming, our foes are resorting to sneakier methods: hacking accounts, manipulating karma, sliding into people's DMs, and otherwise causing trouble outside the public eye. In addition, they're increasingly relying on genuine Apes to accidentally drown out the good stuff, being increasingly unable to bring it into the sub themselves.</p>
<p>This scenario leaves far more responsibility to individual Apes than what we had before, so it is up to each and every one of us to deal with it appropriately.</p>
<p>A sub is only as strong as its weakest link - B.H.V.F., and be strong.</p>
