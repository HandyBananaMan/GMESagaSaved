However, several apes have made the trip to the meeting and we have apes on the scene to give on-location commentary and immediate feedback on the events of the meeting.\n\nThe meeting starts at 11:00 a.m. Eastern (10:00 a.m. Central) and lasts for 15 minutes.\n\n**SCHEDULE**\n\n10 a.m. EDT / 9 a.m. CT / 2:00 p.m. UTC - Live Pre-Meeting Commentary\n\n11 a.m. EDT / 10 a.m. CT / 3:00 p.m. UTC - Shareholder Meeting Live Coverage\n\n11:30 a.m. EDT / 10:30 a.m. CT / 3:30 p.m. UTC - Live Post-Meeting Commentary\n\n12:00 p.m. EDT / 11:00 a.m. CT / 4:00 p.m. UTC - Additional Commentary and Discussion\n\n4:20 p.m. EDT / 3:20 p.m. CT / 8:20 p.m. UTC - [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) Live Monkey Business Premiere\n\n5:00 p.m. EDT / 4:00 p.m. CT / 9:00 p.m. UTC - Q1 2021 Gamestop Corp. Earnings Conference Call\n\n# Monkey Business Premiere\n\n[Yea, if you could #ookookook that'd be great.](https://preview.redd.it/670wahvcd7471.png?width=4001&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee76cf78466c0fb9a7fa55bc9e99dd1086a0b29b)\n\n**\ud83d\udc8e** [**WATCH HERE**](https://youtu.be/UDKC_oXqhGM)**\ud83d\udc8e live @ 4:20 p.m. Eastern (3:20 p.m. Central, 8:20 p.m. UTC)**\n\nJoin the ape community for a panel discussion about the current events of the stock trading world, and especially topics pertaining to the events of the day. Today's session will be hosted by u/jsmar18 and u/sharkbaitlol with various apes in a panel format.\n\nPlease note that Monkey Business is a brand new concept and we are still figuring out its exact programming structure. However, we hope to be discussing GameStop stock history, NFTs, FTDs, Naked Shorts, and more!\n\nThis panel will from one and a half to two hours, or longer if needed. We also plan to discuss the Q1 2021 earnings conference call in this meeting. For more information:\n\n[**Q1 2021 Gamestop Corp. Earnings Conference Call**](https://investor.gamestop.com/events/event-details/q1-2021-gamestop-corp-earnings-conference-call) **at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central)**\n\n# Power to the Players, but please behave...\n\n[Monke do a business.](https://preview.redd.it/1qvyj7glf7471.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1893de62025e22dc7cf28cb5ef67e22fc2213b9c)\n\nPlease, for the love of DFV, represent us responsibly if you are attending this meeting. Retail investors receive enough flack from the mainstream media without adding pranksters at shareholder meetings to the list. Please dress appropriately and be respectful of everyone there.\n\nWe would like to err on the side of caution that IRL shills may attend and attempt to make us look bad, pretending to be part of this community when they are not. Typical, right? If you see anyone who seems to be intentionally sabotaging the ape image at this meeting, please take the necessary steps. That may range from speaking up against the individual, or reporting to security.\n\nThat said, I am insanely proud to be a part of this community. The fact that we have a team of individuals agreeing to run live streams and share this experience with the rest of us is truly heartwarming. I love this community with all of my heart and you all never cease to amaze me.\n\nNow, let's go! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n[Art by u\\/YoungbloodAA](https://preview.redd.it/i707ol57g7471.jpg?width=3840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1e8195f1f18bda5bd4f67c0689af98db96ce8a1)\n\nEdit: \n\nHey everyone. I think there's a misconception. \ru/PinkCatsOnAcid\r mentioned that CNBC was trying to talk to HER and I relayed it to the live stream, and they misunderstood. She did not approach them, but rather CNBC was there interviewing folks in the area.\r \n\nThere was no intention for us to do any interviews with CBNC. We had planned to have Pink on camera interviewing fellow apes, and she was late due to car trouble.\r  \n\r  \nu/rensole\r, u/atobitt, and luridess hopped in to fill in, and we covered the Shareholder the best we could. We had plans to get footage from inside, but after learning the rules by \r  \nGameStop\r apes honored their request to set up across the street. Then, once set up, they were asked to move again... We were able to get a few apes on regardless!\r  \n\r  \nI am very grateful to everyone who shared their footage and their streams.",
