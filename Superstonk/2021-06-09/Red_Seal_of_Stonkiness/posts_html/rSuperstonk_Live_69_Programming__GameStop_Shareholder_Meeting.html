<p>Please, for the love of DFV, represent us responsibly if you are attending this meeting. Retail investors receive enough flack from the mainstream media without adding pranksters at shareholder meetings to the list. Please dress appropriately and be respectful of everyone there.</p>
<p>We would like to err on the side of caution that IRL shills may attend and attempt to make us look bad, pretending to be part of this community when they are not. Typical, right? If you see anyone who seems to be intentionally sabotaging the ape image at this meeting, please take the necessary steps. That may range from speaking up against the individual, or reporting to security.</p>
<p>That said, I am insanely proud to be a part of this community. The fact that we have a team of individuals agreeing to run live streams and share this experience with the rest of us is truly heartwarming. I love this community with all of my heart and you all never cease to amaze me.</p>
<p>Now, let's go! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>

<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Hey everyone. I think there's a misconception. 
u/PinkCatsOnAcid
 mentioned that CNBC was trying to talk to HER and I relayed it to the live stream, and they misunderstood. She did not approach them, but rather CNBC was there interviewing folks in the area.</p>
<p>There was no intention for us to do any interviews with CBNC. We had planned to have Pink on camera interviewing fellow apes, and she was late due to car trouble.</p>
<p>u/rensole
, u/atobitt, and luridess hopped in to fill in, and we covered the Shareholder the best we could. We had plans to get footage from inside, but after learning the rules by </p>
<p>GameStop
 apes honored their request to set up across the street. Then, once set up, they were asked to move again... We were able to get a few apes on regardless!</p>
<p>I am very grateful to everyone who shared their footage and their streams.</p>
