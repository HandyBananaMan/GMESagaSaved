<p>On April 15, which was the record date to vote, the float was something like 54 million. (pre offering)</p>
<p>The odds of every. single. share voting is literally zero. We all know some shareholders weren't allowed to vote, like 40% of etoro, a million+ Swedish apes, and a bunch of lazy fuckers all over the world that couldn't be bothered, or people that just didn't realize they needed too/could.</p>
<p>Then we have ALL THE FUCKING PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT AFTER APRIL 15.</p>
<p><strong>We all know from the AMAs that GME can't accept voting results with votes tallying over 100%, so they "truncated" votes, and literally reported 100% of the float voted</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS FUCKING HUGE MY FRIENDS.</p>
<p>ANY doubt you had the hedgies are fuk before this should be completely washed away by these facts.</p>
<p>All we have to do is hold now (or buy if you want to, you do you dawg). This is the most ultimate confirmation we could have ever wished for.</p>
