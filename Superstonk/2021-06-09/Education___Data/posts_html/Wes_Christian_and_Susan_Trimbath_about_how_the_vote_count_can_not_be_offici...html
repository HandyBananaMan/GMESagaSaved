<p>I got this information from Dr. T and Wes (youtube time links to sources are below, with shoddy transcriptions - I recommend listening to the videos yourselves), but the pertinent part is Wes's comments from his AMA about overvoting. He stated if there's an overvote the company (GameStop in our case) can see the huge overvote numbers, but they must be massaged and culled before the final 8K reporting. He said it happens in a dark room, and is a complete joke.</p>
<p>Dr. T mentioned if an overvote occurs the company can hire an auditor of some sort of investigate exactly what happened. This is an option, but doesn't necessarily mean GameStop will take this line of action, though, it was Dr. T's explicit recommendation.</p>

<p>Q (Lucy) : Next question, if proxy votes far outnumber the float, how would that be handled by regulatory agencies, and if it goes to court will there be a squeeze or a settlement?</p>
<p>A (Wes) : Well there's many parts to that question. So let's start with the proxy vote. So as Susanne Trimbath says in book, the Naked Short and Greedy... It talks about this issue of over-voting is what they call it. The question is called over-voting at the DTC. She dealt with it when she worked at the DTC many years ago. Imagine that it's gotten worse. I'll tell you sadly, sadly how it's dealt with. It just gets wiped out. <strong>I can't get into details but I can tell you that the vote counters and proxy services will actually show that discrepancy the day before the record day, but on the record day, somehow, it all just gets washed out. It just acts like it, you know, I see nothing I know nothing I do nothing. So ultimately it's a joke, and it's a very sad joke.</strong> It does impair corporate governance though...</p>

<p>Dr. T : What do you do like you said right now, GME is in proxy season. And there's a story about Overstock in the book [her book Naked Short and Greedy] as well about what they, their proxy, what happened at their annual meeting when they got more votes in, and they knew for a fact that members of Patrick's family did not receive their proxies, so were unable to vote, right. There's umm... there's a website called <a href="https://inspectors-of-election.com">inspectors-of-election.com</a> ... The company has to do this, the investors don't do this, the company hires an inspector of elections, someone like Carl Hadberg for example. Who will actually go in and try to figure out... In my view, and this is Carl Hadberg's view as well, and he's much more experienced on that side of the business than I am, <strong>if you're an issuer and you get more votes in than shares outstanding you should not accept those election results. You need to stop, call in an inspector, and get this thing straightened out. This will help to reveal evidence if there is naked shorting, if there are fails to deliver, whatever's going on, it can be revealed.</strong> There are a few things that bubble up, there's a lot about fails to deliver, and naked short selling that you will never find in public information. Right? Even the issuers have a hard time finding out exactly what is happening with their stock. This is a long term problem. <strong>There are a few things that bubble up, and one of them is during the annual meeting that comes with voting</strong>.</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>The real vote count has in all likelihood been completely hidden, as this whole "process" is a sad joke, in Wes's own terms. This is not GameStop's fault, but merely that the system here is a bit broken (like we all knew)!</p>
<p><strong>So we don't know what numbers GameStop saw, and we don't know what their plan is. Ryan explicitly said in the shareholder meeting he won't be telegraphing his plans to his enemies, and instead wants us to be patient and wait to see what action they take.</strong></p>
