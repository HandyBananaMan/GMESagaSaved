On April 15, which was the record date to vote, the float was something like 54 million. (pre offering)

The odds of every. single. share voting is literally zero. We all know some shareholders weren't allowed to vote, like 40% of etoro, a million+ Swedish apes, and a bunch of lazy fuckers all over the world that couldn't be bothered, or people that just didn't realize they needed too/could.

Then we have ALL THE FUCKING PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT AFTER APRIL 15.

**We all know from the AMAs that GME can't accept voting results with votes tallying over 100%, so they "truncated" votes, and literally reported 100% of the float voted**

THIS IS FUCKING HUGE MY FRIENDS.

ANY doubt you had the hedgies are fuk before this should be completely washed away by these facts.

All we have to do is hold now (or buy if you want to, you do you dawg). This is the most ultimate confirmation we could have ever wished for.

edit: my sentiment is right, but my facts might be not as right.
