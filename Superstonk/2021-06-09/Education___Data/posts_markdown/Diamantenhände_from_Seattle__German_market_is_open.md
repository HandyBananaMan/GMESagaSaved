FAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie and converting to USD. Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.21876756. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.

I'm not trying to permanently take over this tradition, just keep it going for fun on days when u/DerGurkenraspler doesn't start the thread at the normal time. They have been unexpectedly absent recently, but I will gladly bow out of this role when they resume updates. Many apes are concerned for our German friend. While I have not heard directly from u/DerGurkenraspler, I have heard from someone who had been in contact with them previously that it seemed likely that they are okay, but have some external factors that they need to focus on.
