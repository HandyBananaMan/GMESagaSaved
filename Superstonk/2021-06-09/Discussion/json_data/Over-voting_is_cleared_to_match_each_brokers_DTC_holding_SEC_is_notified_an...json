    "selftext": "\nHi fellow Apes! \n\nA lot of FUD has been shared around the 'low' vote count; this needs to be rectified! \ud83d\ude42 A bit of visible frustration in the livestream as well! \n\n*The vote was never going to be higher than the float:*\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxyprocess/proxyvotingbrief.htm\n\n(clipout) - - >\n\"*How can these issues [over-voting] be addressed, and at what cost or consequence?*\n\nBackground: Generally broker-dealers attempt to address the over-vote/under-vote situation by implementing of one of three reconciliation methods: (1) \u201cpost-mailing reconciliation\u201d; (2) \u201cpre-mailing reconciliation\u201d; or (3) a hybrid process of both post-mailing and pre-mailing reconciliation.\n\nPost-mailing reconciliation (post-reconciliation) is a process whereby the data is reconciled to accommodate an over-vote situation after the broker-dealer\u2019s customers have submitted their votes. If the broker-dealer votes in excess of its position at DTC, the broker-dealer will reconcile or adjust the number of votes to correspond to its DTC position.\"\n\nTL;DR: vote counts are adjusted BY THE BROKERS to be within normal parameters if over-voting occurs. \n\n\n... so there you have it.
