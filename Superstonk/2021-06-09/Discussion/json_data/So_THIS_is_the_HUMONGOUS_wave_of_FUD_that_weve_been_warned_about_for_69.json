Think about all the things she\u2019s done so far for all of us. The Jungle Beat, all her posts. Now she\u2019s made a mistake and all the shills have come out in force. I\u2019ve seen several posts saying she should be removed as mod and kicked out. \n\nARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS????? \n\nThis is bullshit. We need to be even more supportive now. All the shills have come out and are currently having a field day, dividing the community. Please, I know we don\u2019t have much brain cells because we\u2019re all retarded, but try and see past this situation. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT FOR US!!!\n\nThe shills will probably come out for this post too going nuts in the comments and this post will get downvoted but please remember one thing true apes\n\n#APES TOGETHER STRONG \n\nalso \n\n#BUY AND HODL\n\nEDIT : \n\n#PINK DID NOT DO A CNBC INTERVIEW\n\nAll the FUD is now coming to light. Strap up apes. This\u2019ll be one rollercoaster of a ride \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
