    "selftext": "A few questions to ask yourself:\n\n- Why does the price pop consistently every T+21 days?\n\n- Why does the price flash crash before going above $350?\n\n- Why have we now experienced almost three gamma squeezes with lots of abnormal downward pressure?\n\n- Why is the repo market blowing up and continuing to blow up?\n\n- Why have banks + Citadel been told to bring sleeping bags to work and been not allowed to leave since mid April? [Just a joke about the sleeping bags lol. They have been \"busier than usual\" on google analytics for the nights and weekends]\n\n- Why are the DTC, ICC, and OCC all prepared for massive defaults in the financial world?\n\n- Why does Crypto dump prior to every T+21 cycle?\n\n- Why have other subbreddits been taken over and peddle other stocks which go on insane runs prior to GME taking a hit?\n\nLots more to list of course! As well as all of the DD and AMAs!\n\nThey haven't covered in my eyes. \n\nOne of them on Kenny's team isn't accepting the /forfeit vote.",
