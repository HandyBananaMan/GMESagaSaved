    "selftext": "Notice how quickly this 8-K was filed? Minutes after the conference?? And as we know last year (and I believe typically) the voting company didn't provide results to the company until 3 business days after, and Gamestop filed the 8-K on the 4th day. \n\nWhy were they able to file so quick this time? Maybe because they already knew what they'd be filing, they didn't need more time for vote count. \n\nHow would that be the case? Well when more than the float gets counted for votes, the voting company's voting system scales the votes back to 100% of the float. \n\nMaybe they surpassed 100% of the float 5, or 10, or 15 days ago. Had that shit prepared a while ago and BAM filed it today.\n\nI posted the above as a comment in a thread where OP provided a screenshot of 54.7M Float Outstanding reported by Marketwatch, which is exactly the vote count we got in today's filing. So that proves that 100% of the float is outstanding.\n\nThen someone informed me that this was talked about in the live r/superstonk show that took place after the conference earlier. And they built on the idea, with a theory saying that Gamestop popped this 8-K out so quickly in order to only give the SHFs one day of ammo to short attack and shake paperhands. If they waited 4 days just for the hell of it, then the SHFs would be able to short attack today under the guise of \"oh it's just earnings volatility\" and then a second time 4 days later under the guise of \"oh vote count didn't exceed the shares outstanding, guess that's why the price dropped another $80.\" \n\nGamestop is 3 steps ahead of these guys. Gamestop is playing 4D chess while they are playing checkers. \n\nBring on the vote audit.",
