    "selftext": "Today\u2019s livestream and the shill infested daily comment thread amplifying the unrest caused from it is a prime example. Sure, the livestream was a little annoying, I stopped watching after a few minutes myself, but shills in the daily thread quickly picked up on that conflict and amplified it to a level where it seemed like Rome was burning to the ground. They\u2019re going to take any real source of conflict from here on out and use it to sew as much chaos and dissent as possible. Fracturing this community is their reason for existing at this point. Let\u2019s make their job as challenging as humanly possible. Love, unity, support, positive energy, those are the states of being that crush the shill mission.",
    "title": "Shills have evolved. They\u2019ve learned they can no longer manufacture conflict and mayhem. So they\u2019re reduced to amplifying authentic conflict to try to create mayhem. Our best defense from here on out is unity and positive energy.",
