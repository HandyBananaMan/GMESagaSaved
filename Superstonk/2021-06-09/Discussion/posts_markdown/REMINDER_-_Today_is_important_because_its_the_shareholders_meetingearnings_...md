#Title: REMINDER - Today is important because it's the shareholder's meeting/earnings. It was NEVER a prediction for the MOASS.

This is a reminder that the significance of this date was never to believe that today's shareholders meeting would spark the MOASS immediately. Nor expect the price to sky rocket straight away.

From yesterday's weak flash crash, its obvious the stock can still be manipulated pretty hard. They will use MSM to find negatives in the earnings and play all of their dirty tricks. However, their attempts are clearly becoming weaker and weaker. 

Expect the fuckery that was always there and remember to do the same thing you've always done -


**BUY AND HODL**
