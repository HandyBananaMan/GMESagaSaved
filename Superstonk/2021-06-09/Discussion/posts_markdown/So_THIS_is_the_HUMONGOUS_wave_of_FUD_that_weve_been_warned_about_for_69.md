Apes, we knew that the hedgies and shills were gonna be upping the FUD a whole fucking tonne of notches today, and it‚Äôs clear to see that it‚Äôs to do with the mods, just like GME and WSB.

True, Pink made a mistake talking the CNBC i‚Äôll admit, but she‚Äôs only human (edit : She didn‚Äôt do an interview at all, shills created this rumour) . Think about all the things she‚Äôs done so far for all of us. The Jungle Beat, all her posts. Now she‚Äôs made a mistake and all the shills have come out in force. I‚Äôve seen several posts saying she should be removed as mod and kicked out. 

ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS????? 

This is bullshit. We need to be even more supportive now. All the shills have come out and are currently having a field day, dividing the community. Please, I know we don‚Äôt have much brain cells because we‚Äôre all retarded, but try and see past this situation. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT FOR US!!!

The shills will probably come out for this post too going nuts in the comments and this post will get downvoted but please remember one thing true apes

#APES TOGETHER STRONG 

also 

#BUY AND HODL

EDIT : 

#PINK DID NOT DO A CNBC INTERVIEW

All the FUD is now coming to light. Strap up apes. This‚Äôll be one rollercoaster of a ride üôåüèª
