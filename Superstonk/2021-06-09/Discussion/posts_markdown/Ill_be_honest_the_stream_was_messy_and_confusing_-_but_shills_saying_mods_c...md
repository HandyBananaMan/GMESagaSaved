That stream was decent to start with, and I'm grateful for the mods putting in the time to do it (especially those that hadn't expected to be there). But that was a mess.

Pink not being in the meeting (why was she dispatched then?) [EDIT - CLARIFICATION, PINK DID NOT GIVE AN INTERVIEW TO CNBC] , celebrations over the price going up by 1%, and mass claims of "confirmed" over voting (when the wording does NOT mean that necessarily, nor was it confirmed by those in the meeting).

Having said all that - thank you mods for doing your best with it. It was chaos, but I remain faithful in you all for the work and DD you do to keep this sub running well. Late developments like Satori have been huge, and really useful. Anybody that is saying "ruh ruh mods compromised brr gotta move" is a shill and can fuck right off.

The simple truth behind this beauty of a stock is buy and hold. That's it.
