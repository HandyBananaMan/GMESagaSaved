#Title: Take a breather and remember how the price spikes consistently in T+21 patterns. They're stuck in a loop and to me they haven't covered. We expected this price dip and FUD attack.

A few questions to ask yourself:

- Why does the price pop consistently every T+21 days?

- Why does the price flash crash before going above $350?

- Why have we now experienced almost three gamma squeezes with lots of abnormal downward pressure?

- Why is the repo market blowing up and continuing to blow up?

- Why have banks + Citadel been told to bring sleeping bags to work and been not allowed to leave since mid April? [Just a joke about the sleeping bags lol. They have been "busier than usual" on google analytics for the nights and weekends]

- Why are the DTC, ICC, and OCC all prepared for massive defaults in the financial world?

- Why does Crypto dump prior to every T+21 cycle?

- Why have other subbreddits been taken over and peddle other stocks which go on insane runs prior to GME taking a hit?

Lots more to list of course! As well as all of the DD and AMAs!

They haven't covered in my eyes.
