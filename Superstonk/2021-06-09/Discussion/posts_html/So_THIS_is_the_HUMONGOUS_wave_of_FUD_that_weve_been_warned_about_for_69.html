<p>Apes, we knew that the hedgies and shills were gonna be upping the FUD a whole fucking tonne of notches today, and it‚Äôs clear to see that it‚Äôs to do with the mods, just like GME and WSB.</p>
<p>True, Pink made a mistake talking the CNBC i‚Äôll admit, but she‚Äôs only human (edit : She didn‚Äôt do an interview at all, shills created this rumour) . Think about all the things she‚Äôs done so far for all of us. The Jungle Beat, all her posts. Now she‚Äôs made a mistake and all the shills have come out in force. I‚Äôve seen several posts saying she should be removed as mod and kicked out. </p>
<p>ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS????? </p>
<p>This is bullshit. We need to be even more supportive now. All the shills have come out and are currently having a field day, dividing the community. Please, I know we don‚Äôt have much brain cells because we‚Äôre all retarded, but try and see past this situation. THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT FOR US!!!</p>
<p>The shills will probably come out for this post too going nuts in the comments and this post will get downvoted but please remember one thing true apes</p>
<h1>APES TOGETHER STRONG</h1>
<p>also </p>
<h1>BUY AND HODL</h1>
<p>EDIT : </p>
<h1>PINK DID NOT DO A CNBC INTERVIEW</h1>
<p>All the FUD is now coming to light. Strap up apes. This‚Äôll be one rollercoaster of a ride üôåüèª</p>
