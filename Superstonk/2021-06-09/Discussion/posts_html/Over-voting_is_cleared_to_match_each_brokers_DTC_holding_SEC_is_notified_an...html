<p>Hi fellow Apes! </p>
<p>A lot of FUD has been shared around the 'low' vote count; this needs to be rectified! 🙂 A bit of visible frustration in the livestream as well! </p>
<p><em>The vote was never going to be higher than the float:</em></p>

"<em>How can these issues [over-voting] be addressed, and at what cost or consequence?</em></p>
<p>Background: Generally broker-dealers attempt to address the over-vote/under-vote situation by implementing of one of three reconciliation methods: (1) “post-mailing reconciliation”; (2) “pre-mailing reconciliation”; or (3) a hybrid process of both post-mailing and pre-mailing reconciliation.</p>
<p>Post-mailing reconciliation (post-reconciliation) is a process whereby the data is reconciled to accommodate an over-vote situation after the broker-dealer’s customers have submitted their votes. If the broker-dealer votes in excess of its position at DTC, the broker-dealer will reconcile or adjust the number of votes to correspond to its DTC position."</p>
<p>TL;DR: vote counts are adjusted BY THE BROKERS to be within normal parameters if over-voting occurs. </p>
<p>... so there you have it. Tits should still be jacked!! Mine are 😅 💎👐=🚀 🚀 🚀</p>
