<p>Notice how quickly this 8-K was filed? Minutes after the conference?? And as we know last year (and I believe typically) the voting company didn't provide results to the company until 3 business days after, and Gamestop filed the 8-K on the 4th day. </p>
<p>Why were they able to file so quick this time? Maybe because they already knew what they'd be filing, they didn't need more time for vote count. </p>
<p>How would that be the case? Well when more than the float gets counted for votes, the voting company's voting system scales the votes back to 100% of the float. </p>
<p>Maybe they surpassed 100% of the float 5, or 10, or 15 days ago. Had that shit prepared a while ago and BAM filed it today.</p>
<p>I posted the above as a comment in a thread where OP provided a screenshot of 54.7M Float Outstanding reported by Marketwatch, which is exactly the vote count we got in today's filing. So that proves that 100% of the float is outstanding.</p>
<p>Then someone informed me that this was talked about in the live r/superstonk show that took place after the conference earlier. And they built on the idea, with a theory saying that Gamestop popped this 8-K out so quickly in order to only give the SHFs one day of ammo to short attack and shake paperhands. If they waited 4 days just for the hell of it, then the SHFs would be able to short attack today under the guise of "oh it's just earnings volatility" and then a second time 4 days later under the guise of "oh vote count didn't exceed the shares outstanding, guess that's why the price dropped another $80." </p>
<p>Gamestop is 3 steps ahead of these guys. Gamestop is playing 4D chess while they are playing checkers. </p>
<p>Bring on the vote audit.</p>
