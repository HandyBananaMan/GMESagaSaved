<p>First thing, I have absolutely NO issue with people calling out the mods when they are wrong. BUt to call it embarassing is too much. The only thing "embarassing" was how quickly apes here were ready to turn on the mods. These people spend hours a day keeping us informed, updated, and in this fight. Maybe today didn't go perfect on the live YouTube but to turn on them so quick makes me think that is all FUD.</p>
<p>And if it isn't shill accounts trying to get us to turn on each other then that is even worse. You all that posted for mods to step down, not speak, etc. should be ashamed.</p>
<p>I stand with the mods. Y'all keep doing what you're doing, correct yourself when wrong (as you have), and the important people will stick this out.</p>
