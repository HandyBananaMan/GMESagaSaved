<p>Final edit: I have debunked myself. Check out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw7t2u/etoro_statistics_show_that_retail_owns_about_75/">new post here</a> with the updated information. TLDR is that retail owns 75 million share on April 15th and it's far more accurate.</p>
<p>~~Quick little math here. Not sure how many of you here are on the live stream, but Atobitt talked on stream about how brokers can simply not submit your votes and pay a small fine. Nevertheless, let's take a quick look at the numbers.~~</p>
<p>~~GME reported 55 million votes this year.~~</p>
<p>~~The float is \~41million. We know Blackrock, and various other institutions~~ <strong>~~are NOT voting this year because they are lending out their shares. If you lend out your shares, you lose your voting privilege.~~</strong> ~~It seems unlikely the short-sellers plan on voting, as they know we want to see a high vote number.~~</p>
<p><strong>~~Edit 4: YES I AM AWARE THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THE SHARES FROM SHORTED LENDED SHARES CAN VOTE. Those people are part of retail.~~</strong></p>
<p>~~Etoro has stated that 63% of eligible GME shares have voted (Disappointing, I know).~~</p>

<p>~~Etoro can be used as an accurate representation of what GME holders do in general, simply due to the sheer number of people on Etoro.~~ <strong>~~This is because Etoro's large number of customers is an extremely good sample size for statistical significance.~~</strong> ~~Statistical significance requires at least 100 people, Etoro has a few more GME shares than that.~~</p>
<p>~~If we assume only 63% of eligible voters voted, then the total number of shares is 88 million.~~</p>
<p>~~That's about 215% of the float. Even with all the fuckery, we still own it. Don't forget, this was back in April.~~</p>
<p>~~Buy. HODL. Buckle up.~~</p>
