<p>A few questions to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why does the price pop consistently every T+21 days?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does the price flash crash before going above $350?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why have we now experienced almost three gamma squeezes with lots of abnormal downward pressure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the repo market blowing up and continuing to blow up?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why have banks + Citadel been told to bring sleeping bags to work and been not allowed to leave since mid April? [Just a joke about the sleeping bags lol. They have been "busier than usual" on google analytics for the nights and weekends]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are the DTC, ICC, and OCC all prepared for massive defaults in the financial world?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does Crypto dump prior to every T+21 cycle?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why have other subbreddits been taken over and peddle other stocks which go on insane runs prior to GME taking a hit?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots more to list of course! As well as all of the DD and AMAs!</p>
<p>They haven't covered in my eyes. </p>
<p>One of them on Kenny's team isn't accepting the /forfeit vote.</p>
