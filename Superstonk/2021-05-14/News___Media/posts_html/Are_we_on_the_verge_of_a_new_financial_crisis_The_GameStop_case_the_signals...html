<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>The other day in the post "Italian News Article Tells of Incoming US Market Chaos" fellow Ape u/Nixin83 posted a very interesting article that has unfortunately gone unnoticed; we thought was worth bringing it to the attention of everyone so we could have a look at it.</p>
<p>To give you an overview, it talks about how we might be heading towards a new market crash, GME, the signals from the Hedge Funds, liquidity and cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The interesting part that sets it apart from many articles we often read, is how they acknowledge the Squeeze is still an ongoing matter that could actually fire in the next months and why according to them.</p>
<p>I translated it by hand as the original piece is in Italian and didn't want to risk losing anything in translation; looking forward to hear your thoughts, here it is:</p>

<h1>Are we on the verge of a new financial crisis? The GameStop case, the signals of Hedge Funds and the rise of cryptocurrencies</h1>
<p>by Nicola Sindaco</p>
<h2>Is there a link between the GameStop case, the surge in cryptocurrency prices (primarily Bitcoin), and the recent bankruptcy of the American fund Archegos? The overexposure of financial players, made possible by the quantitative easing policies of central banks in the Covid era, and the lowering of the level of credit risk, in a context of increasing deregulation and non-regulation of the Shadow Banking sector, is increasingly attracting financial actors with a high propensity to risk, with the imminent risk of triggering a new, devastating financial crisis.</h2>
<h1>The roots of the last crisis (and the next one?): deregulation and non-regulation</h1>
<p>The financialization of the world economy promoted by American President Bill Clinton with the signing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in November 1999, which went down in history with the journalistic epithet deregulation, turns out to be the key to shedding light on the origin of latest recent global financial crisis. The deregulation repealed the Glass-Steagall Act which previously prohibited so-called BanCorp (bank holding companies) from controlling other financial institutions, marking a boundary between commercial, investment banks, Hedge Funds, other investment funds and insurance institutions, and standardizing made the enlarged banking and financial system under a single risk model.</p>
<p>Previously, slackening tendencies had already been in place since 1997 with the decision of the then President of the Federal Reserve (FED) Alan Greenspan to keep the derivatives market and Shadow Banking completely deregulated (i.e. the sector of investment funds and large financial institutions that act as banks without being de facto). In addition, the relaxation of the equity rule approved in April 2004 by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), repealing the text of the same 1975 law, allowed large financial institutions (with capital exceeding 5 billion dollars) to simply submit their exemption file to the SEC in order to decide autonomously its own net capital, or rather its net liquidity buffer to be used as a guarantee of solvency of the investment portfolio.</p>
<p>The non-regulation of Shadow Banking and the deregulation of the global financial system meant that speculative instruments such as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) could be used as balances (<em>hedge</em>) against credit risk without the parties involved having anything to do with the stipulation of the original credit / debt contract and therefore without necessarily having to own the debt instrument (share, bond or derivative). As a result, the volume of CDS increased a hundredfold in the decade 1998-2008 and the trend had already been noticed in 2003 by the famous investor Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, leading him to define the derivatives "financial weapons of mass destruction".</p>
<p>The financial crisis rooted in the aforementioned legislative choices then found fertile ground in the creative work of BanCorps, in particular in the form of subprime mortgages and derivatives such as <em>Collateralized Default Obligations</em> (CDO) and the aforementioned Credit Default Swaps. The swelling of the American real estate bubble, the easy access to credit for banking institutions and their customers, added to the attitudes that can be placed in the grey of the law and the fraudulent attitudes of the actors involved, led the entire system to experience peaks of financial euphoria. results in overleveraging (excessive exposure to the risk of default) and subsequently in the collapse of the entire house of cards.</p>
<p>If deregulation has acted as a systemic catalyst, the American real estate bubble can be seen as the spark and overleveraging should be understood as an amplifier of the spread of the fire. The domino effect was such as to lead to the collapse of the American economy first and then the world one within 18 months (from the first bankruptcy due to subprime in April 2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns in 2008), recording in the first quarter of 2009 a violent decline of the major world stock exchanges equal to 9.8% for the Eurozone, with peaks of 14.4% in Germany, 15.2% in Japan and 21.5% in Mexico.</p>
<p>The decade 2010-2020 then subsequently experienced the aftermath of the global financial crisis, seeing the European debt crisis worsening (2009-2012), preceded by the collapse of entire national financial systems such as the Icelandic one and real defaults such as the Greek one, as well as register an unemployment rate of 10%.</p>
<h1>Between creative finance and expansive monetary policies</h1>
<p>The new decade did not start in the best way for the planet, and not only from an economic-financial point of view. The advent of Covid-19 has forced governments to apply extreme measures to a total national lock-down in an attempt to contain the pandemic expansion. In March 2020, the markets responded to the Covid factor with a vertical decline very similar to that recorded eleven years earlier due to the financial crisis, but the important <em>Quantitative Easing</em> measures implemented by the major global economic powers meant that the markets restarted quickly. and reached the highest peaks ever reached in the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent recovery, some values ​​are altered and the impact of these alterations does not seem to have yet been quantified at a macro-economic level, although it is not known to date whether the problem has been faced behind closed doors in the halls of power. of the world economy and finance. All that remains is to ask questions and try to suggest answers pending further data, details and official confirmations.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, governments around the world have been preparing to launch aggressively expansionist policies to cauterize the wound suddenly opened by Covid-19; but at what price? Although journalistically and morally evaluated as a commendable effort, the constant stimulus packages directly paid by the States into the pockets of citizens, the transversal injections of capital that have made the entire economic-financial fabric more liquid (from private companies to credit institutions) and the relaxation of lending and repayment policies have exponentially increased the working capital, leading to fears of the advent of hyper-inflationary waves, as well as increasing the systemic risk in relation to credit exposure.</p>
<p>In reality, inflationary peaks have not occurred, especially in consideration of the fact that generally these are recorded in situations where there is a convergence of three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>excess liquidity;</li>
<li>full employment;</li>
<li>high speed of circulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pandemic has practically acted as a barrier to inflation, preventing the fulfilment of points 2 and 3 just listed. At the same time, the surge in stock markets after the collapse of March 2020 is to be considered financed more by these liquidity injections into the world economy than directly proportional to the growth of gross world product.</p>
<h1>The Bitcoin boom and the new digital asset economy</h1>
<p>A good idea on the subject is provided by the surge in the prices of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, obviously headed by Bitcoin. A necessary digression is needed to give context. Ten years after its appearance, Bitcoin appears to be the asset with the best performance, that is, with the best economic return (ROI) in the world. To give an example, HowMuch.net (financial education site) calculated that 100 $ invested at the beginning of 2009 in today's best multinationals (such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook) would have produced the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook 520 $ = + 420%</li>
<li>Microsoft $ 1,000 = + 899%</li>
<li>Apple 2.400 $ = + 2.345%</li>
<li>Amazon $ 3,300 = + 3.156%</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same period (January 2009 - December 2019), $ 100 invested in Bitcoin would have recorded the following growth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin $ 9,200,000 = 9,150,088%</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, the number is calculated on the values ​​of December 2019, when 1 Bitcoin was available for purchase for $ 7,500. Today, in April 2021, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to approximately $ 57,500, a further + 750% compared to the above figure of $9.2M. Without wishing to go into the merits of the use-case of Bitcoin and the innovative concept of blockchain, the Bitcoin case serves the purpose of demonstrating how the surge in prices in the last twelve months or so is dictated by the excess of new printed currency.</p>
<p>Intrinsic features of Bitcoin are network security (non-hackability of the system), scarcity (there is a finite number of Bitcoins and once in circulation no more can be produced) and the democratized supply system. These characteristics, [read through the lens provided by "Metcalfe's law"](<a href="https://dcresearch.medium.com/metcalfes-law-and-bitcoin-s-value-2b99c7efd1fa">https://dcresearch.medium.com/metcalfes-law-and-bitcoin-s-value-2b99c7efd1fa</a> have allowed many economists and mathematicians to make really ambitious predictions for the price of Bitcoin in the future. Originally presented in 1980 by Robert Metcalfe to describe the impact of telephony in an exponentially proportional manner to the increase of telephones in society (<em>compatible communicating devices</em>, the theory was later refined by George Gilder in 1993 and applied to Ethernet. In its basic form, the law states that the value of the telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users connected to the system (n²), where n equals the number of nodes.</p>
<p>https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco1.jpg</p>
<p>To put it simply, the value of a network is proportional to the number of participants in the network squared. This law applies to the growth of Bitcoin to perfection, showing perfect correlation between the increase in the number of Bitcoin addresses (wallet addresses) and the increase in the price.</p>
<p>https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco2-1024x633.jpg</p>
<p>This correlation has led to multiple projections and forecasts, the most famous of which is that of PlanB (where B stands for Bitcoin), a Dutch institutional investor with an academic background in quantitative law and finance, which through its Stock-To-Flow Model (S2F) elaborated and published in March 2019 had predicted a value of $ 55,000 for Bitcoin by 2021, or a market capitalization of $ 1 trillion (at the time of the forecast, Bitcoin was valued at $ 4,000 and in its ten-year history it had reached $ 20,000 per coin just once, at the peak of December 2017).</p>
<p>Bitcoin was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto in the famous white paper of October 31, 2008 and the first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and its open source code was made accessible to the world on January 8, 2009; as described and envisaged in the white paper, Bitcoin not only has a predefined maximum quantity - Hard Cap - but is "mined" block by block, Proof-of-Work after Proof-of-Work (PoW), through mining ("extraction "). Every 210,000 blocks - approximately every four years - the amount of "mineable" Bitcoin halves in a process known as halving.</p>
<p>The PlanB model tracks the past, present and future value of Bitcoin in correlation with increasing scarcity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock = is the quantity of existing product/currency/commodity (in this case of Bitcoin);</li>
<li>Flow = is the annual production of the asset in question;</li>
</ul>
<p>The following tab will serve as an example:</p>
<p>https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco3.jpg</p>
<p>Gold records a stock-to-flow (SF) of 62, implying that it would take 62 years of production to reach the quantity of product existing today; for silver it takes 22 years and this makes both assets excellent reserves of monetary value.</p>
<p>In the following graph, the regression line drawn to better plot the entered data confirms the impression that one has with the naked eye: a statistically significant relationship between SF and market value (note that the model is based on production halving - <em>Halving</em>- as shown on the right and the value is calculated on a logarithmic scale as shown on the left - covering 8 orders of magnitude).</p>
<p>It turns out to be quite interesting that gold and silver, while being completely different markets, are in line with the values ​​of the Bitcoin model regarding the SF.</p>
<p>https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco4.jpg</p>
<p>The then visionary forecast was then followed by another equally "reckless" one, which estimated the market capitalization of Bitcoin at around 5.5 trillion dollars, or $ 288,000 per coin before the advent of the next Halving (April 19, 2024).</p>
<p>https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco5.jpg</p>
<p>To date, Bitcoin seems to follow PlanB's S2F Model to the letter.</p>
<p>https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco6.jpg</p>
<p>In fact, the speed with which Bitcoin reached the value of $ 55,000 ($ 1 trillion Market Cap) was found to be excessive according to many analysts and led to the conclusion that the value of Bitcoin and the stock market in general are extremely inflated, this is precisely because of the recent capital injections by governments around the world.</p>
<p>According to a survey by Mizuho Securities on March 15, 40 billion dollars of the 380 ready to be injected into the American economy will be allocated for investments and two out of five people (40%) said they would prefer to bet on Bitcoin rather than invest in traditional assets.</p>

<h1>A new crisis on the horizon</h1>
<p>The liquidity injection recorded in the last twelve months in the United States alone has seen the amount of dollars in circulation (2 trillion) increase by an incredible 40%, accelerating the devaluation of the currency. This devaluation may not be immediately recognizable in the real economy, as the lock-down measures have significantly slowed down the speed of circulation and the pandemic has generally aggravated the unemployment rate; but the symptoms are definitely noticeable in the financial market, with the peaks recorded by all the assets in circulation: commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds.</p>
<p>How are these signs indicators of a possible dire future? The thesis we support is that of the overvaluation of all markets, deriving from the over-exposure of financial actors (<em>overleveraging</em>) a situation made possible by the policies of quantitative easing, injections of currency at zero interest by central banks (FED in primis) and the lowering of the level of credit risk (i.e. an easier access to credit for large financial institutions in order to “Pumping” liquidity into the economy across the board). These circumstances, added to the deregulation and non-regulation of the Shadow Banking sector, have attracted more and more financial players with a high propensity to risk, as their success is calculated purely quantitatively following the "Two and Twenty" law:</p>
<ul>
<li>2% of the managed capital (<em>Asset Under Management</em>) is the commission received regardless of the results;</li>
<li>20% of profits is the commission received upon completion of a successful transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This rule, juxtaposed with the very nature of Hedge Funds, ie their being "resource aggregators" (coming from the fund's investors / financiers) and mere "managers" of the latter, together with the lewd climate from a legislative and expansive point of view, as well as from a monetary point of view, they are triggering a credit overexposure mechanism that could risk a real <em>systemic failure</em> if you do not act in time.</p>
<p>Hedge Funds are high risk / return vehicles of speculation and operate with short-term maneuvers in order to maximize the return; among the strategies most used by these funds is <em>levering</em>, debt-based investment and short-selling. The expansionism recorded in the last decade of monetary policies, the extreme <em>quantitative easing</em> of the last twelve months to cope with the pandemic crisis, added to the zero interest rate policy by central banks, have created a liquidity tsunami that has led to a very risky relaxation of the credit sector. It should be noted that the institutional financial system is the de facto lung of a country's finance and economy. The zero interest decided by the hyper-expansionary monetary policies poured liquidity into the financial and credit sector starting from the credit institutions, then expanding like wildfire towards insurance institutions, pension funds, Hedge Funds and, due to the (<em>trickle- down effect</em>), flooded the financial market and the world stock exchanges.</p>
<p>The mechanism is quite elementary: credit institutions are incentivized to accumulate interest-free liquidity from central banks; the operators, or the bankers, earn commissions, that is a percentage of the money lent, therefore they are incentivized to give loans; and the greater flows of credit capital are required by investment funds, which in turn use the available capital to obtain deeper lines of credit and at the same time earn 2% of the assets managed (resulting in an extremely incentive to credit exposure) . Obviously, all these institutions use insurance institutions to protect their operations in the event of a default / bankruptcy of one of the creditors, and these institutions in turn tend to mitigate their default risk through debt collateralisation and Credit Default Swaps.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that as long as the market wind blows in the direction of the big investors, profits are calculated in billions of dollars and the system thrives; the problem begins to arise when the market becomes almost impracticable even for these subjects despite being highly specialized, equipped and financed.</p>
<h1>The GameStop case: Hedge Fund vs. Wall Street Bets</h1>
<p>When at the end of January 2021 the GME title of the video game retail chain GameStop reached $ 483 in value on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the world did not notice and few knew the story behind the surge. the price; even today, very few know what is happening and it is our intention to shed light on one of the potentially most important events in the financial history of the last ten years and which could perhaps mark the future of the economy and finance by forcing the American legislator (and many others to follow) to change the rules of the game.</p>
<p>A dutiful preamble: the GameStop company has been living its third age for years and its business model based on stores and sales of consoles and video games is going in the same terminal direction as that of a giant of the past that has failed today: Blockbuster. GME stock has for years mirrored what Wall Street thought of its archaic business model: the tendency to bankruptcy. The value of the stock has performed in a range between 4-5 dollars for years with no movements whatsoever, almost waiting for the coup de grace. Even before the pandemic, many financial players (in particular Hedge Funds) took advantage of the weakness and corporate immobility to speculate on the failure and consequential de-listing of the stock from the stock exchange. This speculation took place in the form of short selling: this is a common practice in finance, which is equivalent to a bet "against" the performance of a company, or by making the investor gain the more the company is in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In April 2020, when the panic generated by the lock-down measures hit the world stock exchanges, the stock collapsed to an all-time low to touch $ 2.60 and indirectly confirming to investors that they had aimed against the company's survival. that their assumptions were well founded, incentivizing them to double their shorting positions assuming that the lock-down would deliver the final coup de grace. Meanwhile, other investors around the world have assessed the company's future differently, in conjunction with the fact that the new consoles are still producing slots for reading CDs and DVDs and therefore total digitization seems to be still far away, as far as the horizon is concerned. Investors such as Michael Burry (CEO of Scion Asset Management and the first ever to predict the American real estate bubble) and Ryan Cohen (CEO and founder of Chewy, the world's leading e-commerce company in the sale of pet products) have read great potential in the company and certainly in the GME stock, considering it undervalued.</p>
<p>Their considerations throughout 2020 were then adopted by some small investors (retail investors) headed by the Youtuber "RoaringKitty", known on the Reddit platform under the pseudonym of u/ DeepF — ingValue, born Keith Patrick Gill. By the end of 2020, Cohen had bought 13% of the company's stock while the stock had risen from $ 2.60 to around $ 20. The situation was hot for many Hedge Funds, who found themselves overexposed in their shorting strategy against a stock that had seen its value multiply 7.7 times its lowest price (far from bankruptcy!). Meanwhile, the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, on which Gill continued to post his analyzes, comments and evidence of his investments, had adopted the title in a sort of protest against finance, like an Occupy Wall Street 2.0.</p>
<p>This protest, combined with genuine consideration of the potential of the GME stock and the GameStop company to transform with Cohen's entry into the board of directors, has resulted in a bulk purchase of the stock on every online trading platform accessible to the small investor. The stock jumped from $ 20 to $ 483 in just a few days, reducing some Hedge Funds almost to the streets, the most affected of which was undoubtedly Melvin Capital (to which the Citadel Securities fund with 2.75 billion dollars had to come to the rescue. and Point72 with 750 million bailouts). The surge triggered a sudden Short Squeeze, or the rush to buy back shares by those actors who had bet on the fall to contain the losses resulting from the surge; buyback that combined with the pressure of the surge itself tends to exacerbate the volume of purchases by inflating the value of the shares in question: the catalyst was the discovery by the "people of Reddit" that the shares subject to shorting were more than 100% of the number of existing official shares, implying that the shorters were applying the technique of Naked Short Selling (the practice of selling "shares short", or the sale of a security without having possession of it, not receiving it on loan or even making sure that this loan possibly possible) and "producing" "synthetic", "derivative" actions and placing oneself in the condition of being subject to squeeze.</p>
<p>In the following weeks, the stock fell in what initially appeared to be the deflation of the bubble, or the natural <em>post-squeeze</em> regression of a stock towards its real market value (as happened in 2008 for Volkswagen stock). In fact, due to the non-regulation of Hedge Funds and the fact that short positions are not subject to quarterly disclosure to the SEC, the small investors who meet in droves daily on Reddit and discuss the topic have continued (and continue to date) to speculate and argue that the squeeze has not yet occurred and the fall in the share price is only the result of market manipulation. In January, the value of the stock was held back by the work of the actors most at risk, namely Hedge Funds and online trading platforms. During the hectic stages of the takeover, small investors were cut off from buying shares and found the purchase functionality blocked on their trading apps (the shares could only be sold). Platforms such as Robinhood have been accused of collusion with big funds by small investors who flooded Twitter, Reddit (r/WallStreetBets; r/Gamestop ; r/Superstonk) and the message boards of the same trading platforms with messages of revenge and threats of class action.</p>
<p>The chaos generated by the deflation of the stock, which reached $ 38.50 in February, combined with heavy accusations of collusion and financial manipulation, forced the American Congress to request a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/business/gamestop-hearing.html?">hearing on the matter</a> in which all the actors in question were called to testify, including Youtuber “Roaring Kitty” Gill. Starting from the hearing, the stock has regained ground and between the end of February and the beginning of March it touched up the $ 350 in a tight growth without hint of a slowdown (a symptom that the squeeze is still in progress), so much so as to force operators on the other part of the market (the shorters) to use whatever means at their disposal to stop the price surge (<em>ladder attacks, naked short selling, married puts, synthetic longs, discardable deep in the money calls, dark pools</em>, etc. are all tactics existing that it is only possible to speculate have been implemented as they are of dubious legality and there is no certain evidence of their use). The stock's value plummeted again in late March to $ 120 and at the time of this analysis it is hovering between $ 140-160.</p>
<p>The question that arises spontaneously is whether and in what way this saga can be relevant for a broader macro-economic discourse. The stock has now stopped moving in parallel with the company and the extremely positive news that is perceived of an imminent transformation (starting with the appointment of the new board of directors). Today the stock seems at the mercy of far more powerful forces, even higher than the power of Hedge Funds who would like to see it collapse completely. The forces in question represent the real tip of the balance in an attempt to prevent the dreaded systemic failure. The work of these forces would also coincide with the most important and violent interference of the American legislator in the affairs of the free market while these are still in progress, with all due respect to the "invisible hand" of Adam Smith.</p>
<h1>Change of course or change of the rules of the game?</h1>
<p>At the top of the American market sits an independent government agency completely disconnected from the traditional executive, acting under the aegis of special statutes and accountable for its work in Congress, which can request ad hoc hearings and appoints the top. The agency in question is the SEC, established in the 1930s following the Collapse of '29 and the subsequent Great Depression. The work of the SEC is supported at system level (not by statute) by the Depository Trust &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a private company that provides clearing and settlement services to the financial market, or which acts as an arbiter of all transactions financial statements so that these are respected and all the suspended ones are covered up to the point of establishing themselves as the "ultimate guarantor" in order to ensure compliance with each transaction. Established in 1999 with the function of integrating the work of the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), DTCC is now ranked among the top 500 companies in the world by Fortune magazine.</p>
<p>These entities have repeatedly found themselves embroiled in thorny litigation, receiving heavy accusations from small listed companies and legal offices for having constantly closed their eyes to the work of Hedge Funds in the field of <em>Naked Short Selling</em>. To the harsh criticism, the DTCC has always responded that the problem was not so extensive as to warrant regulation and, while the SEC acknowledges the existence of the problem, it has in turn always supported the DTCC in case of legal proceedings.</p>
<p>The GameStop case is changing the rules of the game en passant, or at least causing this change of course. Since the request for a hearing by Congress, the SEC and the DTCC have had multiple meetings behind closed doors to address the problem and find a solution that reduces the systemic risk of default. To date, the DTCC has produced important legislative changes to the procedures in place, with particular attention to the issues of <em>failure to deliver</em> (FTD, i.e. the impossibility of repaying a debt, honouring a contract or returning a previously loaned security) and Naked Short Selling. As can be seen from the following graph on the <a href="https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=GME">SEC website</a>, the FTD against the GME stock is now standard and, as later documented by Bloomberg in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/sec-data-show-359-million-of-gamestop-shares-failed-to-deliver">spicy article on the subject</a>, over 358 million dollars in shares in January 2021 were not returned resulting in FTD.</p>
<p>https://www.futurimagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sindaco8.jpg</p>
<p>Clearly, <a href="https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/penalty-for-failure-to-deliver-common-stock">fines are foreseen if FTD is incurred</a>, but by now it seems that Hedge Funds prefer to incorporate the latter as a "management cost" to stay in business rather than worrying about acting according to the law and avoiding the infringement: the reward, obviously , is exponentially more attractive than any fine to be paid. To this distortion, the DTCC responded last March with a <a href="[https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/86649/dtcc-proposes-three-point-plan-for-derivatives-trade-reporting-data-harmonisation">plan</a> for the harmonization of data communication concerning derivatives and numerous <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings">new rules</a> are awaiting implementation that tighten the circle around the derivatives sector and the work of the most reckless. financial actors.</p>
<p>These new rules seem to demonstrate that the DTCC is clearly aware of the distortions initially considered "irrelevant" or "little branched" in the system; moreover, since DTCC is a private company, it knows very well that it is the ultimate guarantor of all financial transactions on the American market; ergo knows very well that in the event of a short squeeze and possible bankruptcy of large financial actors, a nefarious domino effect would be triggered which would lead to a series of insurance liquidations and margin calls (i.e. the forced liquidation of the entire investment portfolio of a debtor to ensure that the creditor can recover the capital lent totally or partially) as happened to the Lehman Brothers bank and to the AIG insurance company in 2008, which in the event of default would see the DTCC forced to stand as the last "debtor" towards the market (since precisely the ultimate guarantor).</p>
<h1>The Archegos case: has the domino effect already begun?</h1>
<p>Awareness of the excessive systemic risk caused by the overexposure of large financial players is convincing the DTCC and SEC to work together to ensure that from a legislative point of view they are not ultimately footing the bill for what could be the largest party. expensive in the history of American and world finance. But time is running out.</p>
<p>The recent bankruptcy of the American fund Archegos Capital Management has exposed the risks of the investment banking and shadow banking sector. When Archegos found himself unable to respond to margin call requests from his creditors at the end of the first quarter, all he had to do was declare bankruptcy. Where does the international media apprehension about the affair derive from? From the fact that Archegos has recorded the largest loss by a single company or fund since the days of Lehman Brothers: 20 billion dollars in two days. [Operators such as Credit Suisse](<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/credit-suisse-tightens-hedge-fund-limits-amid-archegos-fallout">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/credit-suisse-tightens-hedge-fund-limits-amid-archegos-fallout</a> and Nomura, overexposed in the granting of loans to Archegos, had to record exorbitant losses at the end of the first quarter and suffered a further double blow with the loss of ground on the stock exchange of their respective stocks (11% and 14%) and with the loss of important capital by other large investors who preferred to migrate their liquidity to safer and less stormy shores (in the most classic of panic runs).</p>
<p>What is worrying is not only the colossal loss generated by the Archegos bankruptcy, the turmoil caused in the market by the forced sale of the shares held by Archegos and used as collateral payment to creditors, and the concatenating losses of investment banks such as Credit Suisse and Nomura; what worries further is that a fund sponsored by the major Wall Street and international brokers (GoldmanSachs, JPMorgan, Nomura and Credit Suisse) was almost non-existent in the SEC's EDGAR database (<em>Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval</em>), or the inherent data collection public disclosure of financial transactions. The DTCC and SEC are hard at work trying to change the rules of the game in an attempt to protect the system (and themselves) from the excessive risks that the Archegos case has laid bare.</p>
<h1>Conclusions: The Game Stops?</h1>
<p>On the one hand we have the frenzied race against time of the institutions to change the legislative fabric so that the system is more protected and can better absorb bankruptcies of the size of the Archegos fund should they unexpectedly reappear (and given the low propensity to disclose information, it is expected that such bankruptcies continue to occur "without notice"); on the other hand we have the GameStop case which shows no signs of deflating and still seems to be positioned for a [<em>violent Short Squeeze</em>](<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html</a> (the Melvin Capital fund declared losses equal to 49% of its capital at the end of the first quarter).</p>
<p>The next two months will be among the hottest ever for the stock, all investors (on both sides of the market) and supervisory agencies. What is most worrying at the moment is the possible result of an uncontrolled squeeze, a scenario that we hope the institutions are considering in order to create a legislative structure around it that can support the pressure and defuse the risk of a systemic crisis. It goes without saying that the investors who back GameStop and aim for the squeeze (because they are fans of the company, because they are mere speculators, or because of a desire for revenge against Wall Street) are looking forward to seeing the stock fly on the stock market and see it fail and declare bankruptcy. Hedge Funds that bet against them. However romantic the happy ending of David defeating the financial Goliath of our times is, it is important to understand the repercussions of a possible fall of these funds on the global financial fabric and how to organize the chessboard so that the system comes out unscathed whatever it is. the outcome of the dispute.</p>
<p>What DTCC and SEC are trying to understand is how to stem a 2008 crisis-style domino effect, where a hedge fund's margin call could result not only in its bankruptcy but in an excessive loss of capital for its creditors as well (banks of investment) and the insurance institutions that act as guarantors of the operations. And given the risk balancing practice that sees banks exchanging Credit Default Swaps and insurance companies do the same, these "protective" practices against a possible collapse of one of the parties would act as a true link and common thread that could trigger the downfall of all. the domino pieces. More margin calls, more bankruptcies of funds, credit institutions and insurance companies would trigger a financial crisis greater in size than those of the subprime (2008), the Nasdaq(2000) and the Great Depression (1929) with the financial panic that would ensue, branching off in a widespread manner and seriously affecting all sectors of the economy, including households and savings. We would see the fastest collapse in the history of financial indices given the large number of existing online trading platforms; assets considered as a store of value such as gold, silver, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies would generally experience unprecedented exponential growth (also placing these markets at bubble risk, but that's another topic). The short squeeze of GME stock could be the catalyst of the crisis and DTCC and SEC are extremely aware of the situation.</p>
<p>Creating a legislative structure around the squeeze is the only conceivable solution at the moment, considering that the company's official shares are about 70 million and that the total number in the market is much higher (although not officially quantifiable) in the form of synthetic shares (final product of the practice of Naked Short Selling), making the squeeze difficult to avoid. And time is running out, as GameStop has announced its annual shareholders' meeting for June 9th and the recount of the shares will start from the sixtieth day before the meeting, and the feeling is that starting from this date there will be a sort of curfew and all overdrafts must be covered and the shares re-entered for the counting officer.</p>
<p>Archegos served as an alarm bell for the system to wake up and act to protect itself; GameStop is adding momentum for this to happen quickly. As outside observers, we are confident that the agencies involved will be able to untie the Gordian knot and ensure the security of the system. Our conviction derives from the awareness that these agencies are extremely resilient and when their very survival is put at risk they pull out their claws and there is no outside interest that cares: only their survival counts; luckily, their survival to date is directly linked to ours and that of the global financial system.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Bitcoin and stock market are inflated, liquidity problems, possible crash connected to GME.</p>
