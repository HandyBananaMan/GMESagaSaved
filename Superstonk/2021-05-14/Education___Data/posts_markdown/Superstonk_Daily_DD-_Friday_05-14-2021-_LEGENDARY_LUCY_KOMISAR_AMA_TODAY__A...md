Lucy has been covering financial and corporate corruption for decades, mainly through her online paper, [The Komisar Scoop.](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/) And the first time I spoke to Dr. T, and I told her how much I respected her not only as an OG ape, but as a badass feminist icon... (lowkey, I hate to even bring up gender here but it can't be dismissed...) she chuckled her warm chuckle and told me who she looks up to, and said "if you want a real icon... you all should talk to Lucy Komisar." That made me feel like I had been blessed by the lips of God... an icon that our icon looks up to? Sign us up! So in the whirlwind of AMAs that our mod team has managed to schedule and put together, (BIG thank you goes to u/StonkU2 for coordinating these connections!! 🙏🙏) we have managed to not only bring you the magnificent Lucy Komisar....

# [....But also next Tuesday we have Attorney Wes Christian](http://www.csj-law.com/attorneys/jchristian.html)!!

# His primary focus in the last 11 years has been suing Wall Street for fraud.

&#x200B;

Wes Christian is a Texas attorney with [an accent as big as his list of accomplishments](http://www.csj-law.com/attorneys/jchristian.html)! Once again I'm going to [shamelessly plug the old documentary Wall Street Conspiracy](https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU), where I first learned of Wes Christian along with all of the other OGs we've been talking to. And a fun fact... our former AMA guest and very favorite resident wrinkly brain, u/dlauer has served as an expert witness for Wes multiple times in the fight against naked short selling. They go way back...

# Which is why we're having u/Dlauer cohost this AMA with his old pal Wes!! We are literally assembling the dream team here!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[^(did I mention Dave Lauer is one of us)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/naoqr9/bought_some_gme_yesterday/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)^(?)

**The Wes Christian/Dlauer mashup AMA is next Tuesday, May 18 at 4:30 pm Eastern!!**

&#x200B;

[Wes Christian](https://preview.redd.it/u05nr3qojyy61.png?width=170&format=png&auto=webp&s=abd5426cf404b8b982d5289df625a5e24059cd3c)

**Here's what Dr. T has to say about how she first met Wes in her book, Naked Short and Greedy:**

**Chapter 3**: A Sidewalk Café in New York. At the request of a business colleague, I have coffee with a lawyer from Texas who tells me that a problem was about to blow up the financial markets: Wall Street brokers are using short sales and fails to deliver to grab the assets of American entrepreneurs. I feel a pang of guilt for not sticking it out to fix this before I left DTC in 1993. By 2003, it was a full-blown regulatory crisis!

&#x200B;

**The Napkin Story**

*"One afternoon \[in late 2003\], my boss tells me he has just come from lunch with an old friend, Gary Jewell, a Houston-based lawyer. Gary said that he was in New York looking for someone who understands post-trade clearing and settlement, possibly someone who may have worked at the DTC. My boss recognizes the company name as part of my past work experience. He asks me to meet Gary over coffee. The two of them had run marathons in their younger days and my boss presents it to me as doing him a favor. Gary brought Wes Christian to that casual meeting.*

*James "Wes" Christian, is a Senior Partner at Christian, Smith, & Jewell in Houston. If not for Wes, I may not ever have become aware that the crack in the system Ray Riley brought to me in 1993 was becoming a gaping chasm in 2003. Wes was born, raised, and educated in Texas. He comes complete with a pleasant drawl that belies his non-nonsense approach to the matter. Wes would lead a team of 65 lawyers as he eventually uncovered more than 1,200 hedge fund and offshore accounts working through more than 150 broker-dealers to strip mall and medium size public companies of their value."*\- Dr. Susanne Trimbath, Naked Short and Greedy.

We are so honored, humbled, and thrilled to bring you these top-tier AMA guests! If only we could go back and tell our February selves how far we've come 💖

# Gamestop deleted their MOASS tweets, but I think Ryan Cohen told us what we need to know

*Insert opinion flair here* 👽

Alright, some of you may think I'm wearing a tin foil hat here, that's fine. You can call all this a totally trippin Pink Cats theory... But I want to talk a little more about the Ryan Cohen tweet from Wednesday night.

[RC was right by the SEC HQ on Wednesday night](https://preview.redd.it/a93vfyiy0zy61.jpg?width=2033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0b1e6eaaedbcb3678d1d4f465a40804805e100a)

Yesterday I pointed out that RC was at a Gamestop *thrillingly* close to the SEC HQ. And we know he doesn't really just take pictures at any ol' gamestop (remember when he was 15 minutes away from Elon Musk, who was also in town?) We know our favorite corporate memelord loves to speak in riddle through twitter, so I think he is *extremely strategic* about "dropping a GME pin" for us to figure out what's going on.

&#x200B;

So yesterday I also pointed out that the **SEC SEEMS TO HAVE FINALLY HELD THE MOTHERFUDING SUNSHINE ACT MEETING AFTER 4 POSTPONEMENTS....**

[DID IT HAPPEN OR NOT?!](https://preview.redd.it/jr6qhlkf4zy61.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4e198431d5b4e182d54244fd4f65ac5aa902ab1)

I can't find confirmation anywhere that the meeting *did* happen for sure, but it wasn't postponed, which I'm pretty sure would have to be posted on their website in a timely manner, so for the sake of this story we're gonna say it DID happen yesterday. Which would be a *HUGE* deal because this thing has been postponed **4 TIMES** in the last few months. Let's look at the topics they discussed:

&#x200B;

* injunctive actions-  Definition: An **injunction** is a court order requiring a person to do or cease doing a specific **action**.
* administrative proceedings- refers to [this](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.htm)
* litigation claims- more court case discussions, sounds like they're resolving some open court battles (for the record I think this is a recurring agenda item, as is everything else.)
* Other matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings- this sounds like the blanket, open-ended term used at the end of most government entity agendas that allows for fairly open discussion... though I could be wrong. Maybe they're going heavy on the examinations and enforcements? 👉👈

&#x200B;

Not really any meat here. It seems to be a pretty high stakes meeting though, given the heavy topics like litigation. But it *does* sounds like the kind of meeting someone would want to go to if you want to prove naked short sellers are attacking your company.

[Edit: another Sunshine Act Meeting has been scheduled for next week.](https://www.sec.gov/news/upcoming-events/closed-meeting-052021)

👽THEORY INCOMING👽

I think RC let us know he was there in Virginia at that Gamestop because of course we're going to do the thing we did and look around it on Maps.

.**..And find that he's right by the SEC HQ....**

The night before a **HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MEETING THAT HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY POSTPONED UNTIL NOW**\- which I honestly think is to let RC & co get their proxy affairs in order and present their case.

# REMEMBER THE ACTIONABLE DATA FROM THE LIVE, REAL-TIME PROXY REPORT THAT GAMESTOP NOW HAS ACCESS TO?

RC would have gotten the proxy results on May 11 and had them in hand for the meeting yesterday.  He wanted us to know he was in attendance of the SEC meeting. He can't tell us. He know's we're watching and holding our collective breath, waiting for the banana to drop. But he can't be too obvious for obvious reasons. By telling us in this way, he's just a suit promoting his brand (who really knows his customers! 😉 )

# [Please read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/naw85p/proxy_voting_dd_v2_why_gamestop_is_publicly/) by [u/TheGargaglione](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGargaglione/) that explains perfectly why I believe RC was at the meeting, with Proxy vote numbers in hand, which is the evidence the SEC would need to start an investigation.

[It's ok we have screenshots 👁👅👁📷](https://preview.redd.it/aqzj26vd0zy61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=70d91c52b80ddc5f0124ba9287ad67b1592e693b)

&#x200B;

# ALL OF THIS ALSO EXPLAINS THE EXTREME CONFIDENCE GAMESTOP HAD IN TWEETING MOASS

Which they deleted :(

But, in all the cool spy movies, the message always self destructs after the intended party reads it ;) (Apes copy, Houston. Over.)

**From the desk of** u/dlauer\*\*:\*\*

# GME Depth of Book

"I've seen the screenshot of GME with all those 1 share orders, and just wanted to reiterate that you need to know what the source is of the market data. Here is what Fidelity looks like - clearly a full book across many exchanges without those 1 share orders. Always think about the source of the data - standard retail data is low quality, and usually only from 1 exchange."

[The order books on your broker are probably a lie](https://preview.redd.it/n507hmy9ezy61.png?width=319&format=png&auto=webp&s=de631f5b1cb834f915808fa4d3addd9eab68f7d8)

**TA;DR: The order books ARE more voluminous than we can see on our retail level 2 data.**

# Yo I heard you like math and confirmation bias (but mostly the 2nd one so I did the math part)

[**u/Dwellerofthecrags**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dwellerofthecrags/) **posted** [**this post and pointed this out**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbku8x/if_fidelity_transferees_own_19_shares_each_theyd/)

https://preview.redd.it/nzv163w4gzy61.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=d434ba70c3e50e4a2dc6e0ff134b0aa23ac5ad5e

* 4.1 Million new accounts switched to Fidelity in the first quarter of 2021.
* GME float is 47.75 Million held by retail, 69.75 total
* 69.75/4=17.43
* 47.75/4.1=11.65

So, what's the maths?

Well, assuming there are 47.75 Million available shares for retail to buy (float), **IF THE 4.1 MILLION NEW FIDELITY CUSTOMERS ALONE own at least 11.65 shares each, THEN THEY OWN THE FLOAT.**

Being generous and saying if there were 69.75 Million shares available for retail to buy (there aren't), and the **4.1 MILLION NEW FIDELITY CUSTOMERS ALONE own at least 17.43 shares each, THEN THEY OWN THE FLOAT.**

DID YOU HEAR ME? That's just those new 4.1 Million fidelity customers. And as you're well aware, many of us have high xx, xxx, xxxx and beyond.

# A note from your friendly local Pink Cat 🐈

I want to say how proud I am of this community! The momentum has picked up, our bias has officially been confirmed, we know this is a matter of *wen* we moon, not if... all thanks to the overwhelming growth we've seen in the last couple of weeks and our amazing mod team. This is real, and you should feel confident in that as you peruse the sub, or as you interact with the people in your everyday life. *The only way the shorts get out of this like they always do, is by driving the company to bankruptcy like they always do.* **And don't forget that GME paid off all its long term debt a couple weeks ago.** Bankruptcy is *completely* off the table. In this unique scenario where we have the turnaround of a company with a dream team board of directors, the real unique situation here is THE APES ON REDDIT WITH DIAMOND HANDS.

Do **NOT** forget where we came from. 💎🙌🚀 That's what got us here, and that's what will take us to Valhalla. Trust the company's plan and HODL. The professionals we are bringing on for AMAs are providing invaluable confirmation and validity to our sub and to apes (and ants!) everywhere. **The heart and energy of this sub is quite literally the catalyst.** By you buying a stock in a company you believe in, HODLing with diamond hands, and **VOTING YOUR SHARES**, you are literally creating the MOASS.

&#x200B;

**Do you understand that?**

&#x200B;

# 🚀APES ARE THE CATALYST🚀VOTING IS THE CATALYST🚀

&#x200B;

**BUY. HODL. VOTE.**

&#x200B;

The catalyst really has been inside us the whole time. ✌

&#x200B;

**No date or meeting or rule or new CEO or merger or margin call or ANY OF THIS WOULD EVEN EXIST IF IT WEREN'T FOR DIAMOND HANDS. 💎🙌 WE ARE THE CATALYST!! VOTE!!**
