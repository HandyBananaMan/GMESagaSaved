(After the peak) If your floor isn\u2019t AT LEAST 10 million, you need to get some shit straight.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are only holding for the X apes, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re only holding until the last second to just become a millionaire. IT DOESN\u2019T MATTER!\n\nInstead of only taking what you feel that you deserve, take MORE than what you deserve and DONATE IT. Being greedy doesn\u2019t always have to be about YOU! It can be about being greedy for your family, your friends, the people who love you. Give back to your teachers who inspired you, the community that raised you, the hospitals that nursed you. GIVE BACK. Be GREEDY AS FUCK SO YOU CAN GIVE BACK. \n\nAlso, if there are any apes who want to talk with others who are like minded, my DMs are open. I understand that it\u2019s difficult feeling like you\u2019re the only one who knows what\u2019s going on. We will need each other more than ever during the MOASS. Find a trusted ape buddy to talk to and set your heart straight!\n\nI love you all. \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: had a few DMs come in and you guys are awesome. Keep em coming! I\u2019ve got nothing to do but enjoy life :)",
