<p>During Lucy Komisar's AMA, she mentioned that US law allows a maximum rehypothecation of 140% for short selling borrowed shares. Maybe many of you already knew this fact, but it was the first time I had heard of it.</p>
<p>So I looked it up:<br />
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp</p>
<p>"In the United States, rehypothecation of collateral by broker-dealers is limited to 140% of the loan amount to a client, under Rule 15c3-3 of the SEC."</p>
<p>When I hear 140%, I immediately think of the reported short interest before the gamma squeeze in Jan. Is this a coincidence or was it 140% because that is the max they can show by law?</p>
<p>Does this mean it could have possibly been even greater than 140% even back in Jan, but they couldn't report more than 140% and had to hide the rest in married puts, etc like they do now?</p>
