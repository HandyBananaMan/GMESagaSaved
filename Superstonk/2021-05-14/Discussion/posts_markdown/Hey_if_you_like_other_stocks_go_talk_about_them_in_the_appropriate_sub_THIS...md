Edit2: Thank you mods whether you saw this or not for cleaning up front page. Much appreciated!!

Edit: Lets make it clear - I have no issues with your stock sir. You are just in the wrong place talking about it

Its pretty clear this is the next shill tactic or you guys cant follow rules to make the mods job easier... THIS IS GME ONLY SUB SINCE DAY 1..... why are certain stocks allowed and talked about in any way shape or form here. We have known since jan about the distraction stocks/trades. why is it ok now when we are coming to  D-Day.... And when you call it out they say " ape no fight ape" bruh..... are you guys kidding me..

Mods stop sleeping and step it up... Rules are there for a reason..you made them... enforce them
