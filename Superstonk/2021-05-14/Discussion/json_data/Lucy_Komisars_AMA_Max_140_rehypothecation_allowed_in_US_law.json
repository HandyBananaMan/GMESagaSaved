    "selftext": "During Lucy Komisar's AMA, she mentioned that US law allows a maximum rehypothecation of 140% for short selling borrowed shares. Maybe many of you already knew this fact, but it was the first time I had heard of it.\n\nSo I looked it up:  \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp\n\n\"In the United States, rehypothecation of collateral by broker-dealers is limited to 140% of the loan amount to a client, under Rule 15c3-3 of the SEC.\"\n\nWhen I hear 140%, I immediately think of the reported short interest before the gamma squeeze in Jan. Is this a coincidence or was it 140% because that is the max they can show by law?\n\nDoes this mean it could have possibly been even greater than 140% even back in Jan, but they couldn't report more than 140% and had to hide the rest in married puts, etc like they do now?",
