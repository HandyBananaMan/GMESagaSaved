Reading the new god tier DD this morning on Citadel using it\u2019s MM abilities to synthetically short GME got me thinking. As we all know, GameStop raised capital through an offering of 3.5 million shares a few weeks ago. I think the price they sold at was around 150, in essence raising the $525 million we all heard about. However, what if (as we all suspect) citadel has been using their MM abilities to synthetically suppress the price of GME and the offering price should have been 4-5x higher (600-750)? And what if GameStop can prove that accusation based on the proxy votes being far in excess of the float? Then in essence, GameStop potentially has been defrauded financially by Citadel, and as a result could file suit for damages ($$$$$). \n\n(Pure speculation here) Is that potentially why Ryan Cohen was in VA near SEC HQ the other day AFTER GameStop Twitter account was freely tweeting about MOASS? Is he giving the SEC the heads up on what is coming?",
