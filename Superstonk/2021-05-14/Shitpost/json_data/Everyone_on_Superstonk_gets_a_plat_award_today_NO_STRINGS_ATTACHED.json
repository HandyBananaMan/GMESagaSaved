SO...\n\nI'm handing out **rehypothecated plat awards** to **everyone** who posts on r/Superstonk today!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo strings attached. Just **comment somewhere on the sub** at some point today.\n\nObviously this is a big **time commitment from me**, but I'm doing it because **I love this community.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you can't see the plat award, don't worry... it's there. It's just short. **I promise to deliver** down the line.\n\nAlso, also! **Feel free** to **rehypothecate your** **awards** you get from me. This will go down as reddit's **most generous day ever** and **literally can't go tits up!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** After 30 minutes, plat SI% is **42.0%**. We're fine.\n\n**Edit 2:** After 45 minutes, plat SI% is **690%**. Give me a minute.\n\n**Edit 3:** After 46 minutes, plat SI% is back down to **6.9%**. Carry on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 4:** Four hours in, and all these drones are freaking me out. I'm keeping the lights on all night, just in case.\n\n**Edit 5:** Six hours in, and I'm totally not funneling all-seeing eyes through the Caymans with my friends. The end is totally not nigh. No way this goes tits up.\n\n**Edit 6:** Eight hours. Unplugged the phone. Go away, Marge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 7: Final Edit**\n\nThis is Agent Smith of the **Platinum Exchange Coin Registrar**. On behalf of **PECR**, I need to inform you that u/Apprehensive-Salt-42 has been shut down, and his **platinum seized.**\n\nu/Apprehensive-Salt-42 was found in violation of several, albeit **small, PECR** **regulations**. The investigation is still ongoing, so we will not comment further beyond saying:\n\n# Buy, HODL, Vote, and don't engage with small PECRs.\n\n\\-Agent Smith, Big Swinging PECR",
