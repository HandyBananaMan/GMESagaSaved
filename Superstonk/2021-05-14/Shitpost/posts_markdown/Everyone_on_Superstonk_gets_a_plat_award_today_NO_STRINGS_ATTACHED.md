# Fellow Apes!

I've figured out a plan and it **literally can't go tits up.**

# Someone gave me a plat award! SO...

I'm handing out **rehypothecated plat awards** to **everyone** who posts on r/Superstonk today!!

&#x200B;

No strings attached. Just **comment somewhere on the sub** at some point today.

Obviously this is a big **time commitment from me**, but I'm doing it because **I love this community.**

&#x200B;

Also, if you can't see the plat award, don't worry... it's there. It's just short. **I promise to deliver** down the line.

Also, also! **Feel free** to **rehypothecate your** **awards** you get from me. This will go down as reddit's **most generous day ever** and **literally can't go tits up!**

**Edit 1:** After 30 minutes, plat SI% is **42.0%**. We're fine.

**Edit 2:** After 45 minutes, plat SI% is **690%**. Give me a minute.

**Edit 3:** After 46 minutes, plat SI% is back down to **6.9%**. Carry on.

&#x200B;

**Edit 4:** Four hours in, and all these drones are freaking me out. I'm keeping the lights on all night, just in case.

**Edit 5:** Six hours in, and I'm totally not funneling all-seeing eyes through the Caymans with my friends. The end is totally not nigh. No way this goes tits up.

**Edit 6:** Eight hours. Unplugged the phone. Go away, Marge.

**Edit 7: Final Edit**

This is Agent Smith of the **Platinum Exchange Coin Registrar**. On behalf of **PECR**, I need to inform you that u/Apprehensive-Salt-42 has been shut down, and his **platinum seized.**

u/Apprehensive-Salt-42 was found in violation of several, albeit **small, PECR** **regulations**. The investigation is still ongoing, so we will not comment further beyond saying:
