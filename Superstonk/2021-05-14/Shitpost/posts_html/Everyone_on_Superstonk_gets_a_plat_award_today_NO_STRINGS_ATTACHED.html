<h1>Fellow Apes!</h1>
<p>I've figured out a plan and it <strong>literally can't go tits up.</strong></p>
<h1>Someone gave me a plat award! SO...</h1>
<p>I'm handing out <strong>rehypothecated plat awards</strong> to <strong>everyone</strong> who posts on r/Superstonk today!!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>No strings attached. Just <strong>comment somewhere on the sub</strong> at some point today.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a big <strong>time commitment from me</strong>, but I'm doing it because <strong>I love this community.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, if you can't see the plat award, don't worry... it's there. It's just short. <strong>I promise to deliver</strong> down the line.</p>
<p>Also, also! <strong>Feel free</strong> to <strong>rehypothecate your</strong> <strong>awards</strong> you get from me. This will go down as reddit's <strong>most generous day ever</strong> and <strong>literally can't go tits up!</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> After 30 minutes, plat SI% is <strong>42.0%</strong>. We're fine.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> After 45 minutes, plat SI% is <strong>690%</strong>. Give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> After 46 minutes, plat SI% is back down to <strong>6.9%</strong>. Carry on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Four hours in, and all these drones are freaking me out. I'm keeping the lights on all night, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 5:</strong> Six hours in, and I'm totally not funneling all-seeing eyes through the Caymans with my friends. The end is totally not nigh. No way this goes tits up.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong> Eight hours. Unplugged the phone. Go away, Marge.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Edit 7: Final Edit</strong></p>
<p>This is Agent Smith of the <strong>Platinum Exchange Coin Registrar</strong>. On behalf of <strong>PECR</strong>, I need to inform you that u/Apprehensive-Salt-42 has been shut down, and his <strong>platinum seized.</strong></p>
<p>u/Apprehensive-Salt-42 was found in violation of several, albeit <strong>small, PECR</strong> <strong>regulations</strong>. The investigation is still ongoing, so we will not comment further beyond saying:</p>
