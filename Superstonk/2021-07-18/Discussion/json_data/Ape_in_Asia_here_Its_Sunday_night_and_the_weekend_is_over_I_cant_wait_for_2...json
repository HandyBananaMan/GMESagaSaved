    "selftext": "Normally, Kenny would just kick the can down the road, but he didn't. He can't. DCT 005 stopped him. He now has 43 million uncollateralized short positions (just from Friday alone) that will pop-up on his books come Monday. Remember that NSCC 002 created Auto-Marge, so unless the drop to $165 was enough to bring his debt/equity ratio down far enough for Marge, Monday is going to suck... for him or us, I don't know.   \n  \nI still haven't been able to find anyone who knows for sure. Lots of speculation and guesses. Will he dig himself deeper and short the shit out of GME on Monday, or will Auto-Marge come in like the terminator and give him one hour to live.   \n  \nThank god the weekend is over.",
