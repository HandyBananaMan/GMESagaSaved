Hi everyone, Bob here.

I am writing you today to bring you some updates to some of the things I'm tracking in an effort to predict possible movements in my favorite fucking stock in the world: GME.

# My Current Thesis

https://preview.redd.it/ujckg80uv1c71.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a382a335a4f05de78e23b7bb4da0599aec338bf

Essentially, I'm seeing a pattern that began with a ~~T +35~~ \*\*c+35 (for calendar days)\*\*FTD cycle on 8/21/2020 when RC bought in and bent over the shorts.  Then, the shorts played their games kicking the can until things spun out of control in January 2021.  At that point, they sprinkled in some crime and started playing shell games with ETFs and hiding the bulk of their FTDs in options.  Over the next 6 months (so far) they continued to aggressively short the stock to avoid margin calls and liquidation, and that continues to this day.  This shorting activity only adds to the over-extended position they are in, further cementing their fate.  They will eventually run out of margin as the walls close in around them and the other financial institutions step up to the plate to divide their carcass.  When will this happen? I don't know, but until then, I will be tracking the many moving parts of this saga in an effort to both keep an eye on further fuckery developing, and help find the patterns as they develop.

**Here's the things I'm tracking to date:**

Bolded items are new from the [Original DD that began this combination of ideas process](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o32geb/update_on_t21_cycles_and_dd_on_dd_by_ucriand_and/), and all data is updated as of the last release of information from [Finra](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm).

* FTDs and C+35 Cycles
   * **Broken out by GME and ETFs (weighted)**
* Major option chain expirations and their C+35 into T+21 â™¾ loop (liquidity cycle)
* Supplemental Liquidity Deposits (SLDs)
* **Threshold Securities Lists**
* **Volume & Daily FTDs**

OK first, up, I had a look at my favorite indicator of potential movement since the January sneeze: **Options activity**.  Specifically potential married puts.  What's a married put you say? Well, one of my favorite great apes, u/broccaaa will tell you!  [The DD here is a bit old, but still very valid to today's fuckery and situation with options hiding FTDs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/)

# A look at Options

The working theory here is the same as the last post.  Since January (and possibly before) shorts have been hiding their FTDs through options trickery.  I've identified several dates that I'm seeing this activity and have tracked/extrapolated the C+35 delivery dates as well as the infinite loop liquidity T+21 snowball (which some smarter apes in discord have pointed out is likely a combination of T+10 and subsequent T+12 cycle for delivery requirements of different entities involved in the option chain/ftd cycles).

![Options I'm tracking .  Volume is only selecting likely strikes that are being abused to hide FTDs](https://preview.redd.it/ntchvaoer1c71.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=d266c9edcaa2a04691f904563a2a4e2b6e27a9e3)

**I'm color coding the list to match the crayons below so you can see the data and a visual more clearly and hopefully connect some dots.**

![T+35 options tracking](https://preview.redd.it/1tcqjum1w1c71.png?width=2577&format=png&auto=webp&s=c09d8024165e91d7b686f5710405c0c19a21e64f)

C+35 seems to line up pretty nicely with *all* of the bumps this year so far after the big Sneeze of January 2021.  But what about the ones that don't?

* 4/1/2021 - 4/16/2021: [First ATM offering](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program)
* 5/6/2021:  I'm not sure - maybe a volume issue?
* 5/14/2021: This looks like it might have been omitted from my original blue group.  I'll attribute this one to the start of the runup in May.
* 6/25/2021 : [Second ATM Offering](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program-0)

So that accounts for 100% of the option cycles I've identified so far.  Looks like a pattern to me, with maybe that 1 exception.  Apes, and wrinkles, let me know if you have any thoughts on this.  I'd love to figure out the outlier and potentially look to the future what we can see/predict.

# On to FTDs

When looking at FTDs, I can't thank u/dentisttft enough.  That ~~man~~ ape is a true silverback in wrinkles *and* attitude - and my wife likes him better than she likes me!  Her boyfriend better watch out!

Here's some crayons to munch on.  Explanation comes after.

https://preview.redd.it/rcb0jndvz1c71.png?width=2589&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa800180abf3b5084cf223adfaa0cd57f70d23ca

So, what I'm seeing here is pretty interesting.  The FTDs look like they seem to fall off a bit on impacting the price after the January sneeze is complete and their resultant metric butt-ton of FTDs complete their C+35 cycle (likely the major mover for the February runup, alongside some options activity as well).  This plays well to my theory that the game they (the sHFs) were playing c**hanged in January from FTDs to Options and crime**.

But let's see what it looks like further back to test this theory, shall we?

![the OG FTD cycle](https://preview.redd.it/2nfb4fpb12c71.png?width=2573&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f4bacb6ebfebf52e1db08f964c55d3f737ec8e)

Now, check this shit out... if you follow the cycle, it lines up with **every fucking bounce** perfectly until the January sneeze....

&#x200B;

![go back and check the dates for these bounces, you'll see the cycle for yourself.](https://preview.redd.it/a8dgry2jn2c71.png?width=203&format=png&auto=webp&s=facf5b5942c316eb6f64b754ec849b53dee55bb1)

I did extrapolate this out past Jan and the correlation seems to stop there.  I think this is why u/gafgarian seems to have given up on the FTD cycle as a thing (and I don't blame him).  It's not the primary mover since the sneeze because the game has changed since then.  [Here's his original DD in PDF form](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/854757019830190083/857718719815876618/GMEv15.pdf) (not sure if that link works - please let me know)

# About Supplemental Liquidity Deposits

So... since the update to the rules (I can't fucking remember which one right now... 002? 005? whatever).  The SRO (Self Regulatory Organizations) that ~~enforce the rules~~ enable this bullshit game to continue can call on their participants at any time, and they will have to satisfy their margin requirements *within the hour*.  That's great!  Guess what? The monthly cycle where it's mandated is also still in effect, so I thought what better way to visualize the impact of this, and all things potentially affecting the volatility and/or upwards (because i want my fucking tendies) price movement would be to reduce them to binary factors.  Here we go....

Eyeball correlations incoming (will run stats later because I'm lazy and have been busy AF with RL obligations). Also, to any stats ape that wants to, I have a [data drive here you can easily access all my data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/6/folders/1poM5S5qaiyyLd40gWSgKdn3ONzWbgdfj)  (and data from really fucking smart apes who have contributed to the repository) and run the correlations yourself.

&#x200B;

I marked the time frames we have been using this whole post so you can see easily the correlations.

The jury is out on this at the moment because I haven't had the chance to dive in fully, I just wanted to share with the apes in hope some quant might pick this up and run an analysis on the factors I've identified here.  From a quick look, I'm seeing Options and SLDs drive price movements most consistently since January. To be continued...

# Wen Moon

We moon when we moon.  Until then, I keep buying and hodling.  Im particularly interested in this most recent option chain expiry and will keep you posted if I find anything.  The dates upcoming to watch are:

* 7/20/2021: This marks T+2 for the option expiration.  If these were fuckery options, we might some movement from the MM on or near this date.
* 7/22/2021: There is a rather large (post Sneeze) T+35 FTD due (462k shares) & the 4/16 & 10/16 option chain T+21 cycle hitting
* 7/23/2021: the T+21 infinity loop liquidity chain from 3/19
* 8/20/2021: This is the T+35 date from the option expiration.  Since January, these have been really big moves in price towards the moon.  I'm watching that day and buying some tasty fucking dip until then.

In short, I expect a runup very soon, possibly next week that could be something like we saw in May.  This time without an ATM offering to fuck it up.

**If we don't moon soon, well, I have a message to the hedgies:**
