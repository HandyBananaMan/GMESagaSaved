<h1>Title: Dear Ken. You have taken advantage of me too long. As a TOKEN of my appreciation I want you to know that you can kiss my future NFT a** goodbye. Me + GME = Free. Free from you &amp; your monopoly on retail traders. Say hello to Tokens. Goodbye Cidatel. Announcement tomorrow. Brick by Brick. ðŸš€ðŸš€</h1>

<p>GME may begin issuing Tokens soon due to the vast amount of naked shorts there are but someone else may be starting to issue tokens as early as tomorrow. I have it first hand from a very reliable source that we should be hearing an announcement tomorrow. </p>
<p>If Gary Gensler keeps amending the rules of the game to accommodate the very rich and fraudulentâ€™s, it may be time for GME to completely vacate this side of the market and start fresh on the digital side. One brick at a time. I love the stonk. Hodling.</p>
