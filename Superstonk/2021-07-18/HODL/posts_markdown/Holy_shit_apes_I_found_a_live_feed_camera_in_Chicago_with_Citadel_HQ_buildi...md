#Title: Holy shit apes, I found a live feed camera in Chicago with Citadel HQ building, and confirmed the exact position with Google Earth. The camera is sometimes moving to focus on something else but it's just a matter of time for it to get back onto the buildings. Now apes can watch Shitadel lights live
