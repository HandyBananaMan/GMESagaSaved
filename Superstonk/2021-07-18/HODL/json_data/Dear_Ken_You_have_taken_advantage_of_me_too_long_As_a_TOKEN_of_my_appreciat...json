    "selftext": "GME may begin issuing Tokens soon due to the vast amount of naked shorts there are but someone else may be starting to issue tokens as early as tomorrow. I have it first hand from a very reliable source that we should be hearing an announcement tomorrow. \n\nIf Gary Gensler keeps amending the rules of the game to accommodate the very rich and fraudulent\u2019s, it may be time for GME to completely vacate this side of the market and start fresh on the digital side. One brick at a time. I love the stonk. Hodling.",
