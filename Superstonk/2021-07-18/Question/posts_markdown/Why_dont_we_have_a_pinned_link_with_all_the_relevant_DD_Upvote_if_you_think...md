Hey Superstonk,

I don't know about you, but what do you think about having a pinned post at the top with links to all the best DD, so people don't have to go hunting around for it?

Mods, can you make this happen? It would be helpful for any new visitors to see at the top, without having to search.  It's got to be plainly obvious, so new visitors, even people who've never used reddit before, can get fast access.  Should probably be in some sort of order, I'll leave that up to the Mods/community to determine...

What do you all think?
