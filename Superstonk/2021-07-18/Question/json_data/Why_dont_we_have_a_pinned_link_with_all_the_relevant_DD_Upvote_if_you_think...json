It would be helpful for any new visitors to see at the top, without having to search.  It's got to be plainly obvious, so new visitors, even people who've never used reddit before, can get fast access.  Should probably be in some sort of order, I'll leave that up to the Mods/community to determine...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think?",
