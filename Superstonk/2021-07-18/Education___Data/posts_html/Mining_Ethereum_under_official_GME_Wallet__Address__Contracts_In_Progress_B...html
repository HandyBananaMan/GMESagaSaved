<p>I am running a total of 5 cards right now on GME and it's mining just fine with no issues.</p>

<p>I set my pool to 0.01 eth payout so hopefully we hit that soon with 5 cards mining.</p>
<p>Total of around 200+ MH/s</p>
<p>GME NFT ADDRESS FROM THE SOURCE</p>
<p>Go to GME official NFT website and use that address to link to the rest of the address / contracts.</p>
<p>Always go to the source</p>
<p>https://nft.gamestop.com</p>
<p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e</p>

<p>You can thank the insomniac in me right now.</p>
<p>I should be sleeping with my wife but instead I am mining while her boyfriend is keeping her warm.</p>
<p>I love the stock</p>
<p>I like my apes</p>
<p>This is my way!</p>

<p>Edit 8: 2nd payout hit thanks to all the Apes who participated in this test run / trial run.</p>

<p>Edit 7: That was freaky fast. Someone please get all the GPU apes some jimmy johns</p>
<p>We got a payout from Flexpool. This is why I love these guys. So freaking fast and efficient.</p>
<p>Here is the transaction from etherscan and you can get more details also under the payment tab on flex pool.</p>
<p>I am not the NFT specialist. I am just a filthy miner.</p>
<p>Someone else needs to find out if we minted a coin or not. All I know is I can mine to this address and flex pool will initiate a payment to it.</p>
<p>Here is the records. </p>
<p>Thanks again u/Shorty-Hunter</p>
<p>Thanks again all my apes for coming in clutch like you guys always do</p>
<p>As always I love the stock and I will pick up more on Monday during pre-market. See you guys on the field.</p>

<p>Edit 6: </p>
<p>I love the worker names you guys come up with. 🤪</p>
<p>I’m just super boring with my worker names.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your contributions.</p>
<p>This proves what brother ape u/Shorty-Hunter said about being able to mine using the Gamestop coin address was true and what bad mod madie said was not true.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/omijsk/update_from_the_ape_who_is_mining_ethereum_coin</p>
<p>We hit minimum payout thanks to all apes and should hopefully see a payout next time flexpool does their payments. 💰💰</p>
<p>This will let us know if they’ve updated the code to begin accepting ether into their wallet which is needed as gas / fuel to power transactions and incentivize miners to process your request.</p>
<p>Edit 5: I had to . A single RX580 has entered the battle. All hail single GPU brother APE testing for the sake of science and GME. This is the way!</p>

<p>Edit 4: You can mine too for GME if you're bored or want to learn.

<p>Edit 3: Couple more rigs showed up and now we are at 545 MH/s of power.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Looks like another ape is an insomniac too and is helping route another 200 MH/s of power our way. RISE UP APES
THIS IS NOT MY WORKER. THIS IS A NEW WORKER THAT POPPED UP 28 SECONDS AGO.</p>

<p>Edit to prep Apes for future FUD from shills</p>
<p>Everyone please keep in mind the FUD about payout reverting.</p>
<p>No one cares if it will be reverted.</p>
<p>Just the fact that I can mine against the wallet/address/contract is enough confirmation bias for me that I know I picked the right company to invest in.</p>
<p>After this weekend shit show, I plan to buy more GME badges pre-market Monday.</p>
<p>GME will be cutting edge and will make an example for everyone company to follow into the future.</p>
<p>I love the stock.</p>
<p>I like my apes.</p>
<p>Don’t get me started on MODS.</p>
<p>This is my way!</p>
