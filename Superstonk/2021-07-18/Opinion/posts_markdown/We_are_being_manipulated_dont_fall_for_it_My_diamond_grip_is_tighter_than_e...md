# Title: We are being manipulated, don't fall for it. My diamond grip is tighter than ever. I'm not selling shit until I see the SHFs fall. This FUD campaign is proof we are on the right track. Expect fuckery and hold with your life. They are desperate for your shares.

We are being manipulated. It is clear as day. They have Psy ops teams working on us and how to break our morale. They want to make us think they are succeeding. Don't give them the pleasure. 

The only thing I'm quite sure at the moment is that Madie  is an agent and they have successfully manipulated the mod team into thinking she is not. She or the team of people behind her must be really skillful and convincing. From the outside it is clear that nothing adds up and she is a plant. Don't blame the mods, they are probably getting mindfucked by a skillful team of psychologists. That + Human mistakes have made the situation to spiral out of control.

Aside of that nothing changes. Join to all the subs. You don't need to choose. If you have a good meme you can even post in all them at the same time. They want to make us think that we have to divide and choose or something. It's bullshit. 

The DD is as solid as ever and the SHFs are digging themselves deeper and deeper everyday trying to control the financial shitshow that they have created. Their only way out is with this drama crap we are all seeing and demoralizing us. They want that we lose trust and faith in each other.

As for me, I like the stock and they are not getting my shares by any means. They are clearly salivating for them and that makes my grip tighter than ever. 

Be excellent to each other apes. Be kind and hold with your life. Don't fall for the bullshit.
