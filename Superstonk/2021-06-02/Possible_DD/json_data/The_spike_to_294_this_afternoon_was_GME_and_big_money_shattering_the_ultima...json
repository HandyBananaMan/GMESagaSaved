I wrote this before even realizing AMC had a halt at the exact same time of the spike I talk about here, and I've been trying to dive in more to make sense of it, because this is just *too* crazy of a coincidence to be a coincidence. If anyone with more wrinkles wants to help make sense of this \"coincidence,\" I would welcome the help, because I'm about tapped out\n\n\nEdit: Why are you bashing me for NOT mentioning AMC? What is going on here? I gotta go to bed, I'll catch up in the morning\n\nEdit again, at the top so you don't miss it: Can't edit my title, but I want to make it clear that \"big money\" was not mean to imply that this is all actions performed by whales fighting each other. While I think it is possible that there could be some whale involvement, I think it's more likely that with the increased attention meme stocks have been getting this week, experienced investors (whether they be retail or otherwise) are watching very closely and are making plays the \"smart money\" way \n\n\n---original post---\n\n\nI've seen a lot of speculation behind what caused the large spike up to 294 this afternoon, and I wanted to clear some things up with all of you, and provide some more jack for your tiddies\n\nFor the past week, GME's daily price action has \\*actually\\* fallen into \"regular\" technical patterns. I've been sharing my tracking in the GME discord, and I hope to help all of you understand how big today was.\n\nBut first, I'll need to go back a little bit\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I'm sure you all know what this is](https://preview.redd.it/gca6sfg0iy271.png?width=2656&format=png&auto=webp&s=721e799f16a29820507fdd9793000bee60115b3b)\n\nSince January's \"sneeze,\" GME share price has been bouncing off this purple resistance line, unable to break past it.\n\nNote: credit goes to FeatherMountain on Discord (idk your reddit name, sorry) for helping me dial in the right placement for this resistance line\n\nAll of the action this past week has been building up to the attack on this resistance line- Last Thursday at close/Friday at open, we bounced off of it, and were met with massive shorts all day Friday in retaliation.\n\nGME then fell into a distinct upward channel yesterday and today- you can see the bounce off the purple line, the day of shorts (Friday) and the upward channel below - screenshot taken at about 11:20 AM\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The blue line in the middle of the channel was the lower boundary almost all day Tuesday. I am personally convinced that the dips below that blue line today were short attacks](https://preview.redd.it/xotvxx0djy271.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bca36170a5c9c4d010ac0916829c0387b92ec22)\n\nAs you can see, after bouncing off the \"ultimate resistance line,\" a strong upward channel was formed that was on a collision course to hit the resistance again.\n\nWhat happened when the channel met the resistance?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BAM](https://preview.redd.it/xhozcvreky271.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=a41f768b6127925f6cb8949d8123158c2f4faba8)\n\nThere you have it. Not only did it break through, but it broke through \\*with a purpose.\\* Check out that volume spike. Oh, also, check out all that sell volume in response (I'm watching you, Kenny)\n\nBut check out how the rest of the day went\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg9p3xyyky271.png?width=2682&format=png&auto=webp&s=5239269936cd1607fe491fd971facf808ac7f7e9\n\nGME consolidated into a wedge with the purple resistance line now acting as it's support, broke out of that into another little baby wedge, broke out again, and closed $20 ABOVE where the toughest resistance had been.\n\n**BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?**\n\nOK, time for some speculation/opinion.\n\nThe volume seen at that huge push right as the upward channel touched the resistance line tells me that there is a lot of money somewhere watching this, waiting until the opportune moment to pull their trigger. Running the price up quickly last week didn't work, so this time they waited patiently, letting the price rise gradually, until the conditions just right.\n\nEdit:  I did not mean to imply that this is all actions performed by whales fighting each other. While I think it is possible that there could be some whale involvement, I think it's more likely that with the increased attention meme stocks have been getting this week, experienced investors (whether they be retail or otherwise) are watching very closely and are making plays the \"smart money\" way \n\nThe huge sell volume was (do I even need to say it?) shorts that were not happy.\n\nThe fact that GME was able to break through, maintain, and close above the strongest resistance line to date, riding on the back of big money \\*somewhere,\\* has me jacked to the fucking tits- although I would not be surprised if we saw a brief consolidation period after a big move like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Spike was a classic large volume breakout past a historical resistance level. GME maintained and closed well above historical resistance.
