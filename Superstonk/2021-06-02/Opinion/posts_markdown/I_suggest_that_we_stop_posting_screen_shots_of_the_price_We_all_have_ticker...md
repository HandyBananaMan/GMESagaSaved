So, I dunno, warning then ban?   

I mean, it's one thing if the price spells "boobs" or something.  Otherwise it's just a delayed and slow ticker.  

And maybe enough with the 420 and 69 posts.   They were sort of funny the first few hundred times.   I mean, of you want to use them in your explanations, sure, but every time it shows up in the ticker?
