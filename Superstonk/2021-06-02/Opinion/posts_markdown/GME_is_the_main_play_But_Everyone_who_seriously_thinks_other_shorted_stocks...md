# Title: GME is the main play. But Everyone who seriously thinks other shorted stocks like amc, bb, nakd, bbby etc are "distractions" and "pumo and dumps", clearly havent read all the god tier DD in depth.

All the god tier DDs like Citadel has no clothes, everything short, etc all deal with how Citadel and other reckless hedgefunds went around naked shorting a whole lot of companies to the ground.

Sure, theres nothing like GME because its got solid fundamentals with a smart billionaire CEO who keeps delivering, and the infamous DFV, but that doesnt mean other companies like BB, AMC and others are a pump n dump.

It actually PROVES that those DD are correct. It should bring UNITY, NOT DIVISION.

You knoe why AMC is having a bigger run? Simply because more people know about it. And the film industry is bigger with more public figures promiting it.

Not many people KNOW about the transformation GME is going through, or have heard of Ryan Cohen.

Whenever I see people saying AMC is a distraction, it just reads as if they are either a shill, or butthurt themselves that they couldnt also get in the ride, but just patting themselves on the back that GME is the one true play.

This is a GME sub, and I am heavily invested in our company with 100% conviction. However, it doesnt mean that other shorted companies and their squeeze runs are a distraction. We seriously need to move away from this cultish mindset. "My belief is the only correct belief, and all other beliefs are fake"

Only paperhands and fools will ever sell out of one position to join the other.

Edit 1: i tried to respond to as many comments as possible but there are simply too many. Basically, the point of this post wasnt to create another post about a different stock than our main stock, GME, but it was the opposite. I wish people STOPPED posting about other stocks which is not GME.

IF YOU THINK SOMETHING IS A DISTRACTION, DONT GET DISTRACTED!!! GOOD FOR YOU. DONT POST AND MOVE ON

If you see someone actually posting about a different stock here and is getting distracted, THEN we can tell the user to not get distracted and delete the post as its irrelevant to the sub.
