# Hi Apes,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I be completely transparent.  I bought Movie Company's $20 and $40 calls back when the stock was 10 a share for Sept.  I spent about 2 or 3k on those positions.  I'm like 99% all GME and think it's the Crown Jewel of all this.   However, I do own a small stake in one position.  I know I might get downvoted into oblivion but I had to say something.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to think the Movie company is not a squeeze but a coordinated pump/dump on behalf of Citadel.   I hope it's not and those Apes get their squeeze but something just feels wrong about it.  There were no breaker halts and nothing feels like a margin call.  I know technically that it doesn't have to play out like Jan.  A squeeze or margin call can be slow or fast.......but something just feels off here.  Something feels really fucking off.  The media seems to be all over this which is red flag number 1.  The price feels like it's controlled is red flag 2.  The overall market seems to be ignoring it with the VIX under 20, red flag 3.   I can go on and on.

&#x200B;

**We found out that Mudrick who bought 8.5 Million shares of the movie company is owned by Citadel and Kenny G is their manager.  We also know from 13F filings that Citadel went long on Movie company.  Are they pumping Movie Company to keep from a GME margin call?  If so...it's smart.  Close out your short positions on Movie Company and go long on them.  Pump it up and tell everyone it's a squeeze.  Retail FOMOs in and they play both sides.  They make millions pumping up the stock then when it gets ridiculously high, you use those like 10 million or more shares you own, (After placing some puts at the peak of course) and make money on the way down too.   You get to fight GME another day.**

I hope I'm wrong.  The idea just came to me this morning.  I couldn't sleep.   I dunno but just be on the look out for fuckery this morning.  


  
Edit1  (4:24PM:  It's now the end of the day.   AMC made a run for a mind boggling 95.22% or $30.51 per share increase.   (Once again,  I own AMC calls that are now 20X I think at this point so I'm not talking shit on them)    


GME finished 13.34% or $33.22 for the day.    


AH GME :  $287.55  


AH Movie:  $70.83
