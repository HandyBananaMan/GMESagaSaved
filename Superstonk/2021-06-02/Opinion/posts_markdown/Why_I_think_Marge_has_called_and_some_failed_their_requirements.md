Looking around at other old meme stocks like (can't specify because of automod, but you know them)- I think HF know the only way they can survive is to pay a premium and cover other short positions first to get people to dump gme and fomo over to them.

This theory/tactic has been mentioned since Jan multiple times and we are witnessing it in practice. They cannot cover GME. Even if HF lose 80% of their business to other short positions, they will stay in business. GME alone will bankrupt anyone involved.

Buy and hold, look at our 5% gains vs 40% (which movie hit premarket at one point) as confirmation bias that they do not want gme to move higher!!

End game confirmed. See ya on the moon.
