    "selftext": "Look. There is literally no need for anyone to post their \"gains\" with posts like \"I'M UP 50K, 100K, 200K AND IM NOT SELLING!!!!\". It's almost as a way to bypass the \"no gain post\" rule to me.\n\nWe DO NOT need to know how much gains you have in your account. It honestly feels like the FUD a couple of weeks ago where shills were posing as XX,XXX or X,XXX holder to create a divide between the apes.\n\nJUST SIMPLY BUY AND HODL. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: For those that are wondering where are these \"gain posts\" I am talking about? I made this post immediately after seeing a highly upvoted post titled something like \"wife telling me to sell after up 36k\", checking the comments I noticed multiple comments talking about the same thing \"I'm up 100k\", \"up 240k as a college student.\". I knew instantly this wasn't right and here's this post to bring attention to this issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I have never been so happy and honoured to be a fellow ape \ud83e\udd8d, I really mean it. Therefore, I wish for everyone to stay vigilant and help each other by downvoting and reporting any *potential FUD* before it has the chance to spread. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nNot financial advice, just a smooth brained ape here who happens to love the stock.",
