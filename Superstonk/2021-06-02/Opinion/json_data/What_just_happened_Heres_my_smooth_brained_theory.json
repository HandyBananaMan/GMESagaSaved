I think they just went stop loss hunting and tried to trigger a flash crash.\n\nThe volume candle for the run up was 418,000.. the next red candle was 1 million volume. \n\nI think they were trying to trigger trailing stops and hope to trigger more stops.. if that was what they just tried to do holy fucking fail. \n\nAlso I must say I am absolutely positively retarded and I could and probably am completely utterly wrong but that\u2019s just my two cents.
