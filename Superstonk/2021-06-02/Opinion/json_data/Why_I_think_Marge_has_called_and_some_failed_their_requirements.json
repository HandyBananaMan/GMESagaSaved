They cannot cover GME. Even if HF lose 80% of their business to other short positions, they will stay in business. GME alone will bankrupt anyone involved.\n\nBuy and hold, look at our 5% gains vs 40% (which movie hit premarket at one point) as confirmation bias that they do not want gme to move higher!!\n\nEnd game confirmed. See ya on the moon.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
