<p>So we just ran up to 293 and then dropped to 267.. I think they just went stop loss hunting and tried to trigger a flash crash.</p>
<p>The volume candle for the run up was 418,000.. the next red candle was 1 million volume. </p>
<p>I think they were trying to trigger trailing stops and hope to trigger more stops.. if that was what they just tried to do holy fucking fail. </p>
<p>Also I must say I am absolutely positively retarded and I could and probably am completely utterly wrong but that’s just my two cents. If that’s what they were trying to do good job apes on removing stops. I think they got some of the trailing stop loss day trader paper hands but we got them by the ducking balls </p>
<p>Let’s gooo</p>
