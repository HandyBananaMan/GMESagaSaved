<p>Look. There is literally no need for anyone to post their "gains" with posts like "I'M UP 50K, 100K, 200K AND IM NOT SELLING!!!!". It's almost as a way to bypass the "no gain post" rule to me.</p>
<p>We DO NOT need to know how much gains you have in your account. It honestly feels like the FUD a couple of weeks ago where shills were posing as XX,XXX or X,XXX holder to create a divide between the apes.</p>
<p>JUST SIMPLY BUY AND HODL. 💎🙌🦍🚀</p>
<p>Edit: For those that are wondering where are these "gain posts" I am talking about? I made this post immediately after seeing a highly upvoted post titled something like "wife telling me to sell after up 36k", checking the comments I noticed multiple comments talking about the same thing "I'm up 100k", "up 240k as a college student.". I knew instantly this wasn't right and here's this post to bring attention to this issue.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have never been so happy and honoured to be a fellow ape 🦍, I really mean it. Therefore, I wish for everyone to stay vigilant and help each other by downvoting and reporting any <em>potential FUD</em> before it has the chance to spread. 🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>Not financial advice, just a smooth brained ape here who happens to love the stock.</p>
