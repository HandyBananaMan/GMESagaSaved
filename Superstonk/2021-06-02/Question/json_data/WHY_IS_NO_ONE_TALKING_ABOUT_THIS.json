    "selftext": "Every \"meme\" stock is on a rocket right now. Every single one. They are reaching heights not seen since January and all at the same time. ALL AT THE SAME TIME. \n\nThis has NOTHING to do with us. Yes we all HODL and buy the dips but the kind of activity we are talking about here is not caused by retail. This is MASSIVE. MASSIVE. There is not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that retail had anything to do with this price action. \n\nSomeone let off the brake pedal. WHY? \n\nEither someone, like Citadel has been margin called here and their shorts are being shut down due to liquidation OR some of the regulations we have been watching went into effect and it's made a significant change to the market. \n\nWE NEED ANSWERS. WE NEED EVERY SMART APE ON TOP OF THIS. THIS IS NOT THE MOASS.\n\nMoass would not take this basket of stocks with it on it's journey. There is some serious shit that just went down or some serious fuckery is afoot and we are all just dancing. Let's get back to work and figure this out.\n\nUpdate: https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqzo1o/i_got_what_you_quant_6221_trading_analysis_and_a/ This is an excellent DD by u/myplayprofile with some answers. This is how we figure it out.",
