    "selftext": "This Wes Christian AMA is mind boggling and HFs are going unpunished for far too long. So many precedents and no one has learned. So much blatant criminal activity and no jail time. No apes should shed tears over their BS.\n\nIf HFs manage to bankrupt a company: \"Their ill-gotten shares aren't taxed and their shorts disappear. Stock holders are the last entities to get paid /or nothing.\" Faaaaaaack\n\nThis isn't about money anymore. These brokers need to be sued to bankruptcy. If I get a tendie or two or 5 or 10 million, that's just icing on the cake.\n\nYou get a share! You get a share! You get a share!\n\nI HODL for enforcement and action. Tendies are now second. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nEdit 1: Clarification on bankruptcy and who gets paid out.\n\nEdit 2: Is it time for a class action lawsuit? Also, Gamestop (the company) hasn't approached Wes to file any lawsuits, but doesn't mean Gamestop approached someone else \ud83d\ude2e\n\nEdit 3: Twas the link at: https://youtu.be/q8-JO3g5bm4",
