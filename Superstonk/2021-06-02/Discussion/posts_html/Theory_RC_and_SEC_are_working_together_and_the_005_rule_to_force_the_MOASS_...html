<p>I have no evidence of this whatsoever, but the thought just occurred to me: what could force the MOASS? There are a bunch of catalyst possibilities, but what could absolutely force it?</p>
<p>That missing 005 could definitely kick it off, or am I wrong? </p>
<p>So pretending this is correct, what if RC went to visit GG, Gary says "We can't just blow this up without facing serious legal issues. Can you provide proof? If we have enough proof, we'll kick it off."</p>
<p>Maybe this is the plan, and RC and DFV know it. DFV got cleared from his legal team to post on Twitter again because RC has ALL the proof needed to show the manipulation by the hedgefucks.</p>
<p>So now, thinking plausible deniability, GG's legal team gives him the go-ahead to unveil 005 but only after the shares have been publicly announced. </p>
<p>This takes the blame away from EVERYONE from starting the MOASS, and places it wholly on the hedgies. Fuck from all angles, and no mayo in sight for poor Kenny.</p>
<p>I have some other ideas floating around, but this was the big one that clicked. Perhaps it's wishful thinking to a degree, but I feel like the SEC wants this over ASAP as well. There is a vested interest though. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong, but we'll find out next week.</p>
