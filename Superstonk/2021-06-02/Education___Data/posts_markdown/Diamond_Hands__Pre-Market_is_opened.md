" So **Why** are you doing this, did oil turned you into a bot ? "

First of all I started doing it for myself, too excited that there's finally action in Pre-Market.

The mere reason I am posting that is for the apes that can't (or don't know how to) check Pre-Market and / or that have tits way too jacked (Mine are so jacked I'm milking 24/7 ðŸš€).

I am adding an hourly comparison to the previous day price action and volume when it's possible, data is beautiful.

**Please** do not downvote if you dislike this post for whatever reasons, or simply don't need it.

Some people might want to use it, this post is completly unbiased, I donâ€™t care about karma, like, really, fuck this sh\*t, only a MOASS would satisfy me and nothing else. I am only willing to provide data, help some apes and jack some tits.

APES STRONG TOGETHER ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€
