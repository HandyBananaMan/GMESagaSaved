So I was doing my morning walkthrough of new FINRA violations and caught this BEAUTY for [Goldman Sachs & Co LLC](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_361.pdf). Anyone else recognize the significances of that date range? It's the SAME timeframe that USS GME was prepping for liftoff.

Don't trust a F\*CKING THING these ass clowns tell you. The data you see is whatever they WANT you to see.

No one knows what data was unavailable to reconstruct the trade, but here's a simplified [list of requirements](https://www.bobsguide.com/articles/trade-reconstruction-a-growing-pain-point-for-firms/):

The data is coming out, apes. Their f\*ckery continues.
