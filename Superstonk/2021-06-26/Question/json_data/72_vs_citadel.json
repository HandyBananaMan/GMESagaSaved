    "selftext": "We have made citadel and Kenny mayo as our point of focus through all of this. But when you look at the numbers from recent DD, point 72 and Cohen have been the leader board for months attacking this. It has always been dismissed/downvoted/ FUD. They are more exposed than citadel. Why has the focuse been solely on Kenny rather than the evil Cohen and their operations. \n\nEdit: just for context I'm adding an additional section and rephrasing the last sentence of OP.\n\n\nNot saying to forget about citadel by any stretch of the imagination. They are designated MM for GME, so they definitely desterve attention. I'm simply saying there are other disgusting companies with the same philosophy as citadel that destroy companies and lives for profit, and they deserve to get some attention from diamond handed apes as well.(72, SUS, etc)",
