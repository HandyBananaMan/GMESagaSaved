<p>IMO, the whole post is kinda fud, so I won't be linking it or talking about it much. The TLDR version is that apes want to predict when other apes will sell, try to sell a bit before, and that will kill the MOASS, and the writer doesn't leave a conclusion, so most people will think that you better sell really early.</p>
<p>I'm here to debunk that post.</p>
<p>The whole post is just a really fucking long way of describing the prisoner's dilemma, which looks like this</p>
<p>----------------------------------You betray -------------You cooperate</p>
<p>Partner betray--------------3 years in jail----------4 years in jail</p>
<p>Partner Cooperate---------1 year in jail-------------2 years in jail</p>
<p>So betraying looks like it's always the best option, but if you both betray, it would be better to simply cooperate. Since we won't know what the other person does until after the fact, we have to somehow convince them to cooperate, but we can still betray, as there are no penalties.</p>
<p>However, this isn't applicable to the situation, because the best outcome is if we both cooperate. It looks more like this.</p>
<p>------------------------------------You betray----------------You cooperate</p>
<p>Partner betray---------------- a few tendies----------Very few tendies</p>
<p>Partner Cooperate-----------Some tendies----------Infinite tendies</p>
<p>In this game, if the majority cooperates, then we win. Therefore, this IS an incentive to cooperate. So which will people choose? The "safer" bet where you betray and get a few guaranteed tendies, or go big? This is where we want to get into game theory, specifically, how you want to be playing every single game.</p>
<p>When you play a game, you seek out win conditions. If you are likely to win if you change nothing, then you go for the safe play. If you are losing, and are going to lose if nothing changes, then you take riskier plays because that is the only way to win.</p>
<p>For many of us, and society as a whole. We're losing, and we're going to lose if nothing changes. Hedgefunds and banks will fuck our economy, take our money, and leave us in poverty for generations to come. With the MOASS being pretty much the only chance to escape wage slavery and live a good life, modest returns won't cut it. We need life-changing, and possibly world changing money.</p>
<p>Remember, just because a few million might be enough for YOU, is it enough for the millions of others who got fucked by banks, but didn't buy GME? If we want to see change in the world, or even generational wealth, to help out our kids, a few million isn't enough. We need more, we have to be greedy.</p>
<p>This means the ONLY win condition is if everyone cooperates for 30 million. Every other value is simply a loss. This means the graph now becomes like this.</p>
<p>-------------------------------You betray-----------------You cooperate</p>
<p>Partner betray----------Lose-----------------------------Lose</p>
<p>Partner Cooperate-----Lose----------------------------Win</p>
<p>At this point, it should be fairly obvious what you should do if you want to win, and I think we could all use just one W in our lives.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: It is in everyone's best interest to keep holding, so people are going to keep holding. People aren't gonna try to time the peak and sell early and peanut prices, because anything below 30m a share isn't enough to create generational wealth and change the world. It's stupid to take small profits when this is our only shot.</p>
