    "selftext": "# Preface\n\nThis is not financial advice. I'm a Chemical Engineer turned Software Developer turned Life Coach. I know math and I understand the power of data AND assumptions. My objective here is to lay out some assumptions (with the way I understand the market) and see what surfaces.\n\nPlease, by all means, challenge these assumptions, prove them wrong, or find a better way to validate them so we can all move forward with an accurate map.\n\n# The Data\n\n**2,041,898,870 Shares** have changed hands SINCE January 29th, 2021.\n\nI was curious this weekend and wondered what the total volume has been since Jan 29th 2021 (basically every day since the run up in January). A simple Google Sheets formula gave me the answer. \n\n**=googlefinance(\"GME\",\"volume\", DATE(2021,1,29), TODAY())**\n\nThis formula will give you an array of volumes for each day. Do a simple sum and you'll see that it's over TWO BILLION SHARES!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily Volume\\/Closing Price since January Run Up](https://preview.redd.it/p85mj3qa4p771.png?width=3136&format=png&auto=webp&s=020d80d8ccdb4e750df3cdc15f05e1f7de97283f)\n\n# Assumptions\n\nKnowing the number of shares that have changed hands since January, my thought was if I could figure out what % of those shares were diamond-handed apes Buying to HODL them to infinity, we could figure out what quantity of shares to add to the \\~226% SI from the Robinhood Class Action Lawsuit.\n\nHere's the assumptions (or categories of what the volume represents to me):\n\n1. HFT/Short Ladder Attacks count in the volume but don't result in any shares accumulated/held\n2. SHF's/MM's are selling naked shorts \n3. Apes are buying and HODLing shares\n4. A small percentage MUST be accounted for day traders taking advantage of the volatility\n\nThe important realization here is that there are really only 4 possibilities happening with each share being traded so it comes down to making assumptions on the average percentage that each category represents.\n\nAn even more important assumption is that apes have been buying and hodling. I, personally, have had at least 5 people that I know tell me they have purchased more shares since January (most of them did not own any shares prior to January 29th.) So yes, the ownership of apes continually increases as time goes on. Tick tock.\n\n# Results\n\nAt the end of the day, the only category that truly matters is #3, Apes buying/HODLing.\n\nI don't pretend to know what percentage makes up the other 3 categories but if any wrinkle-brains out there have an idea or a way to figure that out, it would be super helpful!\n\nMy assumption from my assumptions is that Buying/HODLing represents no greater than 20% of total volume and very likely is much smaller but even at these small percentages, my tits are still JACKED. Again, I would hope to be wrong and I know that I've seen the screenshots from Fidelity/TDAmeritrade where it's 90% buying vs 10% selling each day and the OBV isn't moving, etc... I'm well aware. \n\nHowever, my gut, and that is largely what these assumptions are made from, says it's got to be smaller than that.\n\nWithout further ado, here's what I discovered:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Buy/Hold %|Total Shares Bought/Held Since Jan 29th|\n|:-|:-|\n|0.5%|10,209,494|\n|1.0%|20,418,989|\n|2.5%|51,047,472|\n|5.0%|102,094,944|\n|7.5%|153,142,415|\n|10%|204,189,887|\n|20%|408,379,774|\n\n What does this mean? \n\nOf the 2 Billion shares that have traded hands SINCE Jan 29th, 2021, if 0.5% of that volume was apes buying/Hodling, that means we are now holding an additional 10.2M shares. If that percentage is 20%, we're talking an additional 408M shares...\n\nTaking into account the \\~226% SI from the Robinhood Class Action Lawsuit, assuming 70M shares outstanding is what that is based off of, then 70M X 226% = 158,200,000 Shares.\n\nAdding the total shares Bought/Held gives us new potential SI%'s:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Buy/Hold %|New SI%|\n|:-|:-|\n|0.5%|240.58%|\n|1.0%|255.17%|\n|2.5%|298.92%|\n|5.0%|371.85%|\n|7.5%|444.77%|\n|10%|517.70%|\n|20%|809.40%|\n\nI gladly welcome challenges to my assumptions or for someone to take this and run with it even further. \n\n#",
