Not financial advice. Pure opinion and speculation.

UPDATE: u/jsmar18 made a great point and asked me what “X” represents in my math. I don’t have an answer. When you multiply the glitch by the price at the glitch you get a large number and I’m not sure what that represents. Take this all with a large grain of salt. 

UPDATE 2: u/dramatic-pancake made a great observation about “X”. Saying that “X” could possibly be the amount of money total towards the stock. Currently that number shows $4.3B in the equation but I’m not sure how to verify this. Furthermore, subtracting the funds raised by the company and subtracting that number might be accurate.

Let’s not get our tits jacked here. This was just an experiment looking at something. Frankly I’m shocked it got so much attention. I’m fine with being completely wrong and hopefully it sparks others to think critically about the glitch and keep an eye on it. I’m retarded.

A few thoughts: I don’t believe hedge funds have covered and close their short positions. I believe the price is manipulated and not reflective of reality. I am not sure what the glitches are. I am open to admitting I’m wrong. I appreciate the upvotes not for karma but for visibility and hopefully some smarter apes can help. Thanks for reading and being kind apes.

Down to business....

Edit: The real price CURRENTLY unmanipulated at $209 is actually $5,535.10 (personal opinion). My floor still needs to look like a phone number.

TLDR: glitch formula back in March showed $182.02 was a price point in which ~$1,700 a share was the target. New glitch showed up yesterday. With the same equation below the price shows $5,535.10. If $209 becomes a new battle as was $180-$182, I believe this glitch might be showing us what the actual price is without manipulation. Who knows 🤷🏽

Glitch date: Friday June 25, 21
2,073,913,491 (glitch) * $209.51 = 434,505,615,499.41 / 78,500,000 (total shares) = $5,535.10

glitch number * price at glitch = X / total share in float = $5,535.10

PAST GLITCHES AND FORMULAS

Glitch #1 Revised (73.5M shares)
94,189,110 (glitch) * $46.12 (price) = 4,344,001,753.20
4,344,001,753.20 / 73,500,000 (total shares) = 59.10
59.10 + 46.12 = $105.22

Glitch #2 Revised (73.5M shares)
634,322,033 (glitch) * $182.02 (price) = 115,459,296,466.66
115,459,296,466.66 / 73,500,000 (total shares) = 1,570.87
1,570.87 + 182.02 = $1,752.89

Glitch #3 Revised (73.5M shares)
290,114,478 (glitch) * $183.77(price) = 53,314,337,622.06
53,314,337,622.06 / 73,500,000 (total shares) = 725.36
725.36 + $183.75 = $909.11

Glitch #4 Revised (73.5M shares)
1,853,259,956 (glitch) * $183.75(price) = 340,536,516,915
340,536,516,915 / 73,500,000(total shares) = 4633.14
4633.14 + $183.75 = $4816.89

Not financial advice. I am pleased with my investment. And I’m an idiot.

Edit: I’d like to make a prediction that $209 price point is danger zone. Price may get pushed back down and battle to stay above $209. Just like what happened with the $182.02 price point weeks ago.
