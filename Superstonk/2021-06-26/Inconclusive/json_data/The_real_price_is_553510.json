When you multiply the glitch by the price at the glitch you get a large number and I\u2019m not sure what that represents. Take this all with a large grain of salt. \n\nUPDATE 2: u/dramatic-pancake made a great observation about \u201cX\u201d. Saying that \u201cX\u201d could possibly be the amount of money total towards the stock. Currently that number shows $4.3B in the equation but I\u2019m not sure how to verify this. Furthermore, subtracting the funds raised by the company and subtracting that number might be accurate.\n\nLet\u2019s not get our tits jacked here. This was just an experiment looking at something. Frankly I\u2019m shocked it got so much attention. I\u2019m fine with being completely wrong and hopefully it sparks others to think critically about the glitch and keep an eye on it. I\u2019m retarded.\n\nA few thoughts: I don\u2019t believe hedge funds have covered and close their short positions. I believe the price is manipulated and not reflective of reality. I am not sure what the glitches are. I am open to admitting I\u2019m wrong. I appreciate the upvotes not for karma but for visibility and hopefully some smarter apes can help. Thanks for reading and being kind apes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDown to business....\n\nEdit: The real price CURRENTLY unmanipulated at $209 is actually $5,535.10 (personal opinion). My floor still needs to look like a phone number.\n\nTLDR: glitch formula back in March showed $182.02 was a price point in which ~$1,700 a share was the target. New glitch showed up yesterday. With the same equation below the price shows $5,535.10. If $209 becomes a new battle as was $180-$182, I believe this glitch might be showing us what the actual price is without manipulation.
