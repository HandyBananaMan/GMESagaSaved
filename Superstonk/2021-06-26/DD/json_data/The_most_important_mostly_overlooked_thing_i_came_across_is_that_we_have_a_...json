    "selftext": " #EDIT/MODS!\nTo prevent this from getting taken down and answer to concerns about the geographical data not showing retail investors, I want to give an overview on how European investors of US companies are represented .   \n \n\nhttp://www.europeanissuers.eu/positions/files/view/591da562f05ba-en\n\n \nPlease read this, it is my understanding, that there isn\u2019t a single European retail investor, that is **NOT** counted as institutional, since we get bundled up and put in pools:\n\n\u201cIntermediaries tend to use \u201comnibus\u201d or \u201cpooled nominee\u201d accounts at CSD or (other) intermediary level in which they book the securities of more than one investor.\u201d \n  \nTherefore i wont take down my post, as it remains valid, ***even if bloomberg only showed the institutional % of ownership geographically***\n\n \n\n \n \n \n# Intro\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nHey there, fellow holders of **multiple** gamestops.\n\nFirst things first, the used data stems from stonecold official sources.\n\nMost importantly **AFM - The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets,**  which is the financial services regulatory authority for the Netherlands, they supervise conduct in the entire financial market sector: savings, investing, insurance and lending in the beautiful Netherlands.\n\nIn simpler terms: The AFM describe themselves as \"committed to promoting fair and transparent financial markets\", what sounds exactly like what **SEC - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission**, *should be doing* aswell. \n\nTherefore the AFM is basically the dutch counterpart to the SEC. \n\nMy second source is data from **Bloomberg's Terminal**, which shouldn't need much introduction, and more specifically its top geographic ownership listing, that shows how many of Gamestop's shares are held by investors in individual countries *in relation to the total amount of available shares* (internationally). \n\nFor Example, the *Americans (31) hold mostly all of the available shares*, a **whopping 84%**.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bloomberg: Ownership amount by Country expressed in Percent \\(&amp;amp;amp;amp;#37;\\). Data from 28 May 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/3ftwdczkeo771.png?width=939&amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;s=4e2371410e448d33dba601f85cb338650cac7b91)\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n# How many Shares are held?\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, i get it, percentage doesn't count for much, if the public oppinion is, that there can't be more shares than Gamestop ever issued. Lets get to it then. \n\nOur beloved dutch holders (36) *only* *amount to* *0.32% of presently held GME shares.* High time to look at what our friendly conduct supervisor, the AFM, has reported in this document: \n\n[Download AFM Market Watch 3 (PDF)](https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch/afm-market-watch-3-eng.pdf?la=en) \n\n(Alternatively you can maneuvre there by following [this](https://www.afm.nl/en/professionals/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch), its almost at the top of the page under 'Edition 3 - Investing and social media in light of GameStop' and can be downloaded on the right hand side.\n\nHere comes my math\\* i'm gonna round up numbers slightly:\n\nSome 30000 dutch investors bought GME, their averaged buying amounted to around $10000 each, which then amounts to $330000000 if multiplied and shows money spend on GME shares by holders in the Netherlands.\n\nTheir average buying price was $190, which means if we devide those juicy $330000000 by price per share of $190 we get a number for shares owned by those 30000 people and it's....\n\n**...1750000 shares!**\n\n# \n\n# How many Shares are held INTERNATIONALLY though?\n\nNetherlands holds a **laughable 0.32%** **of GME shares**\n\nNetherlands holds a **big pile of 1750000 shares**\n\nIf 0.32% amount to 1750000 share - **100% amounts to: 550000000**\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n# Outro\n\nYes **550 MILLION, thats over 7 times shares outstanding, this shit is insane.**\n\nAmericans alone own around 400 million more shares than ever were issued by the company.",
