<p>#EDIT/MODS!
To prevent this from getting taken down and answer to concerns about the geographical data not showing retail investors, I want to give an overview on how European investors of US companies are represented .   </p>
<p>http://www.europeanissuers.eu/positions/files/view/591da562f05ba-en</p>
<p>Please read this, it is my understanding, that there isn’t a single European retail investor, that is <strong>NOT</strong> counted as institutional, since we get bundled up and put in pools:</p>
<p>“Intermediaries tend to use “omnibus” or “pooled nominee” accounts at CSD or (other) intermediary level in which they book the securities of more than one investor.” </p>
<p>Therefore i wont take down my post, as it remains valid, <strong><em>even if bloomberg only showed the institutional % of ownership geographically</em></strong></p>
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;</p>
<p>Hey there, fellow holders of <strong>multiple</strong> gamestops.</p>
<p>First things first, the used data stems from stonecold official sources.</p>
<p>Most importantly <strong>AFM - The Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets,</strong>  which is the financial services regulatory authority for the Netherlands, they supervise conduct in the entire financial market sector: savings, investing, insurance and lending in the beautiful Netherlands.</p>
<p>In simpler terms: The AFM describe themselves as "committed to promoting fair and transparent financial markets", what sounds exactly like what <strong>SEC - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, <em>should be doing</em> aswell. </p>
<p>Therefore the AFM is basically the dutch counterpart to the SEC. </p>
<p>My second source is data from <strong>Bloomberg's Terminal</strong>, which shouldn't need much introduction, and more specifically its top geographic ownership listing, that shows how many of Gamestop's shares are held by investors in individual countries <em>in relation to the total amount of available shares</em> (internationally). </p>
<p>For Example, the <em>Americans (31) hold mostly all of the available shares</em>, a <strong>whopping 84%</strong>.</p>
<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;</p>
<h1>How many Shares are held?</h1>
<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;</p>
<p>Okay, i get it, percentage doesn't count for much, if the public oppinion is, that there can't be more shares than Gamestop ever issued. Lets get to it then. </p>
<p>Our beloved dutch holders (36) <em>only</em> <em>amount to</em> <em>0.32% of presently held GME shares.</em> High time to look at what our friendly conduct supervisor, the AFM, has reported in this document: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.afm.nl/~/profmedia/files/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch/afm-market-watch-3-eng.pdf?la=en">Download AFM Market Watch 3 (PDF)</a> </p>
<p>(Alternatively you can maneuvre there by following <a href="https://www.afm.nl/en/professionals/onderwerpen/afm-market-watch">this</a>, its almost at the top of the page under 'Edition 3 - Investing and social media in light of GameStop' and can be downloaded on the right hand side.</p>
<p>Here comes my math* i'm gonna round up numbers slightly:</p>
<p>Some 30000 dutch investors bought GME, their averaged buying amounted to around $10000 each, which then amounts to $330000000 if multiplied and shows money spend on GME shares by holders in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Their average buying price was $190, which means if we devide those juicy $330000000 by price per share of $190 we get a number for shares owned by those 30000 people and it's....</p>
<p><strong>...1750000 shares!</strong></p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>How many Shares are held INTERNATIONALLY though?</h1>
<p>Netherlands holds a <strong>laughable 0.32%</strong> <strong>of GME shares</strong></p>
<p>Netherlands holds a <strong>big pile of 1750000 shares</strong></p>
<p>If 0.32% amount to 1750000 share - <strong>100% amounts to: 550000000</strong></p>
<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;</p>
<h1>Outro</h1>
<p>Yes <strong>550 MILLION, thats over 7 times shares outstanding, this shit is insane.</strong></p>
<p>Americans alone own around 400 million more shares than ever were issued by the company.</p>
