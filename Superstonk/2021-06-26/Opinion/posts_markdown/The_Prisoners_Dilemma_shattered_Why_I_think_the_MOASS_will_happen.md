January holder here. One of my biggest concerns in the early days of this whole saga was centered around the Prisoner's Dilemma. If you aren't familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma, imagine two people involved in a crime separated in different cells. They both know if they keep their mouths shut they will both go free. The wrinkle is the DA has offered a deal - the first person to rat out the other goes free. This changes the whole dynamic. The only way to *guarantee* you go free is to snitch on your partner. The outcome which will help everyone get what they want is now the riskier path to take. A version of this was depicted in *The Dark Knight* with the two ferries armed with bombs and each detonator was given to the other boat.

The first time I learned about GME, I understood it. This is not my first rodeo in the stock market and you didn't have to explain what a short squeeze was to me, I just needed to see the numbers. The numbers on GME showed what was possible - a short squeeze like the world had never seen before. However, because of the unique distributed nature of this short squeeze by retail investors an enormous Prisoner's Dilemma formed and I was unsure how this would play out. GME is a very unique situation and I don't know of any historical examples like it.

Holding GME stock was like being a prisoner with **1,000,000 other prisoners** anxious to get out and make a quick buck. If a third of them decided to sell, the whole thing could fall apart and we'd all leave empty handed, or worse, broke.

But you know what? I'm still here. And you're still here. Despite two days that had insane price drops and immense pressure on apes to sell (especially those who got in at high prices), we're still holding strong. In fact, many of us doubled down and bought more. It actually gives me hope in humanity that millions can trust others enough to put their own hard earned cash at risk. It's kind of...inspiring.

My sister bought GME at $320 in January. She hasn't sold a single share. Do you know why she hasn't sold? It's because she trusts you. I no longer think about the GME Prisoner's Dilemma because I trust you too. We've been thrown under a giant mountain of weight and told to sell our shares and protect our money.

But the mountain didn't crush us.

It just turned us into diamonds.
