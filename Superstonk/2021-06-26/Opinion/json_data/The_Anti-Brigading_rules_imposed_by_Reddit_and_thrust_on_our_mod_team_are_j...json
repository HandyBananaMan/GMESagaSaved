    "selftext": "When I was a soldier, I was also a linguist /interrogator. I was attached to many groups, and always listening to radio communications as we approached our objective. I remember the distinctive tingling I would get in my fingers and toes when their communications started getting fucked with, as it meant it was almost time for action. \n\nThis is not a new tactic, but was employed by biblical armies and written about by sun tzu. Disrupting communication is the precursor to any battle. Whether you are destroying bridges and killing messengers, jamming radio, or prohibiting free discussion and sharing of information.\n\nApes, my fingers and toes are once again tingling, and my tits are jacking like a Venice Beach hooker. Shills have successfully spread disinformation and used divisive language to disrupt free exchange of ideas and info using Reddit admin itself. That means the shit is about to hit the fan!!\n\nWe apes are excellent at looking for prognosticating symbols, and this is no exception. The less they want us to communicate, the closer we are to the squozening!\n\nEdit: seriously with the reporting of this post?",
