<p>Remember what Mark Cuban said apes.  Our best move is to support Gamestop and show that we are long on the company.  </p>
<p>If we want Gamestop to compete with the tech giants like Amazon, then we need to make Gamestop a bigger part of our lives than Netflix, Amazon, Walmart you get the idea.  </p>
<p>If Gamestop suddenly gets 500k+ new accounts, subscribers, customers (even though a lot of us already are I'm sure) then it's only gonna push the stonk price up and then we ARE the catalyst dang it!   游비GME游비 游비GME游비 游비GME游비 游비GME游비</p>
