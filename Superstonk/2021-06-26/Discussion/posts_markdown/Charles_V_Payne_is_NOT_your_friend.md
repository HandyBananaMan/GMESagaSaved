I've been seeing this shit go rampant the past few days, and I feel like I gotta say something.

Charles V Payne is not your friend.

[Here he is Retweeting a shilly ass article attempting to paint retail as highly coordinated risk on the market.](https://preview.redd.it/5mop84ymbn771.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=415bd325af02f68c0ff1ccffb4ffe8960e1ca5fa)

Like what the f\*\*\* is everyone doing?

No one on Mainstream Media is your friend. If they were, they'd be fired.

So ask yourself why he hasn't been?

Here's a few snippets of the article.

Kinda seems like everyone's forgetting they're running a multi-million dollar campaign to make HF's look good.[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-launch-effort-boost-090000756.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-launch-effort-boost-090000756.html)

I called him out on the tweet and he hasn't responded yet.

Don't be afraid to call these ~~fuckers~~ Shills out. They're not your friends.

STAY ALERT. Fucks sake..

Edit: Sorry I forgot to link the article.

 I'm not trying to cause a firefight here.   
I apologize for misleading.  
I am simply saying keep your eyes open. Don't let a simple act of kindness sway your view.
