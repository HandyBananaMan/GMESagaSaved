Charles Payne is not our friend.

As awesome as it was to hear paper hand portnoy be called a little bitch on national tv, it didn’t feel natural.

It felt like theater

You know who would love to hear Portnoy be called a lil bitch? Apes

I know the real apes out there don’t buy the bullshit but to the young apes Charles Payne is not and will never be our friend.

That theater that we witnessed was just a chess move to move closer to apes hearts so we can be manipulated on another date.

So even if it seemed awesome can we stop giving C-Payne love?
