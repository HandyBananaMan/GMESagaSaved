Dungeons and Dragons is one of the OG games, a marvelous way to explore our own creativity and personalities, it made a big difference in my household over multiple generations.

I would love to see my favorite store on the Citadel (GameStop) stocked to the tits with the full range of D&D books for players and DMs, high quality dice, and minis (WE DROP MORTGAGES ON THESE)

ARE YOU YOU GUYS PICKING UP WHAT IM PUTTING DOWN?

I LIKE TO SLAY DRAGONS WITH MY **DIAMOND** HANDS AND SLAM ELF PUSS.
