I am an Europoor from Belgium and I could use some new gear hell even a new PC setup, some boardgames and all the other great items they have on gamestop.com but sadly they aren't shipping worldwide yet. Since there are shareholders literally worldwide and alot of people wants to support them I think it should be the next step to become this tech giant.

I'm pretty sure they are working on this but I would like to see if there are more people desperately waiting for this 🚀
