<p>Comment got too long (that 1500 word limit) so I'm gonna make a post to discuss the SAC capital/point72/plotkin/Citadel partnership. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SAC Capital Advisors was founded in 1992 and <strong><em>converted its investment operations to the Point72 Asset Management family office in 2014.</em></strong> In 2018, the firm reopened to external investors after a two-year ban and began accepting outside capital</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-sac-plotkin-idUSBREA2J2B920140321">(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen will lose one of his top portfolio managers when Gabriel Plotkin sets up his own hedge fund, a person familiar with his plans said on Thursday.</a></p>
<p>Plotkin, who managed roughly $1 billion in positions at Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors, is expected to leave before the end of the year and Cohen is likely to invest some of his money in the new venture, said the person who is not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters at the private firm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After news of the investment from Citadel and Point72 came out, speculation abounded on social media platforms about Griffin's possible role in the unfolding drama. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/citadel-billionaire-ken-griffin-defends-melvin-stake-against-what-he-calls-an-insane-conspiracy-theory.html">In a now-deleted tweet, Twitch co-founder Justin Kan said he "got a tip" that Griffin may have been involved in Robinhood's move to throttle access to GameStop bulls.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Melvin was famously short GameStop and lost more than 50 percent during January following a short squeeze orchestrated by a Reddit forum called WallStreetBets, whose members included retail investors in GameStop. <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r2h6zshrklf7/Melvin-Capital-Is-Facing-Nine-Lawsuits-Related-to-the-GameStop-Frenzy">As the stock soared, various online brokerages catering to those investors, including Robinhood, restricted buying shares of GameStop, among other stocks heavily shorted by Melvin.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital has been short GameStop since the fund’s inception six years ago, the hedge fund manager told members of the House Committee on Financial Services during a hearing Thursday on the turmoil surrounding trading in the stock last month.</p>
<p><strong><em>GameStop’s stock was trading at around $40 a share when Melvin first shorted it in 2014, Plotkin told the committee. When asked what he thought GameStop was worth at the time, Plotkin said, “I don’t recall.”</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qm7508qzvkhd/Melvin-Capital-Added-to-GameStop-Shorts-as-WallStreetBets-Took-Aim">Last year, when the shares fell as low as $2.57, however, Plotkin held onto his GameStop short.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After graduating from Northwestern University with a degree in Economics in 2001, Gabriel Plotkin joined Ken Griffin's hedge fund Citadel LLC, and later Connecticut-based hedge fund North Sound Capital.[5] Prior to starting Melvin Capital, Plotkin was a trader at Steve Cohen's SAC Capital, where he managed a portfolio of mostly consumer stocks valued at about $1.3 billion.[1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mohammed Grimeh is rapidly expanding his macro team at Point72 Asset Management, tripling the number of portfolio managers to more than 30, with plans to bring on more.</p>
<p>Grimeh, who has been on a hiring spree since joining the firm in February 2020, has snapped up nine new portfolio managers so far this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/point72-macro-head-poaches-from-citadel-goldman-in-hiring-spree">Three of them hail from rivals Citadel and ExodusPoint Capital Management and two come from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then right after giving Plotkin a ton of money, Steve had to raise more immediately. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d57150cf-1f96-41a5-9bd0-3285e7f0073f">Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management has raised $1.5bn from investors, boosting the hedge fund’s assets under management after it lost 10 per cent in January and provided emergency financing to Melvin Capital, the firm at the centre of the GameStop short squeeze.</a></p>
<p>Melvin, run by Mr Cohen’s protégé Gabe Plotkin, received $750m from Point72 and $2bn from rival Citadel last week after suffering steep losses on its short positions. Retail traders co-ordinating on Reddit drove up shares in GameStop and other companies Melvin was betting against.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melvin has $2 billion of Citadel's money and $1.75 billion of point72's. Point 72 had a billion in Melvin before the bailout. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-point72-idUSKBN29X0C7">One of the rescuers was Cohen's hedge fund, which has roughly $1 billion under management with Melvin, NYT said.</a></p>
<p>Point72 decided to add $750 million, Melvin said on Monday, besides accepting an investment of $2 billion from Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund led by Ken Griffin.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Kr00ney/status/1291873556683534342">This happened</a> during the pandemic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Point72 has reached out to other trading platforms and investing apps in a hunt for new trading signals, according to people with direct knowledge of the outreach.</p>
<p>The requests came just hours after popular trading app Robinhood restricted access to an API that showed what stocks were most popular among its users. <a href="https://headtopics.com/us/point72-contacts-other-investing-apps-after-robinhood-data-taken-down-business-insider-14927250">The owner of one website that used the data, robintrack.net, told Bloomberg in June that he'd seen evidence that Point72 and quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw were trying to scrape his data.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robinhood customers used these “scoreboards” to generate trading ideas, as did certain hedge funds. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelcannivet/2020/10/17/for-robinhood-the-smartest-choice-is-to-keep-user-data-private/">One of those hedge funds was reportedly Point72, run by Wall Street legend, Steve Cohen.</a></p>
<p>When the Robinhood data feed went dark, Business Insider reported Point72 immediately started calling around to other trading platforms and investing apps, searching for similar data the firm could use to generate “new trading signals”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A line from 2016 that I thought was interesting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Billionaire investor Steven Cohen said that too many hedge funds placing the same types of bets contributed to sharp losses for his $11 billion Point72 Asset Management earlier this year.</p>
<p>“One of my biggest worries is that there are so many players out there trying to do similar strategies,” Cohen said Monday, speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.</p>
<p><a href="https://fortune.com/2016/05/03/steven-cohen-blames-other-hedge-funds-for-losses/">“If one of these highly levered players had a rough run and took down risk, would we be collateral damage?” Cohen said. “In February we drew down 8 percent which for us is a lot. My worst fears were realized.”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Point72 <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001603466/000089534521000552/ff318036_406ba.htm">filed an amendment</a> a week ago that I believe states they took their investors money ($1.75B) and invested it in Melvin and basically just said no take backs if it fails. <em>They hustled their customers.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>(page 9):</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is possible that an investment program may be structured in which a Fund will <strong><em>co-invest in a portfolio company</em></strong> (or a pooled investment vehicle) with a Point72 Entity or with an investment fund or separate account, <strong><em>organized primarily for the benefit of investors that are not affiliated with Point72 (“Third Party Investors”)^4 and over which a Point72 Entity exercises investment discretion</em></strong> or which is managed by a Point72 Entity (a “Point72 Third Party Fund”).  Co-investments with a Point72 Entity or with a Point72 Third Party Fund in a <strong><em>transaction in which Point72’s investment was made pursuant to a contractual obligation to a Point72 Third Party Fund</em></strong> will not be subject to Condition 3 in Section IV below (the “1940 Act Co-Investment Restrictions”).  All other side-by-side investments held by Point72 Entities will be subject to the 1940 Act Co-Investment Restrictions."   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They say they signed a contract outside of the purvey of the 1940 act, and in some way exercise investment discretion. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>^4 "These Third Party Investors may include, for example, U.S. and non-U.S. institutional investors such as public and private pension funds, foundations, endowments, and corporations, and high net worth individuals resident in and outside of the United States."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>^ the money is in one of those, <em>that they had contractual obligations to.</em> That allows them to ignore the 1940 act?</p>
<p>There's also this in it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Applicants request an exemption from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia-1815.htm">Section 17(j) and Rule 17j-1</a> (except the anti-fraud provisions of Rule 17j-l (b)) because the requirements contained therein are burdensome and unnecessary as applied to the Funds.  Requiring each Fund to adopt a written code of ethics and requiring access persons to report each of their securities transactions (including the attendant record review and retention procedures) would be time consuming and expensive, and would serve little purpose in light of, among other things, the community of interest among the investors in such Fund by virtue of their common association in Point72; the substantial and largely overlapping protections afforded by the conditions with which such Fund has agreed to comply; <strong><em>the concern of Point72 that personnel who participate in such Fund actually receive the benefits they expect to receive when investing in such Fund; the fact that the investments of such Fund will be investments that usually would not be offered to the investors in such Fund,</em></strong> including those investors who would be deemed access persons, as individual investors; and the existing written compliance policies and procedures that have been adopted by Point72 under the Advisers Act which, among other things, include a code of ethics and securities pre-clearance procedure, each of which will generally be applicable to members of Point72 and Eligible Employees. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they basically are saying they don't want to report shit because it takes time and is burdensome and let us crime in peace.</p>
<p>The other point being, if this wasn't in there in January and Melvin went under. Point72 investors were on the hook for $1billion invested. And we know what that can turn into with Archegos/Credit suisse. <strong><em>there was no clause in January to cover the investment in Melvin with customer funds or adding the $750m of investor funds.</em></strong> they put it in now due to reporting requirements changing.</p>
