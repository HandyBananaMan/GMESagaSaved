<p>Charles Payne is not our friend.</p>
<p>As awesome as it was to hear paper hand portnoy be called a little bitch on national tv, it didn’t feel natural.</p>
<p>It felt like theater</p>
<p>You know who would love to hear Portnoy be called a lil bitch? Apes</p>
<p>I know the real apes out there don’t buy the bullshit but to the young apes Charles Payne is not and will never be our friend.</p>
<p>That theater that we witnessed was just a chess move to move closer to apes hearts so we can be manipulated on another date.</p>
<p>So even if it seemed awesome can we stop giving C-Payne love?</p>
