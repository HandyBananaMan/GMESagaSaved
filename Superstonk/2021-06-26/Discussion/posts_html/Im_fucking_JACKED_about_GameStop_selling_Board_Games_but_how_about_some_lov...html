<p>Dungeons and Dragons is one of the OG games, a marvelous way to explore our own creativity and personalities, it made a big difference in my household over multiple generations.</p>
<p>I would love to see my favorite store on the Citadel (GameStop) stocked to the tits with the full range of D&amp;D books for players and DMs, high quality dice, and minis (WE DROP MORTGAGES ON THESE)</p>
<p>ARE YOU YOU GUYS PICKING UP WHAT IM PUTTING DOWN?</p>
<p>I LIKE TO SLAY DRAGONS WITH MY <strong>DIAMOND</strong> HANDS AND SLAM ELF PUSS.</p>
