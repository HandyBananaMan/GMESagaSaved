<p>I keep an eye on XLF and most of the stocks that are in it. I like to keep a broad view of the market so I can see what's coming from different angles.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/n91plaw4bo771.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1debae886a14eec520a3371a1f0d6efc5b2b61c">What's in the XLF + weight. Website at bottom.</a></p>
<p>With that, the new rules that went into place yesterday show me that some major $hit is about to go down.</p>
<p>Which new rules?</p>
<p>DTC-2021-011</p>
<p>NSCC-2021-007</p>
<p>FICC-2021-004</p>
<p>One thing to note before I continue. A quick description of what these bodies do:</p>
<p>DTCC- settles the vast majority of securities transactions in the U.S.</p>
<p>NSCC - certain transactions for virtually all broker-to-broker trades involving  equities, corporate and municipal debt, American depositary receipts,  exchange-traded funds, and unit investment trusts.</p>
<p>FICC - ensures the systematic and efficient settlement and clearing of U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed security (MBS) transactions in the market. providing clearing and settlement services to the financial markets</p>
<p>All three of these rule edits/additions are basically saying the same thing.</p>
<p>FICC-2021-004:</p>
<p>" 1. Text of the Proposed Rule Change (a)The proposed rule change of Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) is annexed hereto as Exhibit 5 and consists of modifications to FICC’s Government Securities Division (“GSD”) Rulebook (the “GSD Rules”), Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (“MBSD”) Clearing Rules (the “MBSD Clearing Rules”) and MBSD EPN Rules (the “EPN Rules,” and collectively with the GSD Rules and the MBSD Clearing Rules, the “Rules”)1 to (i) revise certain provisions in the Rules relating to the confidentiality of information furnished by applicants, Members and EPN Users (collectively, “participants”) to FICC, (ii) require that each participant maintain confidential information furnished by FICC or its affiliates in confidence and restrict use and disclosure of such information, (iii) add certain officers who are allowed to determine that there is a Market Disruption Event pursuant to GSD Rule 50 and MBSD Rule 40 and (iv) add a new GSD Rule 50A and MBSD Rule 40A to address situations in which it is necessary to disconnect a Member, EPN User, third party service provider, or service bureau due to an imminent threat of harm to FICC, Members, EPN Users and/or other market participants.  Each of the proposed changes is described in greater detail below. "</p>
<p>NSCC-2021-007:</p>
<p>" 1. Text of the Proposed Rule Change (a)The proposed rule change of National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) is annexed hereto as Exhibit 5 and consists of modifications to NSCC’s Rules &amp; Procedures (“Rules”)1 to (i) revise certain provisions in the Rules relating to the confidentiality of information furnished by applicants, Members and Limited Members (collectively, “participants”) to NSCC, (ii) require that each participant maintain confidential information furnished by NSCC or its affiliates in confidence and restrict use and disclosure of such information, (iii) add certain officers who are allowed to determine that there is a Market Disruption Event pursuant to Rule 60 and (iv) add a new Rule 60A to address situations in which it is necessary to disconnect a Member, Limited Member, third party service provider, or service bureau due to an imminent threat of harm to NSCC, Members, Limited Members and/or other market participants.  Each of the proposed changes is described in greater detail below."</p>
<p>DTC-2021-011:</p>
<p>" 1. Text of the Proposed Rule Change (a)The proposed rule change of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) is annexed hereto as Exhibit 5 and consists of modifications to DTC’s Rules, Bylaws and Organization Certificate (the “Rules”)1 to (i) revise certain provisions in the Rules relating to the confidentiality of information furnished by Participants2 to DTC, (ii) require that each Participant maintain confidential information furnished by DTC or its affiliates in confidence, and restrict use and disclosure of such information, (iii) add certain officers who are allowed to determine that there is a Market Disruption Event pursuant to Rule 38 and (iv) add a new Rule 38(A) to address situations in which it is necessary to disconnect a Participant, or third party service provider, or service bureau due to an imminent threat of harm to DTC, Participants and/or other market participants.  Each of the proposed changes is described in greater detail below."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These are all dated 6/25/2021. Why would you implement 3 rules on the same day with the same edits? What would be the rush for the NSCC, DTCC and FICC to have the same rule change made?</p>
<p>Especially when they were also approved on the same day. September 15, 2020.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think someone got a taste of the new Marge AI. They had their hour to fulfill their requirements and failed. MARAI then took over and did the work they didn't want to.</p>
<p>Why do I think that?</p>
<p>Well, the shorts on the RUT (Russell 2000 ETF) don't have the same affects as they used to. Now that GME is in the IWF (Russell 1000 ETF), just being in the neighbourhood of bigger cap companies makes shorting the IWF not only expensive but basically pointless.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/l81axezybo771.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ae33a63125ffb7b858d6c03d95a6f4a33e60ce2">Nothing like a $4 spike!</a></p>
<p>What caused the spike?</p>
<p>EOD trades don't usually get settled on the spot. 4:30pm - 5:00pm can sometimes show pretty big spikes in GME if the volume was heavy near the end of the trading day. This, as we know, is due to the availability of shares.</p>
<p>After a few days of selling pressure as our new friendly whales prepared to add GME to their rebalanced ETF's and portfolios, GME suddenly had some major volume show up. I can't speak for everyone but I was pretty excited to see it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/3m4ft6tqeo771.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d4b608d0f8cc8b119f663ad025e273b8f502ad3">A $10 rise on a Friday! YEAH BABY!!!</a></p>
<p>How about what happened at 4:01.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/zotlhb9yeo771.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deb70d445b15c139db4522afaa134c07c122baf4">$840,000,000 worth of GME @ $210. Somebody likes the stock!</a></p>
<p>Who do I think got the call?</p>
<p>This is where I'm asking for help. I noticed some funny business with Wells Fargo but it might be worth looking at Point72 as well. We already know about Mayo man and his carelessness.</p>
<p>I think Mayo still has some fight left in him. I don't think he would be the first one that gets the call. Add that to some digital currency holdings and he can survive, for now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/dhu9dtbjbo771.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de0c8147e588c2268f85a9b3ba57300d5ca4b9c7">It happened after hours of course. $8 is a pretty big candle.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/7xliqd6nbo771.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5935ed72b392f1e49de18433b93bffb0669359d4">That's a lot of volume!</a></p>
<p>I looked at some other banks stocks along with some other XLF associated stocks and didn't see anything out of the ordinary for any of them. WFC was the only one. When one bank stock moves, they typically all move in unison.</p>
<p>At times, when only one moves, they end up in the news the following week.</p>
<p>A quick look at the Dark Pool Data before I sign off:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/f3njgm3vko771.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e7994f838929ccca6d4e65b7beceafe17de3820">This is from Friday June 25</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/hb7murj0lo771.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24d7f622be8b43ad789bb72bd5c39f928188bead">Past two weeks. </a></p>
<p>Somebody wants GME down in a bad way. 60% of the volume from Friday went through dark pools. Public trading showed  8.99M on Google at 4pm. That 4M at 4:01pm is not included.</p>
<p>TLDR: There's no point to a TLDR on this post. Without fully understanding what's up above, you wouldn't know what, or if you could add to what I have.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Adding some WFC dark pool data to show a massive sudden short position.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/m4tj97gzto771.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c7ab1a7f5c5cd2dc6384be856213d5a3b2c0adc">$107,797,230 short position out of nowhere. Puts on Wells Fargo!</a></p>
<p>Edit/ addition 2:</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this slipped my mind but there was also this:</p>
<p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/warren-buffett-sells-31-year-old-investment-in-wells-fargo/articleshow/82727758.cms">Warren Buffett sells 31-year-old investment in Wells Fargo</a></p>
<p>Edit/addition 3:</p>
<p>Not sure why I didn't look earlier. I don't watch QQQ very closely. I wondered why 79% of the QQQ daily volume was shorted through dark pools on Jun 25.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o8kbxe/dark_pool_update_june_25/?sort=top">My recent Dark Pool post showing QQQ as well as GME</a></p>
<p>Figured I should check the top 10 companies in the QQQ and compare them to the top 10 in IWF. Well holy shit if the answer wasn't immediately apparent.</p>
<p>(Tesla doesn't count because it just moved Friday as well.)</p>
<p>8 of the top 10 positions (excluding TSLA but 9 if counted) were a match.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/o04t9rmfdp771.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aeadbfdf7c510d5ce645138203c7f2d1cb6da498">That's expensive Mayo.</a></p>
<p>Fun little rabbit hole for the kids. The Gamestop power symbol looks like a Q if you turn it the right way. Wasn't there a guy editing them into videos lately? Turned and such?</p>
<p>Final edit for this part: </p>
<p>Part 2 is now here:</p>
