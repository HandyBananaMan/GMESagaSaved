Apes\n\nI know the real apes out there don\u2019t buy the bullshit but to the young apes Charles Payne is not and will never be our friend.\n\nThat theater that we witnessed was just a chess move to move closer to apes hearts so we can be manipulated on another date.\n\nSo even if it seemed awesome can we stop giving C-Payne love?",
