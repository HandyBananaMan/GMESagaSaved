    "selftext": "Apes. I'm really happy to see that Steve Cohen and Point 72 are getting some attention. While we're at it, we need to talk about the fact that Susquehanna has continued to fly under the radar. Along with Melvin and Citadel, Susquehanna has the largest short position on GME. But what sets them apart? Citadel has $35 billion assets under management. Susquehanna has $633 billion assets under management. And guess who gets those assets when margin comes calling and they're forcefully liquidated? I'd also argue that Susquehanna has likely been the biggest player behind the scenes conducting fuckery to drag this thing out. \n\nOn their 3/31 13F they showed 6,151,100 puts on GME, up from 4,882,600 on their 12/31 filing. These fuckers INCREASED their position by 25%. They deserve our attention.\n\nI get that Citadel, Melvin, and Point72 is much easier to spell, so how about this: Just use \"Sus\". It's both accurate and fitting. We need to see some lit up offices in Philly. We need DD on their positions, key players, and how they've responded over the last 6 months. And most importantly, we need memes putting them on blast and in front of every ape on this site.\n\nNo more flying under the radar for Sus.",
