This is funny enough to share given the recent posts around Charles Schwab calling customers to request them to loan out their shares. Just some further confirmation bias on this fine weekend while we await market open on Monday.

For new(ish) Apes, this is the same company whose Founder and Chairman [Thomas Peterffy went on CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TPYuIRVfew) in February and stated “I would like to point out that we have come dangerously close to the collapse of the entire system” regarding the events of the end of January.

## Program Overview (Straight copy/paste from their [website](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46942); emphasis mine)

>Earn extra income on the fully-paid shares of stock held in your account by allowing IBKR to borrow shares from you in exchange for collateral (either U.S. Treasuries or cash), and then ***lend the shares to traders who want to sell them short and are willing to pay interest to borrow them***.

Nothing really telling here, save for them targeting people who have an interest in finance/investing and are over 21 years of age living in the US; so feels pretty generic unless there's something more targeted going on in the background.
