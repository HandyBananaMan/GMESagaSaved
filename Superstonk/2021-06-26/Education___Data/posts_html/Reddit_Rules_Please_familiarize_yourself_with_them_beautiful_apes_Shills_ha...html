<p>As stated in the title, I believe shill’s have started breaking Reddit/Superstonk rules willingly to try and bring our sub down.</p>

<p>For anyone not familiar with them please read them, if you see anything that breaks them pls report it!</p>
<p>Also keep in mind our own r/Superstonk rules.</p>
