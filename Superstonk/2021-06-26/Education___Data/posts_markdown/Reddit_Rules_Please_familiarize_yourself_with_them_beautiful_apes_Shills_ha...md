As stated in the title, I believe shill’s have started breaking Reddit/Superstonk rules willingly to try and bring our sub down.

[Reddit rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)

For anyone not familiar with them please read them, if you see anything that breaks them pls report it!

Also keep in mind our own r/Superstonk rules.

I have been living here 24/7 the last couple months, I don’t wanna loose this sub to stupid stuff like this.

Thanks apes and watch out.
