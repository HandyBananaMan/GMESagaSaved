Here he looks sad, scared, tired, confused, and unwell.  \n\nThis was obviously prerecorded, he hit some good points to win the hearts and minds about education, kids, Chicago history. \n\nFrom a lightly trained ape I see some issues.  He has no clue what he\u2019s reading, he hasn\u2019t reviewed it.  He looks shook, maybe missing some sleep. I showed this to some apes and they said what\u2019s his angle he doesn\u2019t do anything for nothing.  My counter was he can\u2019t ignore an award especially if it\u2019s a prerecorded message written by his or person.  He had to \u201cshow up\u201d or cause some concerns.  He likely had to do this fo save face and keep the sharks at bay.  \n\nI don\u2019t think ken is a master liar, I think he lacks the poker face and determination to lie and keep the lie.",
