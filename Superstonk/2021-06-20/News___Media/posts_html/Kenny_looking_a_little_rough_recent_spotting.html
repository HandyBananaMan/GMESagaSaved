<p>Ok so if you go back to congressional hearing he looked scared, if you go look at different interviews with msm he looked confident.  Here he looks sad, scared, tired, confused, and unwell.  </p>
<p>This was obviously prerecorded, he hit some good points to win the hearts and minds about education, kids, Chicago history. </p>
<p>From a lightly trained ape I see some issues.  He has no clue what he’s reading, he hasn’t reviewed it.  He looks shook, maybe missing some sleep. I showed this to some apes and they said what’s his angle he doesn’t do anything for nothing.  My counter was he can’t ignore an award especially if it’s a prerecorded message written by his or person.  He had to “show up” or cause some concerns.  He likely had to do this fo save face and keep the sharks at bay.  </p>
<p>I don’t think ken is a master liar, I think he lacks the poker face and determination to lie and keep the lie.</p>
