I noticed that all the big bank stocks lost a lot of value on January 14th, but GME hasn't risen until around January 20/21 a week later.

Over the last week (5 days) the big banks lost a lot of value:

**Goldman sacks: -7.58%, JP Morgan: -7.53%, Citigroup: -11.75%, Wells Fargo: -8.46%**

All are also negative in Fridays after hours
