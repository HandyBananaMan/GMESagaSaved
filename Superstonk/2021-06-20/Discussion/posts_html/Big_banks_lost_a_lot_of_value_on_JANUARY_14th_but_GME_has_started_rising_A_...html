<p>I noticed that all the big bank stocks lost a lot of value on January 14th, but GME hasn't risen until around January 20/21 a week later.</p>
<p>Over the last week (5 days) the big banks lost a lot of value:</p>
<p><strong>Goldman sacks: -7.58%, JP Morgan: -7.53%, Citigroup: -11.75%, Wells Fargo: -8.46%</strong></p>
<p>All are also negative in Fridays after hours</p>
