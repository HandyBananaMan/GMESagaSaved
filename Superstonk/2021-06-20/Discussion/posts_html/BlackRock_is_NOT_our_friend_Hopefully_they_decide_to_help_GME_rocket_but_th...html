<p>BlackRock had over <strong>$8.68 trillion</strong> in assets under management [<a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/annual-report/blackrock-2020-annual-report.pdf">December 31, 2020 financial statement</a>] in more than 100 countries across the globe. </p>
<p>BlackRock has a division called the BlackRock Investment Institute (BII).  <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/blackrock-investment-institute">See Here</a> .  The BlackRock Investment Group's job is to tell BlackRock what is going to happen around the globe and direct BlackRock where to invest money by predicting political events </p>
<p>The Chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute is <strong>Tom Donilon.</strong> A former National Security Advisor and advisor to current President of the United States</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom Donilon’s brother, <strong>Mike Donilon</strong> is also A Senior Advisor to our President {<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/20/joe-biden-names-white-house-personnel-legislative-chiefs/">link</a>} providing guidance on what policies should be implemented within the administration.  Mike Donilon guides the focus of spending, budgets, regulation and white house policy.</li>
<li>Tom Donilon’s wife, <strong>Catherine Russell</strong>, is the White House Personnel Director {<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/20/joe-biden-names-white-house-personnel-legislative-chiefs/">link</a>}.  In that position Donilon’s wife controls every hire in the Office of the Presidency.</li>
<li>Tom Donilon’s daughter, <strong>Sarah Donilon</strong>, who graduated college in 2019, now works on the White House National Security Council {<img alt="link" src="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9702887/Obamas-ethics-chief-criticizes-Biden-string-family-related-hires.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailus" />}. Out of college for 1 1/2 years and she is on the NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.</li>
</ul>
<p>So BlackRock's Tom Donilon’s job description is to: “<em>leverage the firm’s expertise and generate proprietary research to provide insights on the global economy, markets, geopolitics and long-term asset allocation,</em>” and he is a Presidential Advisor, his wife is in charge of White House personnel, his brother is Senior Advisor to the President, and his daughter is on the National Security Council. </p>
<p>Watch where BlackRock puts their money and you can predict what might be happening soon in the world. It is very dangerous to have such a huge corporation with so much control in the government. I am sure they have many Senators and Congress Critters from both parties in their pocket also.</p>
<p>This is the company buying up Real Estate all over the country and I have seen articles coming out advocating for people to not own property but to be RENTERS. </p>
<p>So hopefully they help with MOASS, but will probably gain much more moeny and power. I plan on putting my moass money into off the grid living and convert it to things other than USD currency.</p>
