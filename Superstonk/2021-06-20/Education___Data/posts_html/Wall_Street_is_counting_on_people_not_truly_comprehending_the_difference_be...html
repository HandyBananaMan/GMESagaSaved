<p>I know for the wonderful quant apes and number apes this is basic crayon 101.So, while I am in no way a number ape, I want to share with other non-number apes a practical sense of how extremely far apart million, billion, and trillion are from each other.</p>
<p>I think it very important that Apes understand how vast the difference is between million, billion, and trillion in order to recognize possible Number FUD and make informed decisions.  </p>
<p>Some have argued that our floors are ridiculous and impossible. <em>(Number FUD)</em> </p>
<p>I hope to demonstrate that the scale of the numbers that Wall Street works with and has acquired -vs- Main Street - the difference between the two are not even on the same planet so to speak.  <strong>A million or so dollars is but a wee drop in the oceans of trillions.</strong> </p>
<p><em>When writing this I discovered that large numbers have different names in "long scale" and "short scale".</em> <em>I am using the "short scale" names for this discussion.</em> </p>
<p>A million use to be part of the massive number club - but now it is a housing price. </p>
<p>However, and most importantly, a billion and a trillion are such massive numbers, that most people don't realize just how significant the difference is between all three numbers - other than a comma or two and some extra zeros. </p>
<p>Units of time can make it easier understand on a personal level how massively the numbers increase rather than gradually.</p>
<h1>01 Thought experiment to visualize $100 thousand as a starting point to compare one million, one billion, and one trillion:</h1>
<p><strong>“If you saved $100k a year with no taxes, no spending, and no interest - it would take you:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>10 years to become a millionaire, </li>
<li>10,000 years to reach billionaire status, </li>
<li>10,000,000 (yep million) years to reach trillionaire status.”  <em>Fun tidbit - Jeff Bezos is expected to become the world’s first trillionaire in 6 years.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Math with lots of zeros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 years multiplied $100,000 per year = $1,000,000 (one million dollars).</li>
<li>10 thousand years multiplied by $100,000 per year = $1,000,000,000 (one billion dollars)</li>
<li>10 million years multiplied by $100,000 per year = $1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion dollars)</li>
</ul>
<h1>02 Visualization with 1 second of time as a starting point to compare one million, one billion, and one trillion:</h1>
<ul>
<li>60 seconds = 1 minute</li>
<li>One Hundred seconds = 1.67 minutes [100/60sec]</li>
<li>One Thousand seconds = 16.67 minutes [1,000/60sec]</li>
<li>One Million seconds = <strong>11.57 DAYS</strong> [1,000,000/60sec/60min/24 hours]</li>
<li>One Billion seconds = <strong>31.71 YEARS</strong> [1,000,000,000/60sec/60min/24hours/365 days]</li>
<li>One Trillion seconds = <strong>317.10 CENTURIES</strong> <em>(31,709.79 years)</em> [1,000,000,000,000/60sec/60min/24hours/365 days/100years]</li>
</ul>
<h1>03 Thought visualization of a house price (no other fees inc.) as a starting point to compare one million, one billion, and one trillion:</h1>
<ul>
<li>A million ($1,000,000) - you could buy ten $100k homes and is one thousand more than one thousand. 10^(6)</li>
<li>A billion ($1,000,000,000) - you could buy one thousand $1Mil homes and is one thousand times more than a million. 10^(9)</li>
<li>A trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) - you could buy one million $1Mil homes and is one thousand times more than one billion. 10^(12)</li>
</ul>
<h1>04 Stack 'em up. For those who think in visual terms of distance rather than quantity.</h1>
<p><img alt="I heard you like green crayons" src="https://preview.redd.it/wj0y6wqquh671.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ff758e113453c6b1492becd53cb142f6fb56c35" /></p>
<p>If $1million in <strong>$100</strong> dollar bills stacks up to 40 inches (3.3 feet), and $1billion is 40,000 inches, $1trillion in $100 dollar bills is 40,000,000 inches high, which is 631 miles.</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong> $Magnitude of 7 Floor is not a meme</p>
<p>edit: The whole point of this was to demonstrate why you need to HODL and not get number fudded. And I forgot my damn tag line.  </p>
