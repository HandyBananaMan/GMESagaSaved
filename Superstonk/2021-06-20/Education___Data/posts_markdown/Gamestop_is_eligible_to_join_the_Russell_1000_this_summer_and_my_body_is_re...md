What's good apes, enjoying your weekend? I'm coming at you with some good vibes and nice charts relating to upcoming market events that *could* positively impact $GME.If you're feeling tired, done with the blatant manipulation, frustrated at it all, hang in there and share my enthusiasm for a minute, let me jack them titties baby.

Coming up next on our schedule of *Why This Stock Is The Best In The World*, we got;

* T+ cycles about to cycle back on that ass, *skrrrtt*
* Our new CEO starting Monday June 21
* Gamestop is going on a hiring spree and has **NFT's in the works**
* Possible confirmation that Gamestop is loaded with **a** **BILLY** of fresh cash money

What I'd like to talk about is the Russell 1000 rebalancing and why I think it could be very fun to watch. *Like I'm not glued to the ticker everyday and will be watching anyway...*

# What is the Russell 1000, and why do we care about rebalancing?

The Russell 1000 Index represents the top 1000 companies by market cap in the U.S.Every year this index is redefined to reflect market changes and companies are evaluated as to where they stand. Rank day fell in May, and on June 4th the changes started to be communicated to the marketplace and will be made official after market close on June 25th (my B-day, whose banana do I have to succ to become a billionaire on or before then smh).  This rebalancing event brings some real volume with it, and as Dave Lauer said "is the craziest day in the stock market".

Now, I'm a visual learner so after reading and browsing the FTSE Russell site for a bit, I'm like, let me spark up this crayon and go check the charts on this shit to see what the market moved like last time.

I looked up the top 10 holdings of the index (as of end of Jan this year) and rolled them boys back to last June, to the start of the week after rebalancing, pinpointed with the cursor to June 29.As you can see below, these tickers fucking **FLEW**. Most had sexy green days the Monday after rebalancing, and had noticeable increases for the following couple months.Now, keep in mind as I had to that these are some boomer-ass stocks when looking at the movement and percentage increase. We're used to double digit swings in a few hours and I had to remind myself that's actually *not normal* for most stocks in the market. My pants are getting kinda tight just thinking about what it could be like with $GME in the mix.
