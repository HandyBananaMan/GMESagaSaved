<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I recall from another post I saw that there were 4457 puts at $200 today.  Maybe that is why they fought so hard to drive it under $200.  But they failed as we closed over $200 so these 4457 puts expired worthless today, and it cost them big money that they just flushed down the toilet!🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀</p>
