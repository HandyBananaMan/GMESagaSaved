Jellyfish here, I want to dive into what I view as a problem now, but is only going to get worse if not addressed moving forward.

GameStop has an E t h e r e u m address now, that’s not speculation of fact, it’s verifiable on nft.gamestop.com  0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e

[Even has the logo](https://preview.redd.it/ud1q57l1ks871.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad700bebb212329f454452d721ea6e0af6faa477)

But if I say GameStop’s ‘E t h e r e u m with the word spelled’ address is 0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e in a post or comment, auto-ban.

I know it’s not as sexy as the Reverse Repo numbers every day, but this is where a sizeable chunk of the money raised from the share offerings is headed. The community should be able to show as much excitement about where our company’s money is going to be spent (in an area driving this fundamental transformation no less), as we are about where our future tendies are now.

If we want the crypt0 dividend to deliver us to the promised land, we should be able to talk about the fundamentals of E t h e r e u m freely, as it is just as tied to GameStop now as all the macroeconomic stuff we get excited for in the sub every day.

Like yesterday, [E T H surpassed B T C in daily active addresses](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/obv6di/e_t_h_e_r_e_u_m_surpasses_b_i_t_c_o_i_n_in_daily/)! That is fantastic, and I want to know that the ultimate backend engine of our fundamental transformation is kicking names and taking ass!

If this were about say whatever cloud provider they want to use to power international shipping(as an example), and 1 of the big 3 was picked to power the infrastructure, and we had data for or against, you bet there would be a robust discussion.

We need that robust discussion here on this new fundamental that the company is spending money on. Yes, they are probably going to have some awesome L2 solution to show us, but again it is all going to tie back to E t h e r e u m.

Mods, I hope you consider changing this and potentially adding a member to the team with crypto knowledge as the lines are blurry now but they’ll be completely blurred after 7/14.

Thanks and hope everyone has an awesome day!
