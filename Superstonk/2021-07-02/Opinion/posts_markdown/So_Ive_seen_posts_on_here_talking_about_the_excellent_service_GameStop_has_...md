# Title: So I've seen posts on here talking about the excellent service GameStop has been providing, I wanted to share my own. My old controller died, and I needed to replace it. I ordered a new one online at 6:45PM expecting to get it tomorrow, and they DOOR DASHED IT TONIGHT!!!! Talk about one happy ape.
