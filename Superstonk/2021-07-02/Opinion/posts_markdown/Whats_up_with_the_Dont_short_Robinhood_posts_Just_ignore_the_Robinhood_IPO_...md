The sudden increase in posts warning of shorting the IPO in case they squeeze it seems so strange to me.
Why would anyone frequenting this sub even be thinking about the IPO, let alone wanting to throw away money shorting it.

If anything warning about a potential squeeze may trick people into actually going long on the fucking thing.

Just forget Robinhood altogether. Let them go down in lawsuits and loss of customer base
