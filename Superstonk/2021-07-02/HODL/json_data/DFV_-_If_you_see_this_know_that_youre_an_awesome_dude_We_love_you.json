I know you can't talk, probably for legal reasons, but you still got our backs. And we know. \n\nKeith, you aren't a cat, but you sure are a great dude. You are liked by Korean ants to Canadiapes. You held strong even nobody trusted you. Worst, they mocked you. You are an inspiration.\n\nThe fact you were still willing to buy at 40 changed the game. I know you are just a dude, and that the pressure of having millions of people waiting for you to speak must be frightening, but I just wanted to say I respect and I care about you.\n\n\"I like the stock\".\n\nThank you.",
