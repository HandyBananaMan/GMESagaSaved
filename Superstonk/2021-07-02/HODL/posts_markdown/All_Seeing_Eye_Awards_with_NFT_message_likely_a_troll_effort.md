Welp, it looks like the latest troll effort is now sending the ever cheap All-Seeing Eye awards with a message about an NFT being issued in the recipient's name. There's already been two posts, and we will likely see more soon.

It is highly unlikely that this is a legitimate offer of anything of value. It's likely a troll effort capitalizing on the NFT interest to get apes all excited over nothing.

Please be aware of this, and be suspicious of everything. Trolls love doing their thing and giving them any energy is rewarding their efforts. Just ignore it and move on with the buying and HODLing.
