<p>Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes across the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>This was the third day of ridiculously low volume, and our Diamantenhände held strong. The power of apes to HODL is truly astounding - we know what we like, and we like the stock. Reverse-repo participation was down after the end of the quarter, but is still <em>extremely</em> high. Today is July 2, and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange as we prepare for the US pre-market to open!</p>
<h3>🧱🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀🧱</h3>

<p>FAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie and converting to USD. Today's EUR -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.18505035. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.</p>
<p>Many among the Diamantenhände community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Last weekend, DerGurkenraspler appears to have deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!</p>
