So. 

How does a pass-through brokerage lose $1.5billion in 3 months?

Because they had to buy your shares and pay you for your profits when you transferred out. 

They never owned $#!%...

I brought this suspicion up back in March here:

Don't forget that they charged you to transfer out. Even that didn't offset a fraction of it. They were coming out of pocket to cover what they owed you.

According to Page 11 of their Summary of Risk Factors:

**"Our failure to properly handle cash, securities and cryptocurrencies held on behalf of customers could harm our business and reputation."**

If the SEC let's them IPO without auditing their journals, they are telling the entire US Financial market that this type of behavior is perfectly acceptable for a brokerage to engage in.

It's been spelled out for months. Do something...

And we really need the mods to sort this thing out of not being able to link from other subs. We are missing out on old DD that we can't share with new apes that was created before this sub existed.
