Best believe if I have the funds to make this happen I will try to do it. I want to meet all you wonderful Apes, and what better way to meet than throwing an epic post MOASS party at a rented out stadium. 

Throw out some ideas like have sign guy come out and do a Ape news network update, maybe ideas for musicians to hire to perform or whatever. 

Getting excited just thinking about it lol
