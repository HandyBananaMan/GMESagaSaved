I want to meet all you wonderful Apes, and what better way to meet than throwing an epic post MOASS party at a rented out stadium. \n\nThrow out some ideas like have sign guy come out and do a Ape news network update, maybe ideas for musicians to hire to perform or whatever. \n\nGetting excited just thinking about it lol",
