His second tweet at the end of the month is to tell us this is not a coincidence. \n\nJust my opinion. But If true the stock will have to be bought 10x over at whatever price we set. Something is coming, we can all feel it. My tits are gonna bleed off before the 14th if something isn\u2019t announced over the next few days. \n\nEither way this is going to be a long great weekend! What a great way to fuck up the SFH\u2019s weekend!\nCan\u2019t wait to see the fireworks on the fourth, and the fireworks the day RC decides to drop kick the nuke launch button.\n\nEdit: I added this is in the comments but wanted to add it here. By biggest confirmation bias is the fact that gamestop sold 10 million shares on two seperate offerings in the matter of days on low volume. We don\u2019t know the exact timeline but I\u2019m guessing it was better than a million shares per day. So we\u2019ve had non stop buying for 6 + months, not to mention what was bought before all this started, plus what was bought in the run up January. Just quick simple dirty math says there are lots and lots of shares sold = Godzilla",
