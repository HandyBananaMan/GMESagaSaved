<p>So. </p>
<p>How does a pass-through brokerage lose $1.5billion in 3 months?</p>

<p>Because they had to buy your shares and pay you for your profits when you transferred out. </p>
<p>They never owned $#!%...</p>
<p>I brought this suspicion up back in March here:</p>

<p>Don't forget that they charged you to transfer out. Even that didn't offset a fraction of it. They were coming out of pocket to cover what they owed you.</p>
<p>According to Page 11 of their Summary of Risk Factors:</p>
<p><strong>"Our failure to properly handle cash, securities and cryptocurrencies held on behalf of customers could harm our business and reputation."</strong></p>
<p>If the SEC let's them IPO without auditing their journals, they are telling the entire US Financial market that this type of behavior is perfectly acceptable for a brokerage to engage in.</p>
<p>It's been spelled out for months. Do something...</p>
