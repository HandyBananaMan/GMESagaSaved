<p>Hey apres! I'm happy to report that I've successfully completed my 30 day alcohol rehab and am home and feeling great! </p>
<p>I was able to check the ticker price a few times a week, but haven't been on the sub or able to read any news. So what did I miss? Give me some of the highlights for the month if June. Any drama, news, best memes, anything! </p>
<p>It's good to be home and back in with you guys! I missed you all so very much!</p>
<p>EDIT: I am just blown over with the amount of encouragement, support, and well-wishes from all of you! Thank you to every one of you that stopped by! I am a very proud ape today, and feel so very loved. You guys are the best!</p>
