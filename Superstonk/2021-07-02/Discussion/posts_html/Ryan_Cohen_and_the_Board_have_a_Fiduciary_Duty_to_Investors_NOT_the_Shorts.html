<p>I keep seeing this idea posted that Ryan Cohen issued new shares of GameStop so, get this, shorts have a chance to cover so that GameStop could say that they offered the shorts a way to prevent a market collapse due to MOASS. </p>
<p>I’d just like to remind everyone the board of directors Fiduciary duty is to us, the share holders. Not to the people shorting the stock or the SEC or the DTCC. </p>
<p>Maybe I will stand to be corrected here. However I can’t fathom why this theory is even considered plausible, let alone has almost 10k upvotes on the front page.</p>
