# Title: As we near the end game, let's take a moment to resync on the sensitive topic of Theoretical Floors (Yes, the 10M floor). I present "The Dangers of Groupthink: THE OMEGA BRRR CLUSTER AND THE 10M DOLLAR FLOOR". TLDR - Can 10M happen? Yes, but make sure you understand the conditions of "HOW".

Before you read the post or skip to the TL;DR

* I hope you guys like the name I chose for the DTCC/NSCCs "computers" that handle liquidation and covering during the margin calls: **The Omega brrr Cluster** which will likely be a key component of the squeeze that will be what solidifies this event as "THE" MOASS in all of past or future history
* Also, this is not what I would consider "traditional" Due Diligence (DD).
   * While this DD is not going into depth on answering questions related to what will happen with GME and why, it is my own due diligence in helping we all ensure we are all exercising our own basic due diligence for the betterment of the community, which is also important for MOASS
* Finally, This goes into some potentially unknown and unacknowledged concepts
   * It may unavoidably add to your uncertainty, which may result in some apes labeling it as FUD, but part of the main theme is to acknowledge uncertainty, and learn until you are not uncertain, reducing your Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt
   * There is also a section in the TL;DR around FUD to clarify my views on it

# After reading the above, continue here or skip to the TL;DR at the bottom

This post is basically an expansion on a psychological theme of a [separate DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6zw24/counterdd_to_the_theory_that_when_dtcc_margin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I have been putting together that is focused on theorizing how the NSCC (DTCC sub that handles trades for member defaults) when the poor HF or corporation's liquified assets cannot cover the cost of their final bill (such as when the covering of these positions triggers a short squeeze. For the few of you who started following me and are waiting for the "2.0" Version of that DD am planning to post THIS IS NOT THAT.

Intention was to dig into DTCC/NSCC's Recovery and Wind-down procedure, report findings, and identify other variables that will factor in to the true peak and pattern of the MOASS so I could build 2.0.

Now, back to the post:

This DD is just expanding on the theme that, if an ape believes in something (Like a 10M floor), that ape should know the evidence or logic behind "WHY" they believe in that. The goal here is to avoid  [groupthink syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) and not let it take hold in the community.

# Ways to avoid Groupthink:

* Always assume that assumptions are wrong
   * Theories are inherently based on assumptions (assumptions are necessary to make them), just don't forget about the ones in play
* Question outcomes/conclusions you don't understand
   * This is the best way to learn and improve arguments
* Become learned
   * Apes Strong Together, but Learned Apes Together Are Even Stronger
* Suppress and route out fallacy with reason (not emotion)
   * The point here, is, if you are going to call something out be constructive
      * Ape no fight ape

# The 10 Million Dollar Floor and the Omega Brrr Cluster

I made this primarily in response to the prevalence of the widely cited "$10M floor" posts and comments that are being presented with definitive language and zero context, which I think can be damaging and misleading to apes here if they get the wrong idea and do not read any actual DD. 10M is certainly possible, but the thesis behind the 10M floor never said that it was unconditionally guaranteed.

It has also been widely assumed that the DTCC will let the Omega Brrr Cluster settle all trades, and that they will just pray that they, the markets, and the global economy are still in tact by the time the computers are done going brrr. This is possible, but there is nothing saying that they definitely have to go this route when there is a Crisis Continuum ([last DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6zw24/counterdd_to_the_theory_that_when_dtcc_margin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) goes into this a bit). Basically, they have flexibility to "un-wind" in a situation like MOASS, so we cannot assume just yet that they will go this route.

# What is [Groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink)?

**"Groupthink** is a psychological [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon) that occurs within a [group of people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group) in which the desire for harmony or [conformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity) in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) outcome." -some guy on wikipedia

Photo from inside Shitadel I took once:

![Not sure WTF is going on here, but I think you get the comparison. ](https://preview.redd.it/k8obmr8h66y61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dacf4fd32c1c7f937b6d3b11bc22b6b437a9016)

For the smooth-brains, the duck in this case is the 10M floor and belief in what the Omega Brrr Cluster will do. Let's say the guy holding the duck has a good reason, the guy behind him is his wife's boyfriend, and the third guy's brain is hella smooth, so he just does the same as the second guy. Guy 4, who is not a smooth-brain, walks in for his first day at he office but doesn't have the balls to ask wtf they are doing so he just claims it is normal and follows suit. By the time guy 5 gets there, even reasonable people would assume there is probably a good reason for what they are seeing, so they add to the train, and by person 6, the situation is fu\*ked and only Guy 1 and possibly his wife's boyfriend know why he is holding the duck. Guys 3-6 are just echoing the behavior.

I wouldn't be surprised if this part of the reason why hedgies started piling on to short GME without accounting for the possibility that the Apes would be lying in wait, ready and willing to go full retard at the right moment and destroy them. Should have done your DD hedgies, see you in hell.

# Narrative:

While finishing my taxes with my financial advisor (below) who was not yet up to speed on the GME saga. I don't remember why I put a hat on him, but here we are.

![Captain Gubert \\"Gooby\\" \(my advisor\)](https://preview.redd.it/8ilwxlxki5y61.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aad9d490a450b10d72f647cce42acf785355a26)

I found myself having to explain to him the reasoning behind my near 100% portfolio diversity on a certain stock I liked, so I started showing him the DD to help explain. Since cat brain > smooth-brain, he understood and supported the move. We then got on the topic of price targets. During his own research on reddit he mentioned repeatedly coming across posts about $10M floors, and asked where that number came from. I referred him for DD behind that number, which he accepted, but he brought up an excellent point.

Imaginary conversations aside, we must all keep in mind that the $10M floor is dependent on a number of conditions, one being, but not not limited to, all apes going full ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ.

Other factors to the above:

* DTCC/NSCC wind-down strategy
   * If MOASS gets far enough and is costly enough to force the DTCC/NSCC to start paying (once the assets they have liquefied run out), they have the flexibility to "unwind" this situation however they want to
      * We can theorize, and widely believe, that they will let their computers settle all outstanding trades as fast as possible, liquidating all Hedgie assets and the assets on credit that the prime broker let them buy on margin, unleashing what I call the "OMEGA BRRR CLUSTER" and letting it liquidate and  indiscriminately cover at any price until all positions are settled, but there is no language that dictates they use this strategy, especially once NSCC has to dip into its own account.
      * The NSCC response to the failed margin call is what many believe will let MOASS being to rip, potentially causing a domino effect, knocking out pretty much everyone still short on GME. "How" they actually respond is up to them, so until they start responding, we cannot say whether MOASS will be a rocket or a slow-but-steady ride to the peak, and even then, predicting the peak will not be difficult.
* Trade activity of market participants not part of the ape community
   * Day traders
   * Robot traders
   * Institutional investors and trade firms
   * Etc.
* Current Short Interest
   * We know Short interest is insane, but we do not have exact figured on how short the different participants are
      * The true short interest (the amount to cover) will influence how high this can go (the more the better)

These are just some of the known factors, but expect there to be many more, both known and unknown.

# Takeaway so far:

Hopefully, what you have taken away so far is that apes should be encouraged to look out for their best interest and ensure that we are not becoming victims of [groupthink syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) (this also is in our collective best interest). Regardless of each individual's price target, we can also benefit from more knowledge. I truly believe that is is important to acknowledge the possibility of the unknown and that you do not have the full picture in a given situation. While acknowledgement of the unknown WILL increase your level of uncertainty, especially if the information is alarming, but once you have acknowledged what you are uncertain about, you can work to understand it and reduce your fear, doubt, and uncertainty all at the same time.

I am not here to present what I think some of these signals are exactly, as that section of my brain doesn't have enough wrinkles yet.

# WRAP UP

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

My hope is that enough apes will see this and acknowledge the  importance of keeping an open mind, and that if apes are going to pick a floor, they should at least have reasoning on why they chose it, and will adapt if circumstances during MOASS invalidate certain theories. What I don't want is for apes to perpetuate the idea of that a specific floor or target is a fact, and I especially don't want to see Ape on Ape action every time one ape disagrees with another apes thesis. We should be excellent to each other, try to be constructive, and remember that no outcome is impossible.

![That is the Ape-logic equivalent to checkmate to any statement saying that something is impossible. Who knew Audrey Hepburn was one of us too?](https://preview.redd.it/yyfxqo7966y61.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb595a4c8f9d40e0fe1941b77d3395ae84b6e5a)

***Disclaimer: These are just my opinions and represent how I would answer these questions if put on the spot. My goal is not to suggest a floor/plan or get anyone to change their current floor/plan. Feel free to provide your own thoughts on my answers, but know that these are not the primary focus of the DD.***

>Q: Is a >10M a possible peak to the MOASS equation?  
>  
>A: Certainly. Any number is theoretically possible, however, Ape diamond hands are not alone on one side of the equation (if it was, we could set any price and rocket until the gov steps in or we delete the market), but even if it was, it still assumes that nearly all apes ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ this, which itself is not logical to blindly assume. I personally am in favor of the Infiinity Squeeze theory, and will be following that until new information confirms the theory is no longer valid.

>Q: Is a >10M peak an unconditional guarantee?  
>  
>A: If you haven't been reading up to this point, No \^\^\^. Anyone who tells you that this is an unconditional guarantee (good intentioned or not), does not have your best interest in mind. Someone with your best interest in mind will generally try to give you the information needed to come to your own conclusion, and may also give you the conclusion they came to based on that. If it happens that all apes come to the same conclusion on their own based on the info they have available, then all the better.  
>  
>Q: Are we able to currently predict, with high accuracy, what the MOASS will look like throughout the ride from the start to the end?  
>  
>A: No. The market is already too complex to accurately predict, let alone an event as unprecedented as this one. We need to continue our  DD and work on putting together theoretical models/patterns that can explain the many possible price patterns we may see, so that we can construct the true picture of the MOASS in real-time and as more info becomes available. I hope our wrinkle-brains and hone this as we go.

>Q: How long will MOASS take from Rapid Ascent->Peak->Descent->End?  
>  
>A: Due to the rules around trade halts on around extreme volatility, and the sheer amount of shorts % that needs to be covered, it is very likely that MOASS will take days, or even a week to finish in a Rocket Ascent/Descent situation. It could also be a slow-burn (IMO a very

When I was a boy in Bulgaria last February, I exercised a GME call option while my account with was in RobbingHood last when the price was \~$330, thinking it would continue to moon**, which soon fell to \~$40. I held, transferred to Fidelity, averaged down my position, and awaited the real squeeze.

Personally, I plan to hold until Shitadel and the Toxic Market Participants have all been shredded by the **Omega Brrr Cluster** and are bankrupt. From there, i will likely look for the indicators that confirm that the Squeeze is Squoze, pick a floor, and sell once it hits.

# Notes/Acknowledgements around FUD

* **I anticipate that some apes may label this post as FUD**
   * If you think this post is intentionally or unintentionally generating FUD, know that this was not my goal, and feel free to call out anything that is sus so that I can refine my wording and improve my wording in the future
   * If disagree with my own take on FUD and are adamant that this Post is FUD (which is against the rules of r/superstock) I'd honestly encourage you to just report it, and if it in-fact is FUD, the mods will take the appropriate action
* **I plan on writing more DD in the future that will unavoidably generate uncertainty, as it  often will go into unknown or misunderstood concepts**
   * Know that **Uncertainty** is often just the reality of a situation, but do not confuse this with **FUD**
   * It is natural to feel fear or doubt as you learn and acknowledge new information, but it is important to NOT let that uncertainty stick around  and cause fear and doubt fester
   * Learn more about what you are uncertain about so that you can minimize your fear, uncertainty, and doubt and strengthen your ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ
   * If you have a problem with the content, I would rather fix it and make it unquestionably  ape-friendly
* **Things I consider FUD**
   * Content that was written and overtly ill-intentioned, and seeks to exploit fear, uncertainty, or doubt in order to generate more FUD in readers and the community
   * Content that may be good-intentioned (not clearly ill-intentioned) that presents information that inherently increases uncertainty that is not backed by logical reasoning or guidance and can only really result in a negative impact
* **Things I do not consider FUD**
   * Content that acknowledges Fear, Uncertainty, or Doubt, but provides logical reasoning and guidance with the end goal of reducing FUD among readers rather than promoting it

# TL;DR

**These are the takeaways I was going for:**

* **The Omega Brrr Cluster**
   * The Omega Brrr Cluster is my name for the DTCC computers that will go HAM once hedgies are failing Margin Calls, and is one of the key factors backing up the 10M floor and the Infinity Squeeze thesis
      * This is because it is believed that the Omega Brrr Cluster will Liquidate everything they can buy as much GME as they can at any price
      * Keep in mind, there is no guarantee that the DTCC/NSCC will resort to this method, as they have the flexibility to wind-down the position in a way that hopefully does not break the market (More DD to come on this)
* **Be aware of Groupthink Syndrome**
   * Don't be afraid to question what you don't know but pursue the answers to those questions and do not let it fester into doubt
* **Be careful about blindly accept that MOASS will peak at or above a specific price**
   * Definitive language on floors/peaks in the community that does not acknowledge the conditions that make this possible are most likely detached from the original context of the theory, and should honestly be ignored (remember, know the reason "why" before you support something
* **The final peak is not an unconditional guarantee**
   * We cannot know the peak before the peak actually happens
   * If you choose to support a particular thesis around a certain price target, I'd encourage you to gain a basic understanding of the reasoning behind the thesis, not just the outcome
* **If you think this post is FUD I'd encourage you read the section above the TL;DR so that it is clear where i stand on it**
   * Feel free to disagree, call me out, or event report the post to the mods if you think it is damaging to the apes in the community
   * I am always open to feedback

Edits:

1. reworded the TL;DR in hopes of keeping the messaging and takeaways more consistent with the rest of the post 
2. Removed the smooth-brain edition of the TL;DR
3. Cut a couple sections that detracted from my primary goal, which was NOT to influence, suggest, or debate on our personal floors.
4. Added section clarifying my views on FUD
5. Formatting

Thanks for checking out the post. And remember, Apes are strong together, but learned Apes together are even stronger. Happy to hear and respond to feedback.
