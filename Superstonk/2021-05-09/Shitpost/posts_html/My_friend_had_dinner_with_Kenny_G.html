<p>The other day I showed my friend (26) some DD about GME. Eventually we got to the topic of Ken Griffin. My friend said that when he was a kid, his dad took him to a dinner in downtown Chicago (city where he was raised) and he met Kenny G at his penthouse. </p>
<p>Naturally, I asked more about what Greedy Kenny was like in person. My friend was young at the time so he doesn't remember much from the dinner except for one thing - Kenny G refused to share his mayo. This mega billionaire had only one dipping bowl of mayo at his dinner with 15+ people and kept it all to himself. He wouldn't let anyone else have any mayo. Fucking mayonnaise, of all things.</p>
<p>TLDR; Kenny G is and has always been a greedy scumbag that won't share his goddam mayo.</p>
