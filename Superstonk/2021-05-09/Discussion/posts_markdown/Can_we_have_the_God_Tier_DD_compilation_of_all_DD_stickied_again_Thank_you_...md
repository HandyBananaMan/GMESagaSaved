The AMAs could be linked within the God Tier DD. Could even rename it God Tier DD + AMA.

Also, you mods have done an amazing job inviting these experts to talk about this saga. What a way to share knowledge and boost our credibility!

The "I voted" flair was such a great and fun idea too.

And thanks for keeping this sub as "clean" as you can. Fighting shills and downvote bots ain't easy, I can tell.

Everyone, be kind to each other. Ape no fight ape.

🚀🚀💎🖐🌕

Side note, whoever has been giving snek awards to shills, you an MVP 😂

Edit: my first gold award 🥺 thank you anonymous person
