What a way to share knowledge and boost our credibility!\n\nThe \"I voted\" flair was such a great and fun idea too.\n\nAnd thanks for keeping this sub as \"clean\" as you can. Fighting shills and downvote bots ain't easy, I can tell.\n\nEveryone, be kind to each other. Ape no fight ape.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udf15\n\nSide note, whoever has been giving snek awards to shills, you an MVP \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: my first gold award \ud83e\udd7a thank you anonymous person",
