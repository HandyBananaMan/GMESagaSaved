<p>The AMAs could be linked within the God Tier DD. Could even rename it God Tier DD + AMA.</p>
<p>Also, you mods have done an amazing job inviting these experts to talk about this saga. What a way to share knowledge and boost our credibility!</p>
<p>The "I voted" flair was such a great and fun idea too.</p>
<p>And thanks for keeping this sub as "clean" as you can. Fighting shills and downvote bots ain't easy, I can tell.</p>
<p>Everyone, be kind to each other. Ape no fight ape.</p>

<p>Side note, whoever has been giving snek awards to shills, you an MVP 😂</p>
