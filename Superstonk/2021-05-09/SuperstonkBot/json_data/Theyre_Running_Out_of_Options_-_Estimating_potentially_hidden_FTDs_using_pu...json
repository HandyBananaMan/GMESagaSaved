If you don\u2019t wanna read any of it I guess just hodl until Jan 21, or at least wait for a bankruptcy or two. Basically there are so many ways to indefinitely roll FTDs into the future, the number of actual fails in GME, and maybe the whole system Idk, is pretty much a measure of Wall Street\u2019s integrity.\n\n//\n\n**Okay, so**\n\n1\\. Options Options  \nI\u2019ve been digging through\u00a0[GME options data](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?expiration=2021-04-30-w&moneyness=allRows)\u00a0for a while, and I found some, uh, colorful numbers. I\u2019m hoping someone less autistic than I am can tell me why they smell like horse shit.\n\nMost of GME\u2019s expiry dates,\u00a0**EXCLUDING**\u00a07/16/21 and 1/21/22, are pretty boring. Not only are there low volume and open interest, there are far fewer strikes with interest,\u00a0*especially*\u00a0at sub $50 strikes. But for July 16 and Jan 21, strikes climb in $0.50 increments up to $5.50. Most other dates begin $5, usually moving in $5 or $10 increments.\n\nAlright I\u2019m losing you already so I\u2019ll back up and explain as I go along. If you know this shit already skip to - (???????? ????????)\n\nEach option contract (call or put) represents a non-obligational right to buy (call) or sell (put) x number (usually 100) of shares for an agreed upon price (strike price) per share, by an agreed upon expiration date.\u00a0**These are contracts, not shares - owning the right to buy/sell has an opposing obligation to deliver/purchase.**\u00a0This means that options traders are not required to buy contracts before selling them. Typically the trader will instead buy 100 shares of the underlying security to \u201ccover the call\u201d.\n\nThis is one reason why looking at open interest data is useful. Open interest is the number of contracts yet to be settled at some expiration date, and the options data I linked above shows the interest of individual strike prices within that date.\n\nContracts can be settled (and thus OI decreased) in 3 ways: 1) they can be exercised (buyer exercises his right to buy/sell), 2) they can expire worthless, 3) the seller can purchase the option back from the market\n\nBtw notice how I said \u201cmarket\u201d and not \u201cbuyer\u201d - that\u2019s because when a contract\u2019s seller buys to close, the market (the OCC) fills his buy order (bid) with a random seller, even if one of his original buyers has a sell order (ask).\n\nThis is largely for two reasons: 1) So a trader on Citadel\u2019s trading floor can close his position without waiting for individual RobinHood buyers to sell their calls, and 2) to prevent a trader from just buying calls from Phil down the hall (this will come up later, surprise lmao ofc he still can)\n\nOptions chains are usually organized by strike prices at different expiration dates, and every buyer has a seller, so even if a trader buys to close, the overall OI on $60 calls will only decrease if he manages to buy back calls he originally wrote, otherwise that interest is just shifted to Credit Suisse or whoever sold.\n\n**This means that, even if a trader\u2019s initial option position is closed, the option will still have interest until all buyers decide to sell.**\n\nNote: Options are typically organized by strike and expiration, but that\u00a0**does not mean**\u00a0all traders trade at single strikes. A trader can fill my 250k order at $60, or he can tell me to fuck off and write 50 calls at every strike from $40-$60, adding more room to hedge and possibly making liquidity easier.\n\nSo remember how I said there were options on 7/16 and 1/21 in 50 cent increments up to $5.50...\n\n(????????????????)\n\n2\\. ETFs\\, FTDs\\, WTF  \nThis is probably where you may want to break out the tinfoil...\n\nBy looking at an\u00a0[option\u2019s price history](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME%7C20210716%7C0.50P/price-history/historical)\u00a0you can see when that option began trading, hinting at when the option was originally written, and almost every option within those weird 50 cent increments began trading just after the 2020 dip in March, with some going back further into 2019 at very low activity until March 2020. Note GameStop was trading around $3.50 before the March 2020 drop. These March dates aren\u2019t regular, either. Most other options were not traded until November, 2020.\n\n\\*\\*\u00a0*cue speculative cutscene*\u00a0\\*\\*\n\nNow, if I\u2019m Phil the Hedge Fund Manager in March, 2020, looking at brick-and-mortar GameStop, a company I\u2019ve been short for years on that\u2019s now trending into the dirt BEFORE a global pandemic \u2014 and I\u2019m watching all my friend\u2019s brick-and-mortar short positions furiously shitting Benjamins, what better way to print free money than just sell bunch of calls and wait for the iNeViTabLe bankruptcy? Mother Nature just broke into the ICU and stuck a knife in GameStop, says Phil, so if any of the calls are executed I\u2019ll just borrow the shares to cover them for a measly $350 per contract and maybe I\u2019ll borrow some more to deliver the first batch I borrowed. What? FTD? Is that like FYE?? Ehh who cares GME will be in retail heaven with Blockbuster and Toys Were Us by January. Flu season in a pandemic?? I\u2019ll see you in Barbados boyzzzz\n\nMAYBE Phil, with Ponzi-the-money-printer, earns his firm, Edgar Capital,\u00a0[**60 PERCENT RETURNS IN 6 MONTHS**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://fintel.io/ip/melvin-capital-management-lp)\u00a0and now his bosses who earned 10% last year are literally asking him to fuck their wives. And their daughters. In Barbados.\n\nMaybe things start to get\u00a0[a little tense](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://images.fintel.io/us-gme-fails-to-deliver.png)\u00a0toward the end of September. Just a month ago Phil thought FTD was an STI and now people are calling him Margin Capital online :(\n\nNow seems like a good time to talk about what exactly happens when a trade fails. If your trades fail all the time already, skip to -\n\n(????????????????????)\n\nIt might be helpful to think of any given hedge fund or capital group as.. less like a chess grandmaster and more like the guy who sells hotdogs downtown at 2 am. He picks the street, maybe he makes the chili, but unless he\u2019s selling to a restaurant, he\u2019s kinda fucked unless people stumble up to him. He\u2019s got some wieners in stock, but if there are more buyers than wieners, he might take their money and tell them to come back tomorrow for their hotdogs.\n\nNow picture millions of these bastards huddled inside their Broker-Dealer Cafeteria\u2019s, all stuffed inside Market Maker Superdome selling and promising food all day to orders coming in - add a few more superdomes and replace hotdogs with stocks, ETFs, options, blah blah that\u2019s basically the stock market.\n\nTo set the scene, it\u2019s late August, 2020, and Grandma buys a share of Monster and at the end of the day, Phil has no Monster. Usually Phil\u2019s BD will lend Phil its shares (or just create them..) for a day or two, and if he doesn\u2019t find Grandma\u2019s Monster by then then, he must declare a fail-to-deliver. Well Phil has amnesia and after two days he just declares fail-to-deliver. Phil now has 3 days to find the Monster or Phil\u2019s Market Maker (who clears the BD\u2019s trade), on the fifth day, will force the BD to buy one with his money.\n\n*Unless*\u00a0that BD vouches that Phil\u2019s a kind, forgetful guy, in which case Phil gets to tack on another 3 days.\n\n[This SEC document](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)\u00a0goes over these guidelines btw I\u2019m not just spitballing\n\n*In a shocking twist of events*\u00a0- Apple buys Monster and now Phil\u2019s fucked. There are no shares to borrow and Monster is too expensive to buy.\n\nLet\u2019s say the BD\u2019s Market Maker is Phil\u2019s wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s brother - and honestly the MM has so many shares he wipes his ass every day with them every day, so - if there\u2019s an ETF (basically a veggie burger of shares) containing Monster, he can use his MM authority to throw some Monster into a 50,000 share burger called a creation unit, then sell it to BD as a new share of the ETF. BD trades the ETF to Phil, who\u2019s been holding the BD\u2019s share so he doesn\u2019t fail to deliver, then Phil plucks a Monster seed from the burger and\u00a0*voila*\u00a0Monster is on the books - Phil shows the BD the MM\u2019s shares, winks, and the FTD is settled. On paper.\n\nThe DTCC is the final clearing destination for most US trades. They allow 35 calendar days for MM\u2019s to settle, so Phil rented the MM\u2019s extension and the MM is trusting Phil to find Grandma\u2019s Monster in 35 days. When he does, he can sell the newly minted ETF share back to the MM, the MM puts the shares back in their places and it\u2019s all roses and ????????\n\nOh btw, to tie in the hotdog guy analogy, you probably won\u2019t be surprised to know that the Superdome owns a lot of the Cafeterias inside. Many Market Makers\u00a0*are*\u00a0Broker-Dealers. This reduces internal regulation, and, because these trades are often beneficial for everyone except Grandma, they can potentially be abused.\n\nOkay to keep things realistic, let say Monster\u2019s only ETF is the Wedbush Addictive 50 ($WADD) and holy shit, Apple is in there too. Just before the ETF-burger move, the MM is out of Monster and and Phil\u2019s fuckedfucked\n  \n\n  \nIn this situation, Phil can simply offer his wife to his MM, in which the MM can build the WADD as a creation unit of IOU\u2019s, called an\u00a0[ETN](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.investopedia.com/investing/etfs-vs-etns/), from which Phil can pluck the Monster IOU, and\u00a0*voila*\u00a0- Phil\u2019s has a happy Grandma and a happier wife\n\n(????????????????????)\n\nMMs generating ETFs and ETNs as a means of lending less-liquid securities inside, is well covered in\u00a0[this presentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://youtu.be/ncq35zrFCAg). This is one way to conceal fails, but they\u2019re not\u00a0*entirely*\u00a0hidden - the fails may still show up within the ETFs.\n\n**As I understand it, if this were the case with GME, or any security, you would expect repeated spikes in ETF fails, \\~6-8 days after the security fails.**\n\nOf course this would smell like bull shit from a mile away, so there are a few other ways fails can be kicked down the road. They\u2019re not my secrets lol both of my great grandparents are still alive - the SEC warned about them in 2103:\n\n//\n\nSide note on ETN\u2019s:\n\nETN\u2019s are, by definition \u201cunsecured debt obligations\u201d - and they have legitimate benefits. As debt obligations they also have risks, as\u00a0[this presentation from 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://youtu.be/ncq35zrFCAg)\u00a0discusses.\n\nI have a concern I really hope someone can ease for me. A short position is a debt obligation, so wouldn\u2019t borrowing to cover a short create a collateralized debt obligation? And if ETN\u2019s are basically virtual, unsecured debt obligations,\u00a0**wouldn\u2019t repeatedly using ETN\u2019s to cover short positions create a synthetic collateralized debt obligation?**\n\nYes I\u2019m unashamedly using 2008 hot words, and maybe I shouldn\u2019t, but considering the (albeit extreme) example at 28:00 in the video I linked above, when XRT (ETF containing GME) reported 78m ownership of 11m outstanding shares -\n\nThat\u2019s a security-stew of 11m veggie burger bits floating in a broth of 67m promises. Priced by the pound.\n\nI genuinely hope this FTD shuffling tactic isn\u2019t accidentally (or otherwise) creating synthetic CDO\u2019s. Remember the Asian dude Michael Scott\u2019s alter ego almost strangled in a restaurant over how completely autistic derivatives of synthetic CDO\u2019s were? Wouldn\u2019t that just translate to all options contracts and other derivatives involving ETF\u2019s??\n\n//\n\n3\\. It Often Rhymes  \n**If you don\u2019t read another word of this post, please please save**\u00a0[**this SEC risk alert from 2013**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)\u00a0**to read for later.**\n\nThat document reviews the FTD settlement guidelines that I went through earlier and discusses two other known methods of concealing fails: married puts and buy-write transactions.\n\nReminder that this is all in relation to GME\u2019s first big FTD spike in September and the July/Jan  share price), essentially replacing the short position (shares are needed to exercise)\n\n**In either case, as with ETF/ETN schemes, the trader who was short is essentially paying the MM for access to the 35 day settlement exception.**\n\n(??????????????)\n\n4\\. What You Know For Sure  \nBack to September. Hedge funds and Market Makers have been turning retail short sales into Ferraris and Ivy League athletic scholarships for the past 6 years. They successfully\u00a0[strangled multiple businesses into bankruptcy](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://stockhouse.com/news/newswire/2016/01/19/how-short-sellers-are-killing-companies-and-market). multiple businesses into bankruptcy and now flu-season was approaching amid not only a global pandemic, but a global microchip shortage that completely halted distribution of GameStop\u2019s single biggest sales driver: gaming consoles.\n\nIts important to note that the market is a dynamic system that is\u00a0**intentionally**\u00a0confusing. There are hundreds of multi-million dollar firms placing thousands of bets, and generating liquidity through short selling is a genuine part of a MM\u2019s job.\n\nThat said, through BD/MM affiliation\u00a0**that benefits both parties, even if caught and fined**\u00a0- the potential for 1 or 2 disingenuous traders to begin contagion is a legitimate threat.\u00a0[This video originally from 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://youtu.be/I0WXg5T3cBE)\u00a0describes this in more detail.\n\nThis is highly speculative and I should probably leave it out but fuck it\n\nIn my opinion, given ample opportunity, deep fucking incentive, sound rationalization, and chicken shit regulation - it is seems possible that, on a market wide scale, 100+ million shares that should have failed-to-deliver are quickly, and sometimes fraudulently, shuffled \u2014 via married puts, buy-writes, ETF manipulation including ETF/ETN creation units from a Market Maker, and writing naked calls \u2014 to maintain the virtual appearance of buying/borrowing shares to settle the FTD.\n\nThe fuck was I saying\n\nOh yeah September\n\nBack in August,\u00a0[short interest reached $426 million](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/). Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but at \\~$4.70 share price, that\u2019s over 90 million shares sold short. If that\u2019s accurate, that\u2019s uhh.. a little aggressive there, chief\n\nSo by September, fails start rolling in. Phil is seeing FTD tags in his nightmares -\u00a0*Fuck, how many calls did I sell? How many shares do I have? Are those shares borrowed? What the fuck is a DTC??*\n\nAt this point, Phil has to decide between:\n\na) cutting his possibly massive losses and unwinding one of the biggest cash cows beneath the\u00a0[64+ billion dollars](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29U00R)\u00a0hedge funds made in 2020, or\n\nb) paying a small fee and risking another small fee to double down and stay short\n\nOh, let\u2019s not forget that cold/flu season is approaching amid, not only a global pandemic, but a\u00a0*global microchip shortage*\u00a0that will probably slow distribution of GameStop\u2019s single biggest sales driver: gaming consoles.\n\nMaybe Phil was smart and got out. Obviously his friends didn\u2019t. 4.2 million shares failed in 2 days, October 13-14, and the 30m share Niagara Fails of December and January suggests some quadrupled down in October.\n\n5\\. Everything in the World is Magic\\.\\.\\.  \n**Here\u2019s a puzzle:**\n\nAssume someone wanted to use some of the the neat and totally legalish tactics I so concisely described to indefinitely roll FTDs into the future \u2014\n\nUsing public data, estimate just how heinous GME\u2019s actual rolling FTD number\u00a0*could*\u00a0be.\n\nI\u2019ll shoot for a realistic degree of atrocity\n\n**(my limited understanding of) The Rules:**\n\n-Roughly, ( beneficial ownership ) \u2014 ( shares outstanding ) = ( total shares owed )\n\n* Broker-Dealers have 2 trading days after a client is short to cover.

Eventually\\, Trust Fails  \nWhat in the depressing fuck kind of title is that\n\nAnyway remember when Phil\u2019s MM made a WADD and Phil traded his wife for it?\n\n[XRT\u2019s Options data](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/XRT/options?expiration=2021-05-07-w&moneyness=inTheMoney)\u00a0reveals \\~51k call OI over 11 dates, 45k of which are concentrated in only\u00a0**3**\u00a0dates: 5/21, 6/18, and 9/17. Notice how those dates fit nicely between 7/16 and 1/21, the two dates housing half of GMEs call OI.\n\n*tinfoil time*\n\nKen sells calls and hedges and juggles FTD\u2019s and Ken plans to pretty much do it until he retires. Well when those $69,420 calls expire, he should still have the one share he had to buy as a hedge. If he gave that share to Phil to cover both their asse(t)s he needs to either buy his share back or find another one. Well Kenny\u2019s no rookie - he\u2019s been doing slight-of-shares with ETF\u2019s since, like, 2006 - so he buys or whips up or promises to whip up an XRT burger and everything\u2019s ???? and ????????.\n\nYeah that\u2019s not gonna make sense if you skipped the foreplay, sorry.\n\nWell the only thing better than XRT is free XRT, so Ken can just sell cheap XRT calls, forcing delta hedges on XRT, then crack open the XRT and allocate the GameStop.\n\nBut even if all 50k XRT calls were hedged with 100 shares, GME is only 7% of XRT. So 5m XRT shares equates to 350k GME shares...\n\n*Allow me to introduce:*\u00a0[IWM](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/ishares-trust-ishares-russell-2000-etf)\n\nIWM is the iShares Russel 2000, and they announced a 15% increase in GME on 2/25/21. Funny, I didn\u2019t hear much about it.\n\nIWM holds GME at a humble 0.35%. Take a guess at what\u00a0[IWMs options chain](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/IWM/options)\u00a0looks like...\n\nYou\u00a0*may*\u00a0not guess a call OI of\u00a0**1.56 million**\u00a0over the 15 expiry dates from now until 1/21/22. Hedging those at an average of 50 shares/call represents 78m shares. At 0.35%,\u00a0**thats 2.7m GME shares**.\n\nBy the way, if an extra 2.7 million shares available to extend shorts, purely in call hedges, doesn\u2019t shake you, remember GameStop is in over\u00a0**60 different ETFs.**\n\nOh and it gets better\n\nI\u2019ve been talking about calls for a while but\u00a0*puts*\u00a0exist too. If you somehow managed to read through this whole post you\u2019ll remember what the SEC said about married puts...\n\nThe\u00a0**put OI**\u00a0for IWM, up to 1/21, is\u00a0**3.7 million**. \\~750k of those puts are at-the-money. With GME at .35% of IWM, that potentially represents 2.6 million GME shares capable of floating FTD\u2019s via married puts in IWM.\n\nMarried puts\u00a0*should*\u00a0have ATM puts to maintain the short position, but they don\u2019t need to be ATM to settle a FTD - one reason MPs are used over just re-borrowing (and the reason they\u2019re illegal) is they function by claiming one asset as collateral in two transactions. There are 100 shares married to the put (risk-less position to skirt regulation) and the same 100 shares are used to close the FTD.\n\nThe MP provides the paperwork loophole but it\u2019s not necessary for the short position. Phil can just borrow shares (\u00a0[IWM shortvol% was apparently 74% on 4/30](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/http://shortvolumes.com/?t=iwm)\u00a0), buy a worthless put to marry and instantly divorce, and now you did the paper magic and are still short. Maybe they call it a one night stand Idk\n\nThe total put OI of all strikes with over 10k OI is over 2.5 million.. there are puts at dozens of strikes trading for $1. If\u00a0**ONE THIRD**\u00a0of those were used for disposable MP\u2019s, that\u2019s another 2.6 GME shares.\n\nWhich is interesting, considering GME has\u00a0[329k put OI at the LOWEST 2 STRIKES on 7/16 and 1/21](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options?expiration=2022-01-21-m&moneyness=allRows&view=stacked_ohl). Even more interesting about those 329k puts - when they were being gobbled up in late January, \\~200k of them, they averaged their highest prices of all time.\n\n50 cent puts... While GameStop was soaring. Went from $4 in December to $15 on Jan. 28. Right.\n\nGuess I could take a shot at that puzzle now.\n\n**Total potential-shares-for-allocation estimate:**\n\n-Citadel delta hedging call order flow: 10.5m\n\n-[The suspected Buy-Write trades](https://web.archive.org/web/20210504013036/https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lylvrb/update_35_1625_million_of_deep_itm_gme_calls_have/): 14,500 calls = 1.4m shares\n\n-Citadel delta hedging IWM calls: 2.7m\n\n-Married puts in IWM: \\~2.6m\n\n-Married puts in GME: up to 32m.. but I\u2019ll leave these out\n\n**Total:**\u00a017.2m GME shares\n\nIf\u00a0**half**\u00a0of these were actually used to roll fails, 8.6m + the 4-5m already rolling in the FTD data + 11m reported short volume = \\~26 million shares sold short\n\nIncluding the GME puts and everything else - it\u2019d be \\~64 million.\n\nAnd\u00a0*excluding*\u00a0married puts, Citadel has access to over 13m GME shares, solely from delta hedging GME and IWM calls, to potentially distribute among shorts about to fail.\n\nDo not forget that I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m not an expert in this stuff, I just had surgery two months ago and it pisses me off when shit doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nThese people have been playing this game for years and I\u2019m sure there are dozens of other ways reversals can be achieved, they get fined like 100k for this shit and without it.. well if it\u2019s bad enough they\u2019ll go bankrupt.\n\n//\n\n**My point here is - where there\u2019s smoke there\u2019s fire, and there\u2019s so much smoke in these numbers I can\u2019t taste the purple in my lunch.**\n\nObviously none of that was advice or conclusive I can\u2019t even spell conclusive\n\n//\n\nAll this shit is meant to be be confusing. The internet revolutionized trading, especially options. In fact they started becoming popular in the 90\u2019s, right around when ETF\u2019s came along. The SEC talked about two ways options could be used to hide FTD data - and I liked a presentation talking about how ETF\u2019s can be used to do the same thing. The AMA last week mentioned it, too.\n\nAll of these loopholes serve to provide Citadel, who claims to clear 99% of options order flow, with enough shares\u00a0*merely in hedges*\u00a0to juggle 13 million fails. Add to that buy-write transactions, married puts, naked calls, ETNs, and all the other autistic things possible in a system so complex, who tf knows how many shares they might be juggling on paper.\n\nThe options, to me, look like a smoking gun. Fails in GME\u2019s ETFs repeatedly fall between fails in GME, suggesting some number of fails are being rolled with ETFs. The number of ETFs with institutional ownership over 100% 6 months ago suggests many of those shares used to cover came from ETNs.\n\nThe fact that the bulk of call OI in IWM and XRT falls neatly between the call OI in GME suggests these options are, in some capacity, related to rolling fails into the future.\n\n**THAT SAID -**\n\nRegulation changes increasing margin requirements or decreasing settlement times, would begin to unwind these positions. And-\n\nA share recall would bring the buying pressure of every IOU floating around because of this horseshit.\n\nA bet on GME is a bet again Wall Street\u2019s integrity.\n\nBut - don\u2019t just trust me on this stuff, seriously, use the links, find some bullshit that looks weird and ask yourself why it\u2019s weird. I promise, there\u2019s lots of weird shit. Start with the 1500 $1.50 calls someone bought / Citadel sold for 1/21.\n\nAnd the 100k 50 cent puts that\u00a0*weren\u2019t*\u00a0bought in January probably traded for under $5 so I\u2019m sure plenty of that is legit. On the other hand, I do remember a post saying put OI in early March was obscenely high but I can\u2019t find it anymore.\n\nIf you just scrolled on down here and read the \u201cmy point is\u201d part, no worries. The post was just some bullshit anyway - 11m reported shorts is an infinite short/float % because there is no float.\n\nOh and if really read this whole fucking thing, message me and I\u2019ll fly you to dinner next year.\n\n---\n\n***This is not financial advice!***  \n*This post was **anonymously** submitted via **[www.superstonk.net](https://www.superstonk.net/)** and reviewed by our team.\nSubmitted posts are unedited and published as long as they follow r/Superstonk rules.*",
