    "selftext": "**An overview of the deplorable Mr. Ken Griffin**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy fellow apes,\n\nI believe it was Sun Tzu who said \"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.\" That is what we face every trading day, as the saga of GME continues.\n\nI am keen to inform you further about the antagonist of this story (though I'm sure as a likely narcissistic psychopath he doesn't see it that way). I am talking about **Mr. Kenneth Cordele Griffin**, founder, chief executive officer, Co-chief investment officer, and 85% owner of Citadel LLC - a man estimated to have horded a wealth of **$22.4 billion**.\n\nIn case you are unaware, Citadel LLC are thought to be the primary short-sellers in the GME debacle, where they predatorially gave loans to Gabe Plotkin's company to prevent margin calls at the GME peak in late January of this year. Their relentless pursuit of profit has landed them in rather hot water this time, as I personally don't believe they ever wanted the public to be aware of their practices, nor they unbelievable amount of money they made at the cost of American jobs, businesses and livelihoods.\n\nGiven Mr. Griffin is both CEO and 85% owner of Citadel, I think it is only fair to say he guides the operations of his business, and the operations are therefore reflective of his values. If you agree, it is therefore fair to attribute praise/blame (99% the latter) to the man who oversees all in this company.\n\nSo, please join me in reviewing Mr. Griffin as a man, in both his personal and business affairs. In doing this research, I have personally been sickened by what sort of a man has risen to the top of the US pyramid, but I will leave it for your deliberation - enjoy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Personal life**\n\nBought the most expensive home in the US ever ($238m penthouse in NY), money that could have been used to help millions of others out of poverty, or maybe pay for almost 1000 $250,000 homes for those affected by the 2008 crash:\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-most-expensive-home-ever-sold-us-nyc-penthouse-2019-1?r=US&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-most-expensive-home-ever-sold-us-nyc-penthouse-2019-1?r=US&IR=T)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh wait, more multimillion dollar houses because of course you need those:\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-real-estate-nyc-apartment-record-chicago-london-miami-2019-1?r=US&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/ken-griffin-real-estate-nyc-apartment-record-chicago-london-miami-2019-1?r=US&IR=T)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOwns $800m+ in art, instead of giving it to charity or allowing it to circulate through the economy:\n\n[https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-industry-news-june-4-2020-1878852](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/art-industry-news-june-4-2020-1878852)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGriffin owns **two** private jets: a 2001 [Bombardier Global Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_Global_Express) valued at $9.5 million, and a $50 million 2012 Bombardier Global 6000, so he hates the environment too:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/photos-how-citadel-billionaire-ken-griffin-spends-his-fortune.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/photos-how-citadel-billionaire-ken-griffin-spends-his-fortune.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe HATES being taxed, because having a fair amount of money would be unfair apparently:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/11/05/battle-of-the-billionaires-failed-illinois-income-tax-initiative-drew-more-than-110-million-from-governor-jb-pritzker-and-citadels-ken-griffin/?sh=6046e7302da4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/11/05/battle-of-the-billionaires-failed-illinois-income-tax-initiative-drew-more-than-110-million-from-governor-jb-pritzker-and-citadels-ken-griffin/?sh=6046e7302da4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe believes that people should be able to make unlimited contributions to politicians, but that these contributions should be public (P.S.

I'm sure even worse occurs behind closed doors. KEN GRIFFIN HATES YOU.**\n\nOverall, Ken Griffin was likely hoping he would never be in the limelight, but here we are (BTW please share this far and wide so people know how much of a deplorable piece of s\\*\\*t scumbag he is). He is, both in business and pleasure, a disgusting, greedy, angry, cheating human being who deserves to be in jail without a cent to his name. GME is your last chance to even get close to punishing these people. The American system has ensured the ivory towers of smoke and mirrors are built, and the final bricks that will ensure invincibility lie here - KNOCK THE CITADEL DOWN AND USE THE BRICKS TO BUILD HOMES, SCHOOLS AND HOSPTIALS.\n\n*If anyone has any more additions/changes (there will be loads because he's truly detestable), please message me and I will edit.*\n\nThank you for reading. Please GME to the moon, and hopefully Ken to jail \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n*Edited for readability*\n\n*Disclaimer: all of this information was available online.
