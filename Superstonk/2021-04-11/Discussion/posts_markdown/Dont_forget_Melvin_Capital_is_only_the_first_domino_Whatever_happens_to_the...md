Should Melvin still be as balls-deep into shorts on $GME, as all indicators seem to point to, their margin call and subsequent liquidation could send the price of the stock up as far as $520-$700. 

That is if they're forced to completely liquidate and lose all of their assets on covering naked shorts for GME. 

We may see it spike that high and settle back in the $300's or maybe just the $200's... they'll say that was the real squeeze, that $200-$250 is now fair value for the stock (remember when Zacks changed their tune to say $170 was a decent point? Bet my left cheek it ain't.) 

It could go a bit lower if the other short funds decide to short at the top of that run up. 

***Either way, day trading this stock is too unpredictable and it's price doesn't behave normally. Don't do it.***

Point is, don't fall for the seeds that are already being planted that Melvin is going down fast, and that the squeeze will really be squoze once they cover their shorts. 

There are several other parties that backed and bailed Melvin out of their January fuck up. A few names such as Susquehanna and Citadel's many branches will be playing from the shadows. 

Look back at everything that's been building. Remember that they will twist everything they can into FUD. 

The reason why I personally like and believe in this stock hasn't changed since [I purchased my first share at over $500,](https://imgur.com/a/W00OPEY) and it hasn't changed at any point since, so why would I sell?

Keep your game faces on, and remember, whenever you see some crazy new DD, good or bad, ***always***  to ask yourself why it's it's being announced, who stands to benefit from it, and what it wants to get you to do. 

See you all on the moon!

*(Mods, pls let me know if that screenshot proving I bought at over $500 is against rules and I will take it down, just want to be able to validate my claim!)*

Edit: I always wanted to have a train run on me, but this is ***not*** the way I pictured it.

Edit 2: Since I've been told by a couple of people that there's stuff going around encouraging day trading/etc., I'll keep it simple. This ape only knows and does two things: buy and hodl.

I've been training my 4 cats to do the same and recommend it to everyone else who owns cats. Only. Buy. And. Hodl.
