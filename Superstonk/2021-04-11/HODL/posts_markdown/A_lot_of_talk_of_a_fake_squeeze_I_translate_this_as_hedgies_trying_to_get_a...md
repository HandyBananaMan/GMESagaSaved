# Title: A lot of talk of a "fake squeeze". I translate this as hedgies trying to get apes to day trade and try to consolidate their positions. They want liquidity, don't give it them. Buy and hold.

Seriously, it crossed my mind "if it goes to 1k and I know it's going to drop I can get more shares". Then I thought this is what they want.

Buy, hold, not financial advice.

Peace and love!

Edit: A few people are commenting a fake squeeze could kill them. It certainly could! I'm not saying will or won't happen üíÅ
