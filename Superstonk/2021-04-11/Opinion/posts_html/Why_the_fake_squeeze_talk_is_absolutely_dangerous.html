<p>If people believe there will be a fake squeeze, they will be tempted to daytrade. "</p>
<p>Oh, I'll just sell for profits now, and then buy back on the dip!"</p>
<p>No no no.</p>
<p>You like the stock, you buy and hold it. Don't believe this FUD. Very dangerous. Any selling while rocket is priming can hinder the full effect of the squeeze.</p>
