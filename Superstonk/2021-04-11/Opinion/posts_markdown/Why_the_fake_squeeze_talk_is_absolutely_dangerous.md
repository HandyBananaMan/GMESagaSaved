If people believe there will be a fake squeeze, they will be tempted to daytrade. "

Oh, I'll just sell for profits now, and then buy back on the dip!"

No no no.

You like the stock, you buy and hold it. Don't believe this FUD. Very dangerous. Any selling while rocket is priming can hinder the full effect of the squeeze.
