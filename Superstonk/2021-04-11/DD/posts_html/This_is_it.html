<p><strong>This is it.</strong> (imagine) the squeeze is over. </p>
<p>In a matter of some days your wealth rocket from some thousands into the Millions. Congratulations, you are the first Millionaire in your family. Yes YOU, a retarded ape, who never saw 5 or 6 digits in your bank before. And now? How do you keep your new wealth, keep it away from (greedy parts of) family, friends, the government and from financial crisis? Hire a financial advisor, who take 2% a year from your hard fought tendies? HELL NO! (Besides the advisors, that you need for your legal stuff and taxed) Some wealthy guy once said: “it`s easy to make money, but it´s hard to keep it.”</p>
<p>In this post I´ll talk about some different assets, you can invest into, that will keep and grow your wealth (No financial advice bli bla blub).</p>
<p>Since I´m an europoor, I´ll mostly write in € and kilogram (for weight), since the numbers are just for getting a feeling…it shouldn´t be a problem (in case just convert them). Also I excuse for any mistake in spelling or writing. </p>
<p>Now to the assets, these assets are: </p>
<p>- Stocks                     - Land</p>
<p>- Real estate             - Foreign currency</p>
<p>- Diamonds              - Exotic assets</p>
<p>- Precious metals    - Crypto </p>
<p>- Cash</p>
<p>First of all, it´s a bad idea, to just let your winnings laying around at your bank, inflation eats on it, if your bank goes bankrupt, you are fcked. So first have a look, until which sum your money at your bank is backed up by government. In Germany (German ape here), it´s mandatory 100k € + volunteer higher back up from bank. Don´t let large amounts of money lay over this backed up number or it could be, that you wasted this once <strong><em>ever</em></strong> event. </p>
<p><strong>Stocks:</strong> Why you should immediately invest some of your gains back into the stock market: Since we all know, how big this thing and shitadels fuckery is, it´s pretty sure, that $GME will drive the rest of the market down, a boomer stock blood bath, or how we call it: A FIRE SALE! Reinvesting into stock only has advantages, we´ll get back into the market at a much cheaper price, which will also stabilize the whole market, when Trillions of $ get back into the market, reddit just saved the global economy! </p>
<p>-But what stocks should I pick, I only invested in $GME so far?</p>
<p>There will be a lot of cheap tech stocks on a sale, feel free to pick your favorite and watch them grow. Also you can pick some dividend aristocrats, to get a safe quarterly side income and a very safe and stable stock. Also you can save the wealth of your family and future generations with setting up some cheap Index funds (with xx,xxx-xxx,xxx$), which will grow over the time and also make your grandchildren millionaires.</p>
<p><strong>Real estate:</strong> Only buy it, if you know how to do and if you can easily afford it, don´t spend all your money on one property. And don´t make the Kenny G., you don´t need x expensive houses, that require monthly maintenance and slowly eats on your wealth. Only buy a property to live in, if you can easily afford it. Otherwise just buy real estate, if you plan to rent it out or to flip and sell to a higher price. Why? Ever heard of somebody, getting rich with real estate? Obviously. Ever heard of somebody getting rich with his/her property? There you go…draw a clear line between <em>your</em> house and a income generating real estate asset of yours.</p>
<p>Can´t tell you more about how to find and buy a good property, never bought or owned a property (small, young ape here).</p>
<p><strong>Diamonds:</strong> (read Edits before Diamond segment) </p>
<p>Edit: Good comment from u/dutchretardtrader about diamonds, that I didn't knew so far: "The natural ones may be getting harder to dig out of the ground, but the DeBeers company which has a practical monopoly on the supply side has an enormous stash of it, which they're sitting on to keep  the price high and stable.
The industrially produced diamonds are just as good as the natural ones, but DeBeers is doing everything they can with propaganda, serial numbers etc. to convince people that somehow the natural ones are 'better' than the industrial ones. It's a losing battle (and then there's the ethical aspect of natural diamonds, ie blood diamonds, poor working conditions of the miners), and at some point DeBeers will probably start dumping their stash en masse on the market to drown out the demand for industrial diamonds, which will also tank the price."</p>
<p>Edit 2: some apes pointed out, that the diamond market is pretty fraud, do your own research before buying them heavily, there are a lot of other great gemstones available! :)</p>
<p>If you keep your hands of the sell button on the way up during the squeeze, you are allowed to call yourself diamond baller and are allowed to buy <strong><em>real</em></strong> diamonds. Some facts about the advantage to buy diamonds and why to diversify into them. Diamonds are small, light, easy to store, have an constant rising price and were never forbidden in the history of money and humankind. Lets say you take a million € of your $GME money and put it into Gold, now you have 20 kilogram worth of gold, have fun storing it! The same amount in diamonds in comparison would be <em>only</em> 4,4 Karat=0,88 gram! Easy to store in any safe or bank. The price for diamonds had a constant rising within the last 50 years and had returns of 4,3% a year since 1960. It´s not as much as the average yearly return of the S&amp;P 500, but we might see some higher returns in the next years, since less and less diamonds can be dig out of mines. And the last advantage of diamonds: they never have been forbidden, try to think about any asset, that wasn´t forbidden (or had some shady things going on) at any time and human history (money, gold, real estate, alcohol…). Some things to pay attention to, when buying diamonds: respect the 4 (or 6) C´s, which are: </p>
<p><em>Carat, Color, Clarity, Cut, (Certificate), (Confidence).</em></p>
<p><em>Carat= weight should be .3-.33; .5-.53; 1.01-1.3 and so on</em></p>
<p><em>Color= D-G (D is the best)</em></p>
<p><em>Clarity= IF or F</em></p>
<p><em>Cut= excellent</em> </p>
<p><em>Certificate= from the GIA (Gemmological Institute of America) makes sure your Diamond is real and you can sell it anytime, anywhere. Also every diamond has it´s own number, lasered into the diamond.</em></p>
<p><em>Confidence= only buy from legit, serious stores. When you buy, ask them, if they would by it back from you at any time. Only buy there, if the answer is</em> <strong><em>yes</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Precious metals</strong></p>
<p>Gold, Silver, Platinum and some more: Gold is one of the oldest currency on earth, since more than 5000 years, humankind used it to buy/ sell things and store wealth. Gold and Silver both have a constant value increase over years and decades. Gold and silver both stay strong values in times of deflation and financial crisis. What happens, if gold gets forbidden by the government? In the 20th century we´ve seen 9 big gold-gets-forbidden-events. 1x UDSSR, 2x Germany, 1x USA, 1x France, 1x China, 1x Poland, 1x India and 1x UK. It <em>could</em> happen again, but forbidding gold never worked and will never work out in the future. Also we live in different times, in a democratic country it shouldn´t be possible to forbid precious metals for the normal person, while the state and institutions are allowed to keep it. Why institutions? Oh well since 2008 try to guess, who bought gold <em>en más</em> to be prepared for the next financial crisis? Institutions and central banks! Since 2008 central banks bought more gold, than in the 50 years prior (2018 around 651,5 tons). Since we know about the unstable market and what could happen, if shitadel and co. starts to burn…it might be a good thought to put some of your money into gold. </p>
<p>Silver: I know, I know, Apes no like silver, but similar to diamonds and gold, it can secure your wealth and it might be an good idea, to diversify into. When buying silver, you should look at the Gold-Silver ratio, which is historically at around 60 (1 oz. Gold= 60 oz. Silver) . In early 2020 (everyone panicked and bought gold) it was at over 110, which meant Silver was compared to Gold undervalued. Atm we are sitting at a comfortable 69, nice (LOL), so Silver would be still a buy. Before buying research for the tax situation in your country and which coins or bars are the best for you!</p>
<p>Another bullish factor for the future of Gold, Silver and Platinum is the Basel-III-Rule coming into action in 2022. Banks and central banks are then allowed to put up to 20% of equity into these 3 precious metals to stabilize against crisis and to strength their balance sheet. </p>
<p>So best for ape would be: Get GME gains, put some of it into precious metals, market takes a big hit, lot of people FUD into metals, prices raise. In 2022 Basel-III comes to action, Banks buy more metals and prices raise again. Apes happy with returns and to have some of their money in a safe investment.</p>
<p><strong>Cash:</strong>  “Cash is king”, holding some of your assets in physically money has some big advantages! First: you own it, you have it in your hands and are always good to go on using it. If you have money on your bank, you don´t really own it, your bank just tells you, what you <em>should</em> own. Think about Greece last financial crisis some years ago, people weren´t able to get their money out of the banks for a longer time…do you now understand, why owning some physical money could be useful? Also your physical money is (still so far) protected against negative interest rates and in times of deflation. Also since you always have access on your money, you´ll be able to (at any time) buy cheap into other assets, if there is a good business opportunity coming up. Buy a safe for your new mansion or take a locker/ safe at your bank, that you can easily access and thank me later. In times of hyperinflation hold 0% in physical cash.  </p>
<p><strong>Land:</strong> You can take some of your money (x-xx%) and buy land, forests, grassland and fields. It won´t give you annual returns (except you rent it to farmers), but it´ll save your assets long term. With some strategically buys and in times of a constant growing world population, you might be able to sell it to a higher price later, if you are in need for money. Also how cool would it be to have your own forest to have relaxing walks inside? </p>
<p><strong>Foreign currencies:</strong> Don´t buy them heavily, maybe some small one-digit-percent number for speculations, but in times of uncovered paper currencies and unlimited money printing (central banks goes BRRRRRRRR) it´s not a good and neither a safe investment. I know, we have apes from all over the world and some counties local currencies are very unstable, if this counts for you, you might consider putting an a bit higher number in safer currencies ($/€) to be protected from your currency and government. </p>
<p><strong>Crypto:</strong> It would take a lot of time and words to write everything, since I know many of you apes know way more than me about it (never owned any), I´ll try to keep it short and simple. Even, if you never bought any, you should consider taking some percentage of your assets and put it into crypto, because it´s the future, it´s decentral (government can´t regulate it), it can´t get inflated, since there is usually a limited amount of crypto coins available. I personally would only buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, since they already have “real world use”, like buying your tesla with bitcoin or nft art with Ethereum. Just buy and hold it for the future, maybe in 10 years, you´ll be able to buy a new house in Bitcoin, which is at 200k/Coin. Who knows. As much fun Dodgecoin is…now since you are wealthy, you want to <em>keep</em> your wealth. Don´t buy coins, that you don´t understand or that don´t have a deep (fucking) value.</p>
<p>Edit: good recommendation by u/trpHolder for another coin currency: "Monero is what bitcoin dreamed to be in the beginning days. It's way more practical than bitcoin and ethereum, because the transaction fees are low as fuck and the confirmation time is also a lot faster. Bonus points also go to privacy, with bitcoin and ethereum anybody can find out how much you own if they gain access to your public key ( which is really easy, since it will be exposed when you make a transaction), Monero on the other hand is as private as it gets. People can know your public key but they will never be able to see how much you hold and how much your transactions are. (...)Monero was designed to be as private as possible and it's using a technology which makes it impossible to track transactions." 
Obviously no buy recommendation, do your own research, before taking heavy positions. </p>
<p><strong>Exotic assets:</strong> Now to the last and probable most fun one! Exotic assets, what should that be? A coconut palm farm? Buying islands in the Caribbean or a property on the Cayman islands, so you can visit our friends from the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/">everything short</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mokvhk/chaos_theory_the_everything_connection/">the everything connection</a>” lol? Nope, exotic assets usually have side effect of being hell of fun, an exotic asset could be a exotic car, a watch, whiskey, antiquities, or art pieces. Everything of these is a different market with different experts, before buying some antique furniture for an exorbitant price, you should inform and consult with an expert. After you purchased one exotic asset, <strong>treat</strong> it like an asset!!! Buying a rolex with the speculation of selling it way higher in 30 years <em>won´t</em> work, if you wear the watch every day. Driving with your old-timer/ exotic car to a $GME ape meeting-yes, going on the racing track and driving like crazy-no. Buying whisky for 50.000 and then just drinking it? NO, store it in your mansion, so you can sell it higher in 20 years. Only excuse I´ll allow for opening a bottle of the bought whisky is, if another ape comes for a visit, so you can look back at the financial war of 2021. You can have a lot fun buying and researching exotic assets, just let me tell it again: treat them as assets, otherwise, you´ll lose money! </p>
<p>Edit: a comment about exotic cars by u/ineptVirus:</p>
<p>"I think cars are a fantastic asset to the multi-millionaire investor and they are largely overlooked. </p>
<p>They are overlooked as an easy investment for a few reasons: they are large, they do require some maintainance even in long term storage, and you need to know your stuff (or know someone who does) to make a fantastic long term investment.</p>
<p>However, if you can pick a nice model, in a good condition, you can have a great appreciating asset that can sometimes even match some stocks and funds for growth of value. I think this is especially true with the upcoming electric car revolution. Remember, noone makes new classic cars! Supply is on a downward trend, demand is pretty constant. And there are lots of cars for every price point, from a few thousand to a few million."</p>
<p><strong>(Yolo with DOMO):</strong> Only relevant, if you are in the U.S, so sadly not for me. Domo capital is a Institutional investor firm, that supported us apes with information and called out false news/ media, they´ll do an AMA the the 20/04 with us. For U.S apes with 100k left, you might think about investing with them, they have good returns and are pretty smart.</p>
<p>Now on the end a short table, how certain investments tend to perform in different events/circumstances. (Took from a German financial investment book and translated it).</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/91d8gde58js61.jpg?width=1654&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cf2172387456217b88af2fc6035bf11a05a97ee">Performance of different assets during different events.</a></p>
<p>As you saw, most of these assets are real/ physical assets, I can´t tell you, how many % of digital assets you should buy (Stocks, cash at bank, crypto) vs real (real estate, diamonds, precious metals, cash, land, exotic assets), it depends on your personal risk. But generally, the higher your wealth, the more you should diversify into real assets, so you´ll “really” own your assets. The earlier you´ll make a plan in where and how much to invest (after you sold and have amount x to play with), the better. It´ll take some time and new knowledge to have your wealth spread in different assets, just try to have fun doing it and then you can just sit back, enjoy life and watch your wealth grow over time, while it´s also secure from different circumstances. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If you made a large amount of money in GME (after the squeeze!) and want to keep your wealth... just read it, seriously. I´m discussing different assets, advantages of these assets and why certain assets are important to keep you and your future generations wealthy. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ape strong together &lt;3.</p>
