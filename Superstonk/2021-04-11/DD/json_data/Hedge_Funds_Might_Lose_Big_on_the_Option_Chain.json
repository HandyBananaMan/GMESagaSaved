    "selftext": "I honestly can't believe the time and dedication I've put into GME. This DD is a representation of how much I care about my 2 shares.\n\nThe summary was going to be my morning report for tomorrow, but I've decided I'm going to write down the process I take when I think about aspects of the stock market. I hope someone finds this useful.\n\n**What is going on in the option chain?**\n\nI first make assumptions that set the boundaries of the game (Option Chain). Every action taken on the stock market is due to the actions of a player. I assume that computer algorithms are nothing but tools designed by players to take actions. Players are all human (No True Artificial or Alien Intelligence). All interactions occur between the player and the bank (I call it a bank, because it's always called a bank in a board game regardless of what it actually is).\n\nI then figure out the game.\n\nThis is a betting game where you try to guess where the stock will go.\n\nOn your turn, you will receive a Stock Price. You can then take any number of actions until you pass or the next Stock Price is received.\n\nTo take an Action, you must first choose a Stock Price, then combine a Transaction with an Option. There are 2 Transaction types (Buy and Sell) and 2 Option types (Call and Put) for a total of 4 actions. \n\nBelow is a table of the rewards each action will give you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Transaction Type|Option Type|Reward|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Buy|Call|\\+1C|\n|Sell|Call|\\-1C|\n|Buy|Put|\\+1P|\n|Sell|Put|\\-1P|\n\nAt the end of the game, you will receive a table to tell you how much money each reward is worth (I'm not concerned about this with what I'm specifically looking at).\n\nWhen the Player takes an Action, The Bank must take an Action with the same Option Type but opposite Transaction Type. Both the Player and the Bank receives its Reward.\n\nI can go on and explain the whole option chain in detail, but this is the precursory information we really need to establish the boundaries of my Game Theory. If you're reading this, I'm assuming you know how an option chain works.\n\nThe data that I'm looking at specifically is Delta. Delta is the amount of money an Action gains when the price of a stock goes up by $1.\n\nI compiled most of the Deltas from most available Option Chains. I excluded some with really low open interests to save time (I have been manually typing in data for hours and I felt I had enough data to be representative of the situation). I literally manually imputed all the numbers from TastyWorks (I know there was probably an easier way, but I had no idea where to look and I felt finding an easier solution would've taken longer than doing it the hard way).\n\nI have the following results:\n\nTotal Call Delta: 6,250,000 \n\nTotal Put Delta: -3,883,000 \n\n**Worst Case Scenario for Hedge Funds (This is virtually impossible, but it is I believe the upper limit and just hilarious to think about):**\n\nHedge Funds Bought all Puts and Sold all Calls.\n\nHard Funds Delta: -3,883,000 (Buy Put Delta) + -6,250,000 (Sell Call Delta) = -10,133,000 Delta\n\nEvery time GME goes up $1, Hedge Funds would lose $10,133,000\n\nIf GME goes up by $100, Hedge Funds would lose AT LEAST $1 Billion just in the option chain.\n\nAgain, this is virtually impossible due to delta hedging and what not, but this can give us a better sense of scale of what the Hedge Funds might be dealing with in regards to the option chain.\n\n**Best Case Scenario for Hedge Funds**\n\nHedge Funds Bought all Puts. Bank Sold all Calls and delta hedged with stock.\n\nHedge Fund Delta: -3,883,000\n\nIf GME goes up by $100, Hedge Funds would lose AT LEAST $388,300,000. \n\nThough not as much, still hilarious especially since this does not account for TENS OF MILLIONS OF SHARES that they still need to buy to close their shorts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI would estimate that Hedge Funds as a whole are losing between $3,883,000 and $10,133,000 for every dollar GME goes up in price from Options and it's probably closer to the upper end.\n\nIf GME Goes Up Back up to $483 that range goes from $1,261,975,000 to $3,293,255,000 Strictly From Options.\n\nI know there are a lot of assumptions being made here and the math isn't really that difficult, but understanding how this system works in the real world can help us better understand the situation very real people have put themselves in. This might help us understand just how desperate they may be and better understand some of the action being taken. I think it's safe to say that Hedge Funds might be fucked.",
