    "selftext": "I have some non-reddit friends who own the stock, who largely don't have any experience in the market. They don't understand how a short squeeze works, and are dubious of the high figures us apes know are possible and a certainty, because they aren't doing the DD.\n\nIf nobody sells below $10M, then that's the floor. Stop doubting the process, and instead start sending out positive vibes and support to everyone else that has doubts! The easiest way to help uneasy investors is to show them that they are not alone in this fight. The few paperhands out there will provide the bit of liquidity required for the price to go up, and the diamond handed apes will take over from there.\n\nEdit: Also don't be a dick. There is a lot of positivity in these subs, but there is just as much (or more) negativity - especially towards people who are new to all of this. Embrace that everybody has to start from zero knowledge, and help them along.",
    "title": "If you \"feel like $10M floor is ridiculous and unattainable\" then it will be. The only way this works is if enough apes have confidence and faith in one another and diamond hand like their life depends on it. Don't become a paperhanded self-fulfilling prophecy.",
