Hello, this morning u/rensole did a request in his synopsis to analyse all the Failure-To-Delivers contained in the ETFs. So I made a Python script where I get all the latest FTD data from the 72 ETFs including GME. I will from now on post the FTD data for you apes. I hope you guys enjoy it! ü¶çü¶ç

EDIT: Thank you so much for all your kind words! Love you all! ‚ù§ Have a nice weekend! üçª
