<p><strong>TL;DR  I think all the major players are leveraging real estate assets.  they can sell real estate back and forth under or over value, transferring money under the radar, raising the perceived value, raising surrounding property values, in the end giving themselves more leverage, more margin to spend.  Reminds me a lot of junk bonds.  If I can raise surrounding real estate values, my property value goes up and then i take that to the bank or my repo buddies and get a bigger loan, prob buy another property and keep riding the wave.  but none of it's based on actual values, on actual people wanting to live there or work there.  how long can it last?</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don’t understand everything but I know there’s a common thread here, and it looks like JP Morgan and overvalued assets- Real Estate.  This is really long so just hang in there!</p>

<p><strong>How is Citadel related to JP Morgan?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a revolving door they share employees, and a lot of talent comes out of UT Austin.</p>
<p>This thread explains the robinhood -&gt; citadel -&gt; JP Morgan connection (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l92ma1/jpm_citadel_and_how_slv_is_connected_major_scheme/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l92ma1/jpm_citadel_and_how_slv_is_connected_major_scheme/</a>)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Why UT Austin?</strong></p>
<p>UTIMCO. It stands for University of Texas Investment Management Corporation. Bush created it (from what I understand) and according to their own website, it was ‘’the first external investment corporation formed by a public university system.” UTIMCO has control over UT’s extensive land and oil holdings and its general endowment fund.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2002/08/bush-a01.html">https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2002/08/bush-a01.html</a>)</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.utimco.org/about-utimco/">https://www.utimco.org/about-utimco/</a>)</p>
<p>So at UT Austin, funds that are meant for the school and the students can be instead delegated to this organization, UTIMCO, which then invests the money in ventures that benefit the board members. It’s a way to move money from public to private.</p>
<p>It’s also been alleged that there may be back end access to Citadels data through a terminal at UT. Check out this awesome cryptic post if you want to go down that rabbit hole: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CitadelLLC/comments/mhimy1/61727054/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CitadelLLC/comments/mhimy1/61727054/</a></p>
<p>And Citadel basically has fresh employees on tap.</p>
<p>(SIDE NOTE: Ken also donated $125 mil to University of Chicago’s Department of Economics, apparently he’s known for this shit (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/citadels-ken-griffin-donates-125-million-to-university-of-chicago/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/citadels-ken-griffin-donates-125-million-to-university-of-chicago/</a> )</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be so great if you could take your taxable gains and donate to someone like UT, who could then put it into UTIMCO and funnel it right back to you!?!  No taxes and all the money and everyone gets a kick back. UTIMCO gets capital to use and Citadel gets data and employees.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Why the fuck is there a UTIMCO??</strong></p>
<p>Im not trying to get political at all I really dgaf about the political theater, I just need to say that GWBush approved the UTIMCO, approved the chairman, Hicks, who later repaid Bush by buying him out of the Rangers. Donald Evans was also on the board of the UTIMCO, and when Hicks retired Evans was voted in as the head. Evans later went on to be secretary of commerce under GWB. In 2008, GW used gov funds to help JP MORGAN buy out Bear Stearns.  Bush connects UTIMCO and JPM.</p>

<p>"Lehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given its size and status in the U.S. and globally. At its peak, Lehman had a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketvalue.asp">market value</a> of nearly $46 billion, which was wiped out in the months leading up to its bankruptcy.1</p>
<p>Many questioned the decision to allow Lehman to fail, compared with the government's tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=jpm">JPM</a>) in March 2008. Bank of America had been in talks to buy Lehman, but backed away after the government refused to help with Lehman's most troubled assets."</p>

<p><strong>Why do we keep seeing JP Morgan?</strong></p>
<p>JP Morgan is the common thread.</p>
<p>Just recently:</p>
<p>-JPM issues 13bil in bonds (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrm243/jpmorgan_to_sell_13_billion_of_bonds_in_largest/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrm243/jpmorgan_to_sell_13_billion_of_bonds_in_largest/</a>)</p>
<p>-Bernie Madoff dies, letters released, claims JPMorgan was complicit in the fraud. JP Morgan paid 2.6 bil fine in 2014 to settle allegations w/o admitting wrongdoing.

<p>-Warren Buffet sells shares in Banks, specifically JPM (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/16/investing/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-stocks/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/16/investing/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-stocks/index.html</a>)</p>
<p>"The JPMorgan Chase sale is noteworthy given that Berkshire partnered with the Jamie Dimon-led bank and Amazon (<a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link">AMZN</a>) on a health insurance venture named Haven, formed in 2018 but which last month <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/04/investing/haven-shutting-down-amazon-jpmorgan-berkshire/index.html">announced plans to shut down</a>. Berkshire still owns shares of Amazon." - cnn article</p>
<p>This article is from FEB 17 2021 so “last month” was January 2021.. HMMMM…….</p>

<p>JP is doing the same thing Lehman did.  They had ammmaazing earnings and market watch says buy! Buy!  But Warren buffet sold his entire position and JP just issued 13 bil in bonds… okay. It took like a fucking year for LB to hemorrhage and die. They just kept fudging numbers and the stock was at an all time high before it crashed. What else is at an all time high right now? The spy and literally everything? Yeah I’ll stick with my negative beta stock.</p>
<p><strong>Bubbles.</strong></p>
<p>Did anyone watch the doc on WeWork? It was great at first, idea was awesome, but they became a real estate company. The CEO was buying real estate and renting it to WeWork. He leverged the employees desire to be part of a community to get their labor at a reduced price. Gave them stock and crashed the company. Bottom line? He used fake numbers, said he had more customers than he did.</p>
<p>Another doc, Fake Famous, they get some instagramers up to 100k followers w just bots, and then they start getting free stuff and offers from advertisers and their legit making money by posting to fucking bots. And the companies pay for it. And you know insta loves it, looks like they have so many users but shit its mostly bots.  i wonder if other social medias are similar??  fake users, fake earnings.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Real estate and fake clients.</strong></p>
<p>-Big funds make little funds, “clients” or cubs (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mewopn/anne_dias_griffin_the_silent_tiger_cub_of_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mewopn/anne_dias_griffin_the_silent_tiger_cub_of_the/</a>)</p>
<p>-They use real estate sales to transfer money without paying normal taxes, and use the real estate as leverage for more margin.</p>
<p>-NJ Deli doing 35k in annual sales valued at 100 mil in the stock market (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/theres-a-single-new-jersey-deli-doing-35000-in-sales-valued-at-100-million-in-the-stock-market.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/15/theres-a-single-new-jersey-deli-doing-35000-in-sales-valued-at-100-million-in-the-stock-market.html</a>)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think they are using real estate with the repo market to raise liquidity. But its not real liquidity. If I’m citadel and I need more assets on my books so I can get more margin, I go to the bank and get a loan for a 10+ million dollar property (ringing bells? Jordan Belforts interview with Trey 15:30 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIfL42bgijA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIfL42bgijA</a> ) I put 2 mil down, and pay like 20k a month. Fucking pennies. And you know Im not buying <em>one</em> 10 mil dollar property… Then I take that 10 mil asset to Palafox, my own repo service lol, leverage it for quick cash and bam- for 2 mil and 20 k monthly, I have a 10 mil asset and house to use or rent out, and 10 mil cash. If you buy the property cash, lets say 8 mil cause you got buddies in real estate! So they give me a lower rate and I give them cash on the side, win win. But its appraised at 10 mil. Now you have 10 mil in assets on your books that you can leverage, and it only cost you 8! 2 mil out of thin air. Imagine you do that a thousand times.  What happens to the price of real estate?? It goes uuuuuppp. What happens to your investment?? It goes UP. Cause supply and demand, and the higher the prices go the lower supply of affordable housing goes, the higher the demand, and the more they make again. Only problem is its all in appraisals, kind of like the junk bonds. But why would anyone stop it? They’re all getting paid, kind of like the big short.</p>

<p>Did anyone else think it was odd that ken had like all the highest priced properties in all the major areas? (Ny, London, Miami, Chicago, etc.) it makes sense if you have your own repo company and you can just turn it back into cash! I can buy the first property with cash and own it outright, then repo and buy another, which I also own outright. Then repo and buy another. It only ends when someone catches you. Shit if I could buy up all the best properties for the price of one id fucking do it to. I’d bet they can even leverage the leveraged properties. I think the house of cards that applies to the repos, applies to the real estate. Not only that, it’s over valued and I think that’s intentional, to raise capital. I think the same way they can buy stock back and forth to manipulate the price, its even easier to sell real estate back and forth and manipulate the price. Especially in Texas! No disclosure required on real estate sales. Look at whats going on in Austin:</p>

<p>just one example, happens to be on Congress and 6th for anyone following that cryptic post…the building has quite an interesting history, and ties to UT, who knew!</p>
<p>“George Littlefield was a major player in the Austin area. During the first 50 years of the University of Texas, he was the college’s biggest financial contributor.”</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Basically funds are buying up commercial real estate, and there are plenty of deals that don’t make a lot of sense, like the Littlefield Building which together with the Scarborough sold for 20 mil more than they were reasonably worth...</p>
<p>This going on all over the country, but especially in cities, and especially in TX</p>

<p>annnnnnnnd its gone.</p>
<p>This article is nuts:</p>
<p>"The pandemic has upended America’s commercial property sector. In cities across the country, skyscrapers are dark, shopping centers are shuttered and restaurants have been relegated to takeout service. Social-distancing measures have redefined workplaces and accelerated the trend of telecommuting. The $16 trillion commercial property sector is being stressed in ways not seen since the Great Recession of 2008.</p>
<p>According to Moody’s, the credit rating firm, commercial real estate values are projected to decline by 7.2% nationally from their pre-pandemic levels, bottoming out by the end of this year. The hardest hit categories are the office and retail sectors, with values declining by 12.6% for offices and 16.5% for retail."</p>
<p>These firms don’t just buy up houses for themselves, and shitty apartments to rent to us. They buy office buildings and malls and rent them out too.  and im pretty sure those assets aren't just sitting there, they're all leveraged.  if not once than twice.  and you would need a bank to help with all this (hey JP!) or you would need to pull a Hwang and trick a bunch of banks into leveraging the same asset.</p>
<p>please tell me how our economy is at an all time high? This shit is gonna blow.</p>

<p><strong>This is purely speculation and my own opinion.  Follow the links and make your own decisions.</strong></p>
<p>I can’t type anymore, lmk if I made any mistakes. A lot of other users helped me get here so shout out to all of you, i tried to link all the threads. obviously i read the everything short etc. but not tagging it because im sure you all know atobitt and his work.  To the moon apes!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I don’t fully understand this so im just gonna leave it here in case someone else does:</p>

<p>but I think its just saying Palafox sponsored itself, Citadel Global Fixed Income Master Fund, so they could clear cash and repo trades faster.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thetradenews.com/jp-morgan-clears-first-repo-new-dtcc-sponsor-programme/">In April, JP Morgan became the first member</a> under the DTCC’s fixed income sponsor member programme to clear a repo transaction.</p>
<p>Its just weird to me that these two end up in another article together but seemingly unrelated, idk I need another ape to elaborate on this one, I’m beat.</p>
