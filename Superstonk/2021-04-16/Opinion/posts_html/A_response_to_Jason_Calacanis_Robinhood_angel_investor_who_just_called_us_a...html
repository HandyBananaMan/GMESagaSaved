<p>Dear Jason Calacanis,</p>
<p>I just witnessed you giving unsolicited advice to retail investors in their 20s and 30s to not put 99% of their savings into the market and play it safe. You ask them to first buy a home, and save enough to pay for their kids college funds.</p>
<p>Last I checked we do not live in the 1950s where you could a house with 2 years or so of your salary. You're asking people in their 20s and 30s to wait until they're in their 40s and 50s to buy their first home and <em>then</em> yolo whatever is left of their savings when they are boomer age.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing. Did it occur to you that almost all of your profit from Robinhood comes from this "cult" yoloing their life savings into it. Fortunately, the cult will be migrating from your platform soon.</p>
<p>Respectfully go fuck yourself,</p>
<p>The cult of apes</p>
<p>PS. Never understood why CNBC is obsessed with educating us the cult, after all we are the losers according to them, what do they have to lose?</p>
