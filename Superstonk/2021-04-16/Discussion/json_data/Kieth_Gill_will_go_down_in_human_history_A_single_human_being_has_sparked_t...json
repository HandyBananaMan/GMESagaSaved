    "selftext": "I don\u2019t want to post a mega wall of text. But it is truly a blessing to live through such a historic event and witness a single human make such a massive difference across the world. His stake in GameStop piqued the interest of millions to invest into the stock market. This then led to the reveal of how Wall Street has been rigging the game against the world to amass an incredible amount of wealth that was beyond our comprehension. \n\n~~His crusade against the hedgies who were so over leveraged drew an army of apes that have revealed just how corrupt the entire system is.~~ This has now led us to find that the U.S economy is being shorted by those who invest within it. And sparked reform after reform. He did nothing outright to convince us to invest in it, other than him showing how committed he was to the stock. \n\n3 months ago when I bought into GME. I wouldn\u2019t of believed you if you told me that my small gamble to get me and my wife out of debt would of led to a massive movement. These last 3 months have been an absolute blast, and I want to thank every single one of you diamond handed fucking apes for hodling. This has been an absolute honor, to the moon!\n\n*Edit* My bad y\u2019all, I didn\u2019t proof read enough and misspelled his name. Keith Gill, the man, the myth, the legend.\n\n*Edit 2* A lot of you felt as the crusade part was a bit much and I agree, after reading my post and the responses, this is not a crusade. This entire fiasco is simply us realizing how absolutely corrupt Wall St is. It made us all come together to stand up against the fuckery, to create a better, fair, and true free market.",
