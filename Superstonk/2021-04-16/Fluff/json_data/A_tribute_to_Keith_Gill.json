    "selftext": "*none of Keith Gill\u2019s actions or statements contributed to my financial decisions, because I make my own decisions and am an independent trader. \n\nRegardless of what happens here, this is feeling like an end of an era and I can\u2019t help but feel emotional. Keith Gill, DFV, Roaring Kitty - whatever you want to call him, is such an inspiration. \n\nSomeone so smart, so kind, so personable. Seriously, from the last few months I feel so inspired to do my research, find my conviction and stick with it. I learned to never respond to haters or naysayers with anything other than kindness. I learned that I too am DESERVING of abundance. \n\nKeith Gill, if you ever see this, I vow to carry on the values you unintentionally encourage by just being yourself. You are a legend and I hope you and your family stay blessed, happy and safe. \n\nTo a real life legend \ud83e\udd42 your story is one I\u2019ll tell for a lifetime.",
