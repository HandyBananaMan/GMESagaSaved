<p>*none of Keith Gillâ€™s actions or statements contributed to my financial decisions, because I make my own decisions and am an independent trader. </p>
<p>Regardless of what happens here, this is feeling like an end of an era and I canâ€™t help but feel emotional. Keith Gill, DFV, Roaring Kitty - whatever you want to call him, is such an inspiration. </p>
<p>Someone so smart, so kind, so personable. Seriously, from the last few months I feel so inspired to do my research, find my conviction and stick with it. I learned to never respond to haters or naysayers with anything other than kindness. I learned that I too am DESERVING of abundance. </p>
<p>Keith Gill, if you ever see this, I vow to carry on the values you unintentionally encourage by just being yourself. You are a legend and I hope you and your family stay blessed, happy and safe. </p>
<p>To a real life legend ðŸ¥‚ your story is one Iâ€™ll tell for a lifetime.</p>
