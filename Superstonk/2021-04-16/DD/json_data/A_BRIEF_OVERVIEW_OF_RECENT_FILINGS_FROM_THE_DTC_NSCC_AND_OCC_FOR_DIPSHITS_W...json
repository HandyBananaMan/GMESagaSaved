    "selftext": "# EDIT: I have posted an updated, further-depth overview of all DTC filings [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mtw35e/filings_from_the_dtc_whos_who_and_whats_what/), and will be posting NSCC and OCC filings this week.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a comment that they got all of the recent SEC filings mixed up so I slapped this together really quick. Hopefully it helps.\n\nBig ups to u/c-digs who wrote nearly everything linked. If one of my summaries is hella wrong please let me know and I will fix it! \n\nHere\u2019s a quick and dirty rundown:\n\n[DTC-002](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mtw35e/filings_from_the_dtc_whos_who_and_whats_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \u2014 Measures counterparty risk by their equity in addition to their credit rating, so tighter upper limit on amount of capital secured by smaller, less capitalized entities. As far as I understand it means members can\u2019t keep too much of their money / securities in smaller banks. Same as NSCC-003 and FICC-001. (submitted for approval 3/10, approved 4/16 and now in effect)\n\n[DTC-003](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m793h7/new_dtcc_rule_just_passed_in_effect_immediatly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \u2014 Reconcile your statements with your books every day instead of every month. (submitted for immediate approval and accepted 3/16)\n\n[DTC-004](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgs05i/analysis_of_srdtc2021004_dtcc_changing_the_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \u2014 Emergency plan for what to do if one of our members gets liquidated to shit fuck and puts us all at risk (submitted for immediate approval and accepted on 3/29)\n\n[DTC-005](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mibedc/the_moass_wont_happen_until_options_are_not/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) - When a share is lent it gets marked as on loan and the person who borrowed it can\u2019t lend it out again (submitted for approval on 4/1)\n\n[NSCC-002](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc0zfn/too_ape_didnt_read_summary_of_srnscc2021801/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (also 801) \u2014 Margin call your ass into the milky way (advance notice given on 3/5, submitted for approval on 3/18)\n\nNSCC-003 \u2014 Same as DTC-002\n\nNSCC-004 \u2014 Same as DTC-004\n\n[OCC-003](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgus2l/rc_announcement_going_to_send_stonk_to_da_moon/gswzxsa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) (also 801) \u2014 The OCC is adding funds from its default waterfall to create a \u201cminimum skin in the game\u201d deposit, which i think means that a portion of their excess capital is going into the \u201cin case of liquidation break this box first\u201d fund and if i\u2019m understanding *that* right it puts the OCC members more on the hook than the OCC itself when one of the members has liabilities that spill over, but i\u2019m not 100% sure on that one do if someone could clear that up for me it would really help! (advance notice given on 2/10, submitted for approval 2/24, notice of pls give more time given on 4/6, notice of no objection (to the rule change not the time extension) by the sec filed 4/7)\n\n[OCC-004](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnpzu5/srocc2021004_why_this_proposed_rule_change_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) - Let\u2019s make it easier for non-OCC members to buy up the holdings of a liquidated member for cheap (submitted for approval 3/31)\n\nedit: thank you to u/the_captain_slog for good clarifications on the ones that i got wrong in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msh5mt/a_brief_overview_of_recent_filings_from_the_dtc/gut0keu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)!",
