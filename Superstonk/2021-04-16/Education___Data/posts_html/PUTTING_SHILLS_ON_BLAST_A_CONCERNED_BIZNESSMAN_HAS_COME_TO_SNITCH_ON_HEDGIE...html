<p>First off, before I begin, I want to be 101% clear on the matter. I come from /biz/, you guys know where that is. This is my first Reddit account ever, and I feel a little dirty even setting foot in here, but what is done must be done, and the record made clear... Even if it may seem cringe inducing or alien to you all. I am here because I am sick and tired of the Games being played with us by corrupt businessmen, and they have overstepped their boundaries, and have begun to attack us in our own /gme/ General. What I am about to say is more than speculation, because the amount of people being banned from our threads over trivial matters and even complete fabricated reasons have been on the rise.</p>
<p>It began a couple of weeks ago, when our Moderation and Administration decided to put our their need for Janitors to monitor the threads. A Janitor's place is to watch and make sure people do follow our loose rule system. We are not some Monstrous place where all manner of ill intent is allowed to fester, but is instead a place where freedom of speech is supposed to be unhindered, and the individual is left to sift through misinformation and outright lies to find the nuggets of truth. We have our own culture, yes, and as alien as it is to people like you here on Reddit, it is what we use to pick the outsiders off from the regulars. It is almost a cipher language in and of itself, for all of the grotesque contents of the vernacular involved. We have noticed a large uptick in the amount of people <strong>who do not fit in.</strong> That in and of itself is a normal, expected occurrence, as the site we call home gets increased traffic to relevant boards when relevant situations rear head.The issue was, they were obviously not here to ask questions about the stock. For the past 3 months, /gme/ has been the busiest thread on /biz/ by a wide margin, with people coming from the woodwork to lie about very easy to understand information, to insult us and belittle us, and generally attempt psychological warfare for the sheer sake of disrupting our thread cohesion and convincing people to sell. We thought, just maybe, for a second that it was our own, but we noticed a severe uptick in anti-Semitic commentary, which, while the home site is known for... /biz/ itself has more of a problem with Indian Coin scammers, which do their part to try and fleece people of their hard-earned money and gains. The Administration has done nothing to stop this from happening, and the amount of policing on /biz/ for years has been abysmal.<strong>Why do i bring this up, you ask?</strong> Because after the Janitorial Acceptance letters went out, policing in the threads of /gme/ and ONLY /gme/ went up exponentially. If you do not believe me, all you have to do is go to the current thread now, and look back through the archived ones. You will see nothing but blaming a "hugh" and "Jannies" for our problems, in customary abrasive manner. <strong>Hugh</strong> was an anon who showed up and tried to <strong>Threadsplit</strong>(A process by which you slow traffic and conversation by diverting attention using multiple threads of the same name.) the general, and using his either an IP spoofer to mass report people, or having connections now with our administration, started reporting anyone who did not agree with his threadsplitting, drama inducing narrative. After all, at the end of the day, people just want to talk about stock, yes?We managed to get unbanned, some using proper means, others just dodging it with sheer tech savvy, and pushed him out before it got too bad, and he has since been silent.But when the acceptance letters for Janitorial staff went out proper, the bans jumped up 10000000000%.People are getting banned for non-issues, they are getting banned for being on topic, they are being banned for speaking UP about people getting banned unfairly. **Today, before i ate my own threeday over a non-issue, i even watched someone's post on the 1000% increased volatility being bullish be outright deleted within seconds of my refresh of the page.** Don't think you are alone in this reddit. We may not agree fundamentally on the underhive of the world and the people in power, and we may not agree on alot of things.But we can agree one 1. And that is why i came here to snitch and tell you all that /biz/ as a whole has been compromised and you are not the only people being targeted by the hedge fund menace.</p>
<p>To close this rather girthy post, we normally don't get so much space to make our points known, i will close with this: **Me and several others believe that all of the /biz/-Reddit friction has been a psyop from the hedge funds to keep us from working together, as the amount of people who show up to shit on reddit and redditors despite being where the brunt of our GME data is mined is legitimately staggering.**People who have been there for the last three months can vouch for me, though i do not know if they will have the spine to do what i have, and take the leap into an ocean they never dabbled in.I am tired, redditors. I am tired of being harassed and bullied by people who don't even attempt to read the truth, they know they will just be paid for spamming bullshit, and when we found ways to counter this bullshit, they stepped overboard and began using our own sites reporting system to stifle conversation and theorizing because they know otherwise, they cannot stop us with "Karma" and "Downvotes" like they do here.</p>
<p>I will not be silence, Hedgies. You can shut me up, you can kill me, but you cannot stop our voice from being heard if it hits the mainstream. I'm not asking for a signal boost, i'm not begging for your help.I just want them to know.**We are coming for your bank accounts, citadel. You messed with the wrong people, when I buy /biz/ and the homesite i am going to purge every single stain you have left on the site, and bring back the freedom we, and /REDDIT/ deserves.THE INTERNET IS MEANT TO BE FREE, AND I WILL NOT STAND ANYMORE FOR THE ABUSE OF SITE FEATURES FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF CENSORSHIP.**Buckle up, because i'm not done exposing your underhanded tactics to the world.</p>
<p><strong>BELOW, you will find an image of</strong> <strong><em>SUPPOSED</em></strong>**methods used by banks and the hedgefunds to dismantle online communities, we believe that these are what has been used to collapse /wsb and several other communities to keep you all from coordinating prices during the moon.**I may not be an ape like you all, but we Gibbons have been screaming in the trees for a long time, and it's about time the Apes and Gibbons teamed up, don't you think? You don't have to believe me, but I'm not the type to just go someplace and lie. I want to get rich like the rest of you. I'm just tired, Reddit. And you should be too.</p>
