Thanks to u/Horror_Veterinar for pointing out the YouTube video that shows many State pension/retirement funds are long GME in this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oqvnna/28\_of\_the\_us\_is\_long\_on\_gme\_gmerica/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oqvnna/28_of_the_us_is_long_on_gme_gmerica/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I'm not a trusting person, so I double checked Bloomberg. There are actually 14 states that are long GME, including Texas!

The Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of America (TIAA-CREF) also owns a fuk ton and may represent schools from many other states.

11 of the state filings are from 3/31/21 and 8 are from 6/30/21. TIAA-Cref filing is from 7/22/21.

**THAT'S 28% OF AMERICA. GMERICA!!**

**Edit 2:** New York is in there twice (2 diff funds), so changed 15 states to 14 states and 29% to 28%, except in the title. FYI, TIAA likely covers a couple dozen more states as they are used nation wide for teachers, so 28% is a low figure. GMERICA!

**Edit 3:** Not sure if I'm getting shilled below, but these state funds are NOT included in BlackRock. Here are all of BlackRock ETFs and 13f's with GME holdings.

**TL;DR 28% of America Long GME. GMERICA!**
