The NSCC is fully aware of the risks involved with re-hypothecating collateral, or re-pledging collateral, and have designed this service to prevent that from occurring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real TL;DR? One sentence, directly from the filing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/fhv2ur8hl9d71.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef1b2c989b4455805e631f7826f9663cf4d69c53](https://preview.redd.it/fhv2ur8hl9d71.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef1b2c989b4455805e631f7826f9663cf4d69c53)\n\nKeep in mind, this likely won't see approval for sometime.\n\nHopefully it gets enacted before MOASS, as this really leads me to believe that if it isn't, MOASS truly will destroy this market, in my dumbass opinion of course. We'll see!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUntil then, I hodl.\n\nI just sobered up.. I'm scared to scroll up.\n\nCya on the next update!",
