<p>What's up, individual investors!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Man, the MOAFF just hit the DTCC website.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is the most complex, in depth filing I've ever came across, and it will likely take me weeks to interpret this due to the significant amount of PROPOSALS included in this 369 (giggity) pages long rule filing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On TOP of that, the DTC-2021-014 filing goes hand in hand with this one, and many references found in DTC-2021-014 lead you straight back to NSCC-2021-803 (the Advanced Notice) and/or NSCC-2021-010, the Proposed Rule. That being said, it wouldn't be appropriate to try and decipher 014 until we can first comprehend the legacy filing of which is the MOAFF, The Mother of All Fucking Filings, which NSCC-2021-803, the topic of discussion in this post.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>(B) Proposed Rule 2D – Agent Clearing Members</strong></p>
<p><strong>(C) Proposed Rule 56 – Securities Financing Transaction Clearing Service</strong></p>
<p><strong>(D) Other Rule Changes</strong></p>
<p>" In connection with proposed Rules 2C, 2D and 56, NSCC is also proposing to make conforming and technical changes to the following Rules to accommodate the proposed introduction of the new membership categories and the proposed SFT Clearing Service. "</p>

<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Basically, the SFT service is a vehicle from separating shit from non shit.</p>
<p>They also specifically talk about MITIGATING RISK, and MITIGATING LIQUIDITY DRAIN:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Basically, they are fully aware that fire sale risk comes primarily from the rehypothecation of securities, which is why pledged collateral CANNOT be re-pledged.

<p>Remember, this is long, just like us.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If these mofos get caught with the "hot potato", or the "fuckloads of shit collateral", NSCC can liquidate their gross positions. (thanks 002). See how it all is coming together?</p>
<p>LIQUIDIY DRAIN:(sounds like a Warlock DOT)</p>

<p>They're basically aware that once someone get's caught with dogshit, they'll be forced to sell off their primary positions, or a "fire sale", and are designing this service to specifically mitigate the risks involved with mass selling off of positions to <strong><em>come up with the cash to meet their obligations, whatever the fuck that may be. ;)</em></strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's all I've got so far.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>This filing is bigger than my wife's boyfriend's D*ck.</p>
<p>I'll provide continuous updates as I move through this.</p>
<p>Community help is welcomed and appreciated.</p>
<p>Basically, they're creating a service for securities lending, where the NSCC is assuming all risk, therefore making significant regulatory, capital, and other requirements in order to <strong>receive the netting benefits</strong> that come with the service. The NSCC is fully aware of the risks involved with re-hypothecating collateral, or re-pledging collateral, and have designed this service to prevent that from occurring.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The real TL;DR? One sentence, directly from the filing:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="https://preview.redd.it/fhv2ur8hl9d71.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef1b2c989b4455805e631f7826f9663cf4d69c53" src="https://preview.redd.it/fhv2ur8hl9d71.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef1b2c989b4455805e631f7826f9663cf4d69c53" /></p>
<p>Keep in mind, this likely won't see approval for sometime.</p>
<p>Hopefully it gets enacted before MOASS, as this really leads me to believe that if it isn't, MOASS truly will destroy this market, in my dumbass opinion of course. We'll see!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Until then, I hodl.</p>
<p>I just sobered up.. I'm scared to scroll up.</p>
<p>Cya on the next update!</p>
