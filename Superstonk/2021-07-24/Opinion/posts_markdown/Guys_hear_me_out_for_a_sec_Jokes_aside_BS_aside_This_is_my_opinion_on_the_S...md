# Title: Guys hear me out for a sec. Jokes aside BS aside. This is my opinion on the SEC and Gary Gensler. I truly believe Gary is doing something and everyone has to be patient and wait because this is a case that has to be taken slowly.

Hear me for a sec before I get downvoted to oblivion. 

This is my opinion on this whole situation about SEC taking 90 years to do something is that Gary and RC is up to something and like RC said let our action speak than words. And there’s legal reasons that they are not allowed to say nothing. Before they take action. Everyone on here saying and talking shit that SEC taking forever such and such. But for a case like this is serious and all the manipulation that’s going on and darkpools and naked shorting that’s happening. I believe in Gary. And RC. And mr Sikh himself. But for a case like this this has to be taken seriously and in a timely manner and Gary has to make sure everything is right and proof of evidence. Cases like these has to be taken slowly and can’t rush. This is a VERY BIG case. I believe we are very fucking close like close and trust me I believe that the SEC sees that manipulation and that low ass volume yesterday. They got this guys. There’s a lot of you that very impatient and bashing the SEC and when they slay they skulls with the rulings it’s GG. Rulings are there there’s steps to this. Can you walk before you craw??? They have the watches we have the time. 

IT DONT COST US NOTHING!!!!
