    "selftext": "Hear me for a sec before I get downvoted to oblivion. \n\nThis is my opinion on this whole situation about SEC taking 90 years to do something is that Gary and RC is up to something and like RC said let our action speak than words. And there\u2019s legal reasons that they are not allowed to say nothing. Before they take action. Everyone on here saying and talking shit that SEC taking forever such and such. But for a case like this is serious and all the manipulation that\u2019s going on and darkpools and naked shorting that\u2019s happening. I believe in Gary. And RC. And mr Sikh himself. But for a case like this this has to be taken seriously and in a timely manner and Gary has to make sure everything is right and proof of evidence. Cases like these has to be taken slowly and can\u2019t rush. This is a VERY BIG case. I believe we are very fucking close like close and trust me I believe that the SEC sees that manipulation and that low ass volume yesterday. They got this guys. There\u2019s a lot of you that very impatient and bashing the SEC and when they slay they skulls with the rulings it\u2019s GG. Rulings are there there\u2019s steps to this. Can you walk before you craw??? They have the watches we have the time. \n\nIT DONT COST US NOTHING!!!!\n\nI know everyone wants the tendons and can\u2019t wait to live life but the patient gets rewarded. To the one that wants to quit jobs and such. DO NOT QUIT YOUR JOBS. we still have work and this is not over till I see millies in my bank. Try your best to stay with your jobs. Don\u2019t quit yet. Please\n\nAnd everyone chill relax and buy and hodl. Not a financial advisor!\n\nGuys go outside and enjoy life enjoy the weekend. Get off Reddit. Go do something with your family. Enjoy the sun.",
