Well, well, well, some stuff has happened and we’ve been busy plugging holes, changing things up, and planning for the future.

# General Updates

1. With the other top mods gone, [u/Bye\_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/), [u/Bradduck\_Flyntmoore](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore/), [u/Captain-Fan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Captain-Fan/) and I will be the top-level “admin” mods.
2. To reflect this change the mod list will be rearranged in the near future, so if you see mods randomly get yeeted off the mod list, it’s just getting rearranged.
3. New mods! We are severely understaffed, like fuck me. We got mod work coming out of the wazoo - stay tuned for some new mod updates in the future, as we’re bringing on some wrinkles and active community members to plug the holes!

Lastly, you’d have noticed there have been some fuck ups with automod among other things the past week… Bear (hah) with us, we are currently doing some changes to Automod and in a subreddit of this size, that sometimes means fuckups. When we have more mods on board, you can expect everything to become more stable (my weekends' are also expecting the same thing hah).

# Automod

This has been the bane of my and many other mods' existence for the past week. I’m sure you’ve noticed.

1. A certain two-letter abbreviation for Superstonk, we tried to implement it in automod to remove comments/posts with it, but we fucked up and it ended up resulting in MOATH and Mike Tyson memes (tbh a pretty funny outcome) - we’ve fixed it, so back to MOASS it is
2. Infinity Pool, nuff said.
3. All stock/GME related subs (except [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/)) are removed as per Reddit Admin’s brigading prevention code. We’re reaching out to Reddit admin to allow cross-posting between the other GME subs again, so fingers crossed that in the near future full-on cross-posting shall resume!
4. We also wanted to reiterate that attempting to circumvent automod is a major violation of the rules... Especially given the above.

# Awards Contest!

What’s that? Good question, it got lost in the recent drama. We held an award contest a month ago now - Don't worry, it’s still happening, your submissions were lit! We will still be holding the contest, we only ask for your patience while we get everything sorted out.

# Avoiding Mod Drama

I don't like mod drama in the sub, you don't, no one does. As such, we’re developing internal policies that are line by line in terms of action. It'll address various situations so that it does not make its way into the sub.

Onwards and upwards everyone!
