<p>Hey Apes, wanted to give a quick update as I'm getting pings from people asking about part 3.  </p>
<p>It will be the most ambitious work I've done yet, and ties a lot together.  </p>
<p><strong>OH AND IT'S JUICY</strong></p>
<p>Aiming to have it out before Friday, but might need to push it into the weekend (i.e. first weekend in August).  </p>
<p>Stay tuned...</p>
