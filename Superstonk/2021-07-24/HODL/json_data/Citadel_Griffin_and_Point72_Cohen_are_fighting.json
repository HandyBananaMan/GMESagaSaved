    "selftext": "I think griffin and point72 Cohen are publicly \u00e9lit fighting each other in the open and no one is noticing\n\nI strongly believe that point72 Cohen wants to throw Kenny under since he\u2019s the one and only face we constantly blame for our beloved stock.\n\nI suspect the elite agreed on throwing citadel and Melvin under the buss in the upcoming boner. However, Kenny doesn\u2019t go down without a fight. lately we\u2019ve been seeing a lot of memes of point72 Cohen circulating around in superstonk and numerous dd trying to wake the interest of the public in point72 involvement (since they were lowkey hiding in the storm)\n\nFurthermore we notice an uptick of Twitter trending #darkpoolsabuse which is another citadel push against point72.\n\nThen LinkedIn public posts against citadel rise.\n\nAnd all of sudden we have someone talking to Charles pain the day after how (citadel is abusing the dark pool) and not getting enough fines.\n\nI strongly believe that HF are canabalizing against each other publicly (rich man style) at the moment\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to proof here, just a hunch but a bloody string one. We might see citadel die in the upcoming weeks and claim the squeeze is over.\n\nBut it won\u2019t be.\n\nSomeone push left, someone else pushes right. They\u2019re fighting publicly and they want to throw each other under the buss & I\u2019m loving it.",
