I think griffin and point72 Cohen are publicly élit fighting each other in the open and no one is noticing

I strongly believe that point72 Cohen wants to throw Kenny under since he’s the one and only face we constantly blame for our beloved stock.

I suspect the elite agreed on throwing citadel and Melvin under the buss in the upcoming boner. However, Kenny doesn’t go down without a fight. lately we’ve been seeing a lot of memes of point72 Cohen circulating around in superstonk and numerous dd trying to wake the interest of the public in point72 involvement (since they were lowkey hiding in the storm)

Furthermore we notice an uptick of Twitter trending #darkpoolsabuse which is another citadel push against point72.

Then LinkedIn public posts against citadel rise.

And all of sudden we have someone talking to Charles pain the day after how (citadel is abusing the dark pool) and not getting enough fines.

I strongly believe that HF are canabalizing against each other publicly (rich man style) at the moment

There’s nothing to proof here, just a hunch but a bloody string one. We might see citadel die in the upcoming weeks and claim the squeeze is over.

But it won’t be.

Someone push left, someone else pushes right. They’re fighting publicly and they want to throw each other under the buss & I’m loving it.
