Hey Apes, wanted to give a quick update as I'm getting pings from people asking about part 3.  
  
It will be the most ambitious work I've done yet, and ties a lot together.  
  
**OH AND IT'S JUICY**

Aiming to have it out before Friday, but might need to push it into the weekend (i.e. first weekend in August).  
  
Stay tuned...
