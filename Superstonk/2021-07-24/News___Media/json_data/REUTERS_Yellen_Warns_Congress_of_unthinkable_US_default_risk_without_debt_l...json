It\u2019s possible that we could reach that  point while Congress is out in August, and I would really urge prompt  action on raising the limit or suspending it,\u201d Yellen said.**\n\nAccording  to Senate and House of Representatives legislative calendars, the  August recess will run from Aug. 9 to Sept. 10 in the Senate [here](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/2021_schedule.htm) and July 30 to Sept. 19 in the House [here](https://www.majorityleader.gov/sites/democraticwhip.house.gov/files/2021CALENDAR-REVISED2.pdf), with committee work scheduled on several days in early September.\n\nIf  the debt limit prevents Treasury from new borrowing, the government  would have to rely only tax receipts to pay obligations, eventually  making it impossible to make some debt repayments.\n\n(article Continues)\n\n=================================================================================\n\nWhat's going to happen? Looks like the most likely option is that Congress will hike the debt ceiling soon- but this will only push us further down the road of endless government borrowing. If they don't, the federal government will be unable to fund thousands of government programs, facing another nationwide federal shutdown similar to 2013.",
