<p>I was reading a DD while drunk at a bar (don’t ask me for a link, I said I’m drunk). But it said “if apes hold” and I practically rolled my eyes. </p>
<p>Apes aren’t selling. I know that so much so that it’s a given, I don’t even have to consider the alternative. We buy, we hodl, we wait for ignition. </p>
<p>There are so many infinity apes that I don’t ever have to worry about a ceiling, those badass’s own the float themselves. </p>
<p>I took way longer typing this out because of all of the types my phone pointed out that I can’t type right now. Fuck it, upvote me. You won’t.</p>
<p>Edit 1 (1:34 am EST): If this gets more than 35 upvotes, imma be mad as fuck. I’ll tell you why If applicable.</p>
<p>Edit 2 (2:02 am EST): Fuck all yinz (Pittsburghese represent). This drunken word vomit got more love than the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oglr4z/hopefully_well_be_able_to_preorder_this_next_week/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Destroy All Humans</a> meme that I edited and spent hours on lol. Lick my zero G sack in space after the MOASS. </p>
<p>JK, I love you all.</p>
