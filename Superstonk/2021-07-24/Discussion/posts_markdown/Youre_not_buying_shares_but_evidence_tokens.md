What if I told you come Monday you couldn't buy anymore shares of GME? The reality is... you most likely can't. The available float of 56.41 million shares has all been bought. The DDs on this have pretty much confirmed it. So then what exactly are any of us buying then? I like to think of it as evidence tokens. It is physical evidence that naked short selling exists.

Like many have pointed out the price is fake. I would even say the volume is fake to a big degree. The longer SHFs play this game the more dangerous it becomes for them. Synthetic shares are being used to drive the price down. But everyday this means apes can collect these synthetic shares so SHFs have to come up with more and more synthetic shares. By hodling more and more shares that do not exist in the float they now become evidence tokens that the game is rigged at the highest levels. It also adds exponentially to potential losses as well. Imagine if each day apes and retail bought 50,000 - 100,000 shares and added it to the permanent hodl pool. Over the course of weeks and months this would be millions of more debt obligations with no ceiling. Hodling is the one thing that is real. It will force their hand and the longer this drags on the more evidence tokens we collect. Time is on our side. It's allowed me to keep buying and finding more money to put in. I watch the time and sales details. There are so many single stock purchases. I think of apes and diamond hands everytime I see one. The company is being bought up share by share, brick by brick.

How is this all going to play out? Simple, I don't know and neither does anyone else. We are living through history and I want to make sure my shares are stashed away for all of it. The rest is FUD or me trying to convince myself I can somehow time this all, I can't. The value of the shares is in the possession of them.

I think that is the biggest problem here. If they can take our shares from us then this is not a market. As a US stock holder you can hold onto your stocks forever if you like. You can sell them tomorrow. You can lend them out. You are free to do whatever you want. But during the enfolding of all of this if they take our shares, make us sell or try and price control a share of a public company with earnings, they will in turn destroy the trust and legitimacy of the US stock market. Hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars are on the table depending on how this plays out.

The answer is hodl. Always has been.

Not financial advice.
