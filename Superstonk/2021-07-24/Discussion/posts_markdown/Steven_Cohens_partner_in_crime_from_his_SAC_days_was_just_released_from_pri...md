First things first. Brain smooth. I'm just an ape that is somehow capable of using the internet from a phone. The perfect personification of a retail investor. So I was doing some research on boy wonder Steven A. Cohen from his SAC days. I didn't realized it was based off his initials. What a vain SAC of crap. Anyways, Stevie didn't go to prison because he paid a hefty fine of 1.8 billion for insider trading. Meanwhile his partner in crime [Mathew Martoma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Martoma), was sentenced to 9 years. He was just released July 19th, 2021. This last Monday. I couldn't find anything confirming his release so I went to [FCI Miami inmate site](https://www.bop.gov/mobile/find_inmate/byname.jsp#inmate_results) to check for myself and it says he was released on the 19th. I'm not sure what to do with this information but the date being so recent was too much to ignore so I thought I would share.
