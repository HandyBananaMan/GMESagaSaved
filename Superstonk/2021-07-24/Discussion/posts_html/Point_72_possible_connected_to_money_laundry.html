<p>Can it be that Coin - Base, or the Coin - Base architecture is used to convert crypto for money laundering (washing money). </p>
<p>A less extreme example (possible) is money laundry for hedge funds and other financial institutions. </p>
<p>A medium extreme example (possible but not likely) is money laundering for drug trafficking and other illicit activities. </p>
<p>A pretty extreme example (Likely not possible, due to the groups utilizing other methods) is money laundering for ransonware attacks, such as attacks by the groups Maze, Conti, REvil and Netwalker. </p>
<p>As other users have mentioned before, there is a connection between crypto currency and the moment of certain stocks. It is possible that Point 72 could be aiding SHF, with the money from naked shorting and other financially illegal activities.</p>
