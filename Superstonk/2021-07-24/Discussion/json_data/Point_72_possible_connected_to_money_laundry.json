It is possible that Point 72 could be aiding SHF, with the money from naked shorting and other financially illegal activities.\n\n-----\u2010----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information:\n\nPoint72 has a substantial holding in the company Coin - desk. \n\nCathie Wood of Ark is one of the leading investors in Coin - Desk & Grayscale C ry p t o Trust \n\nARK's first four ETF funds were seeded with capital from Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional Reddit posts/sources handling similar subjects:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nfpyp5/btc_followed_wyckoffs_distribution_model_to_the_t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mu2l9y/hedge_funds_might_be_using_crypto_btc_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oqxkfn/someone_talk_about_steve_cohen_and_point_72s/",
