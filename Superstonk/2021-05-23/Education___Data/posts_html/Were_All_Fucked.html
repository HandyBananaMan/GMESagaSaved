<p>I have no background in macroeconomics. In fact, I'm in healthcare. However, this is what I've gathered in all of my 3 months of investing, learning more about econ and finance than my own field. You tell me what you think and where we stand. The title of my post... pretty much sums up my thoughts. If I made any mistakes, please let me know. After all, I'm a smooth üß†.</p>
<h1>1. S&amp;P 500 inflation-adjusted earnings yield üî•</h1>
<p>You may have seen this picture from this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/niem73/sp_500_inflationadjusted_earnings_yield_falls/">post</a>. It's the <strong>S&amp;P 500 inflation-adjusted earnings yield that's now falling below zero, setting a 40-year low</strong>. The last times it fell below 0 were in 2008 (housing bubble), 2000 (dotcom bubble), 1987 (Black Monday), 1973 (recession). And it's going under again. Here's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nil0ww/sp_500_negative_yield_crescat_capital_letter_may/">another post about it, with Crescat Capital's letter.</a> Essentially, impending boom ?</p>

<h1>2. The Repo Market üí£</h1>
<p>It's been all the talk lately. Lately, the Fed has been conducting reverse repo operations at higher and <strong>higher</strong> amounts. On May 20th, we hit the 5th highest ever with $351B and 48 participating counterparties.</p>
<p>Then on <strong>May 21st, reverse repos reached $369B with 52 participants!</strong> Compare this to two weeks ago where we had less than half that amount, $155B on May 6th. Here's a chart showing reverse repos from January til today. Notice the exponential increase ? Ya, shit is fucked.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/cf707nbxpb171.png?width=793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a804fd59f761970edd40cf1a76b2ca4e8fb5ac65</p>
<p>Data from: <a href="https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp">https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp</a></p>
<p>Edit: 05/25: reverse repo @ $432.96 billion.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the repo market, I recommend reading this: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhepn1/the_imminent_liquidity_crisis_reverse_repos_usage/">The Imminent Liquidity Crisis &amp; Reverse Repos Usage</a> or watching George Gammon's YouTube video (Repo Market Rates Turn Negative).</p>
<p>Wat mean? Means there is too much cash in the system and not enough collateral (like treasury bonds). It means there's an imbalance between dollars (which are essentially IOUs) and whatever is backing the dollar's worth.</p>
<p>Why imbalance ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantitative easing (money printer go BRRRR)</li>
<li>Rehypothecation (the same treasury bond being lent to A for 10k, who lent it to B for 10k, who lent it to C for 10k, ... but there is only 1 treasury bond and now 30k was lent.)</li>
<li>Probably more reasons</li>
</ul>
<p>So now, nobody wants $ (except you and I) and all of these institutions want treasury bonds. And as of May 21, <strong>treasury bonds have a negative interest rate!</strong> Source: <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/charts/dtcc-gcf-repo-index">https://www.dtcc.com/charts/dtcc-gcf-repo-index</a></p>

<p>In other words, banks and institutions want these treasury bonds so bad, they're ready to pay (lend) what it's worth and pay some more cash to get their hands on it.</p>

<h1>3. Crypto Correction / Crash ‚ö°</h1>
<p>The crypto market dropped $1 trillion in the past 2 weeks ($700 billion last week and \~$300 billion the week before if I got my facts right). The leading coin went from \~$59k to \~$30k and all other coins followed.</p>
<p>So there's a LOT of differing opinions on this matter, on why it happened... Elon Musk, China, etc. Let's agree that it was probably a combination of everything. It also seems that the leading coin followed a textbook Wyckoff distribution, essentially a method to fleece retail investors (yet again!).</p>

<p>What happened on May 19th ? Oh, right! OCC had previously issued a letter to members notifying them of temporary increase in deposits for clearing fund size totaling <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nftyg4/occ_has_issued_a_statement_to_all_clearing/">$588M due at 9:00 AM on 5/19/2021</a>. So, let's all agree the crash was caused by a combination of <strong>everything.</strong></p>

<li>Since January 2021 up until today, the SEC has awarded \~$163.2 million to whistleblowers. Whistleblowers get 10-30% of the money collected, which means someone is bleeding from $544 million to $1.632B.</li>

<h1>13. Final words üíé</h1>
<p>My goal is <strong>not</strong> to incite panic but to share data and encourage discussion. Without knowledge, where would we even begin, let alone be prepared ? Imo, this is what makes r/superstonk great. It's like a hive mind of 300k+ people sharing info.</p>
<p>To those who are panicking, I believe US banks insure up to $250k for each account. The comment section below is quite informative as well.</p>
<p>Are all the points in my post correlated ? Maybe, maybe not. Saying they are would be speculation. However, each point was based on facts and I think that's what matters. The rest is up for you to decide.</p>
<p>This is not financial advice. If I missed anything, please let me know.</p>
