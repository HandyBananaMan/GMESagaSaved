Hey all, I wanted to put out some information to help mitigate the kind of FUD and assumptions that are not helpful for our community. The amount of misinformation pertaining to the dip with crypto has created so many assumptions that the narrative gets twisted. My tin-foil hat theory is that this is being done intentionally. They think we are stupid. My intent is to clear up some of the assumptions of why crypto has moved the way it has and how it has nothing to do with GME.

&#x200B;

**Preface**

I am not a financial advisor nor crypto expert. I just like the data! üíö For the sake of keeping this post from becoming a book, I am going to focus on BTC only and explain why it's being pushed around and the factors that influence it.

&#x200B;

**The Big Assumption**

I've been reading many posts about the concern that crypto is being used to help cover margin calls or the possibility that hedge funds are using it to gain leverage. At first glance, visuals like the one below may seem like hedge funds are in trouble. As much as I'd like to have that be the case, we simply do not have this kind of financial data or inside intel. If someone has a daily source of this kind of info, I will concede on this entire post and eat a box of crayons.

Unfortunately, visuals like this assume that the ones being margin-called are retail investors like you and me. Again, if we had some source to provide accurate data, I would encourage you to share such information.

**So what's going on?**

**BTC Bear/Bull Market Trend:** To avoid a book, here is a very good explanation as to what's up with BTC. It is actually very healthy for BTC to have taken the extreme dip that it has taken. It was expected that BTC would deviate from its bull market run.

&#x200B;

>The current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the Stock Market, we can access the general direction of where a stock may go by looking at the options chain as a general indicator. The stock market uses what's called PCR to provide an indication.

&#x200B;

>**The Put-Call Ratio (PCR)**:¬†[PCR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putcallratio.asp)¬†is the standard indicator that has been used for a long time to gauge the market direction. This simple ratio is computed by dividing the number of traded¬†[put options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp)¬†by the number of traded¬†[call options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp). It is one of the most common ratios to assess the investor sentiment for a market or a stock.

&#x200B;

To provide some contrast, I wanted to first show you what is expected for GME this week. As we can see in the visual below, GME is looking pretty healthy this coming week.

**So what is this clarity to speak of?**

Now to the nitty-gritty of what's up with BTC. There are many sites but one in particular that I've found helpful provides an overview of the BTC Options Chain. Within, you will find the option chain for BTC, ETH, and BCH.

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin Options Chain:** You can determine the max pain just like you would with a stock options chain. Within the picture below, it shows that the max pain for May 24th is 32K.

**BTC Options Chain Resource:** The site for this data can be found here: [Bit.com Options : BTC](https://app.laevitas.ch/dashboard/btc/bit/options/chain)

&#x200B;

Only a few days later, the max pain potential for May 28th is 25K. This is an extreme drop and the BTC whales of the world are guiding this. If this were to become true, then GME will be doing great and BTC will continue to make downward trends.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** To give some perspective, BTC's market cap is currently at $611,409,690,509 and GME is $12,511,742,633. There are some big whales who influence the BTC market and it should not be assumed that any negative/positive price movement of BTC is a direct reflection or an indicator of GME's potential price action. We know the market is being grossly manipulated, but we also know we own the float. This gives us a substantial advantage and these dirty methods being used against us will reach a limit. With each day the DD's and Analysis are becoming more refined. Each day we are getting smarter and closer to the MOASS. All we have to do is HODL and if have enough in the tank, buy the dips as they come along.

**Updated 1:**  My DD was not intended to define a margin call nor define all aspects of Crypto. It was to provide some insight into other ways to interpret the crypto and the stock market and how they differ. This past week our community was laden with **false narratives** of hedges being margin-called and that crypto et al were being used to cover. Trust me, **I'd love for Mr. Mayo face to be margin-called into oblivion**, but the spread of baseless info is toxic. Having more knowledge of how the crypto market can be assessed is a **measure to mitigate FUD**. That was the intent. To help my fellow Ape. We wrinkled and smooth brains are in this together and every day we get smarter. We can tear apart DD's, but nothing in my analysis is misleading. There is no false narrative, it is me offering a **new kind of tool** to make us strong. **FUD will separate us, we are better than that! üíö**

**Update 2:** Ignore the crypto FUD.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** BTC does not dictate the price of GME, we own the float and we are in control of that. ü¶çüöÄüçå
