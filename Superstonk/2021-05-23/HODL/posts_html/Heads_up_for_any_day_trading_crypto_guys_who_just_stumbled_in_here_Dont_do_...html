<p>This is not the place for day trading.  You will get clobbered.  Nothing makes sense with the price.</p>
<p>I could see them planning to push you here just to tank the price and have you sell just to get out before you had a chance to read and learn and figure out what is going on here...  and no offence... but it might be what you guys are planning to do with your crypto and throw it at gme. (Which I think is smart but what do I know)    this isn't the place for that.   Look at all the good news about the company.  New leadership.  No debt.  Big move to e commerce.  The list is a mile long.     Squeeze no squeeze this is a great company that's about to do great things.   Just stay calm.  Read the dd.   And hodl.</p>
<p>Do your own research... make your own plans.  This is not financial advice.   I'm retarded  etc etc.</p>
