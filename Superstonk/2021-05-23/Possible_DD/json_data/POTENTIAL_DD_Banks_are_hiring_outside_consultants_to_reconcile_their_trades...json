BNP was also recently involved in a money laundering scheme in Gabon but since this specifically mentions derivatives experience I don't think it's related to that.\n\nCould this have anything to do with Robinhood's recent cost basis fuckery? Perhaps they're not the only ones having trouble unwinding this mess of fraudulent GME shares?\n\nWhat do APE think?  \n\nI googled the above and found a few other postings on linkedin so they must be working with multiple consultancy firms. Here is one of them:\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/operations-analyst-at-software-guidance-assistance-inc-sga-inc-2540015080](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/operations-analyst-at-software-guidance-assistance-inc-sga-inc-2540015080)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to rip this apart if you know more; I'm just an ape fighting for the cause of making scumbag billionaires like Ken Kaniff from Connecticut into former billionaires one GME share at a time.\n\nOn a totally unrelated note, but also kinda related, I transferred all of my positions from E\\*Trade to Vanguard this week and everything BUT my GME Shares came through, options contracts were fine. \n\nFor some reason, my GME Shares are in the ether but It's too early in the transfer process to know whether fuckery is afoot. I guess I'll know more when I see my cost basis. Will update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Banks appear to be trying to cover their asses by paying a lot of money to outside consultants to reconcile their likely clusterfucked trade data. Most likely as a direct result of the new DTCC/SEC rules putting pressure on them to do so.** \n\n**Funny what happens when people do their fucking job \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I reached out to the recruiter to schedule an interview. I'll divulge more info if I make it that far in the interview process lmao\n\n\nEdit: some apes have correctly pointed out that this prob doesn\u2019t mean anything on its own and I agree that\u2019s why It\u2019s just possible DD. \n\nI still think there\u2019s a lot of recon value given that the language in the description seemed very specific to the discussions we\u2019ve been having here.\n\nAs others pointed out, in a vacuum a job description might just be a standard position they post from time to time but if we start seeing more of these pop up from banks, it can be a kind of canary in the coal mine that banks are scrambling.\n\nLike a slightly more sophisticated version of the watch the lights on the buildings thing ppl have been doing lol\n\nTo that end, I\u2019m gonna paste u/chuckfina74 \u2018s comment below since I think it can turn this info into something more actionable:\n\n*This is a way tech companies reverse engineer what their competitors are up to as well.\n\nDatabases such as Indeed and Glassdoor are a good place for OSINT.\n\n\u201cMaybe SWIM should automate tracking financial job descriptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d focus on contractors, because any company involved in shady stuff is sure as shit going to terminate anyone who finds bad stuff, and it\u2019s easier to \u201cend a contact\u201d than it is to get HR and lawyers involved in FTE terminations.\u201c*",
