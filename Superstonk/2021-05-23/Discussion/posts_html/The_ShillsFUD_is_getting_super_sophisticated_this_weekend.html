<p>It's not as blatant as before, because now they are pretending to be apes, and getting pretty good at it with ape lingo.</p>
<p>I've seen:</p>
<p>Asking legitimate questions that seem like they're searching for DD, but then as you read further into their posts comments, they're just spreading FUD.</p>
<p>Giving apes advice, but sending them to suspect sites and clicking on unverified links that may try to phish for ape information. </p>
<p>And I'm also seeing since last night and today, price anchoring coming back into play, but at slightly higher levels, as well as advising apes to sell a few on the way up and letting the rest ride. This is NOT the way.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>We've been infiltrated. </p>
<p>This weekend may seem calm on the surface, but make no mistake and read between the lines.. the sleeper cells have been activated.</p>
