<p>Some friends and Redditors have mentioned where they're going to dump their profits back into the market immediately after making a profit. For the love of fuck don't do it. </p>
<p>We've all come to completely see just how much of a casino this whole market is, and you better believe banks and funds will have already cooked up a scheme to get that money back asap. </p>
<p>As far as crypto, if you haven't figured out what kind of a ponzie scheme it is and how much money banks and hedgies have been taking from retail investors, you're due to just write a check directly to your favourite bank. </p>
<p>If you're already rich, getting greedy won't make anything any better.</p>
