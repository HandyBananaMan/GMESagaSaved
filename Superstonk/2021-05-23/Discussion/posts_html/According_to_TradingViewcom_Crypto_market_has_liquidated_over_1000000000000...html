<p>So i have seen several posts debating firstly the potential size of the collective payout that is going to come for GME, and secondly what the maximum price that will actually be paid for GME is likely to be.</p>
<p>While everything is a hypothetical until it happens, and I am by no means a maths guy, I submit that the evidence of massive liquidations of the crypto currency market which we strongly think is being cyclically pumped and dumped to raise cash for Citadel and co, I submit that the grand total of 1 Trillion dollars so far just on crypto means that we control the price.</p>
<p>There are of course the usual caveats that not all of this is GME related, or Citadel related, but involve every other possible reason in addition for every other player involved, preparations for Atobitt to release HOC 2 and 3 and trigger the liquidity crisis, and yada tada yada you get the point.</p>
<p>But, caveats aside, the fact that 1 Trillion dollars has already been pulled out of just one sector of the market in preparation should be sufficient to jack your tits.</p>
<p>Every single share of Gamestop both real and synthetic, in market, in dark pools, in ETFs, in options and calls and puts and shorts and everything else under the sun, every single one of them already has a designated owner before this started. Remember that. Before apes began mass buying and holding every single share was already owned. And now they're all “owned“ many times over. What fun.</p>
<p>This is why they cheated and lied and stole and counterfeited more shares than could ever exist in this company. This is why it is impossible for them to close their positions. This is why they are collectively collecting 1 Trillion dollars just to start with.</p>
<p>Because every single paper handed bitch in the world selling low couldnt possibly change this maths now that so many synthetic shares are due. Every single share, real and synthetic, must be purchased at whatever price is available. And as the paper hands leave, and shares concentrate in the diamond hands of the apes, the price to buy increases exponentially.</p>
<p>All shorts must cover</p>
<p>This is why you are going to win.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/global-charts/">Link to TradingView source</a> damn watching that go down in real time across the whole crypto, rather than any particular stock is quite the sight.</p>
<p>Edit 2 shills got to pump it</p>
