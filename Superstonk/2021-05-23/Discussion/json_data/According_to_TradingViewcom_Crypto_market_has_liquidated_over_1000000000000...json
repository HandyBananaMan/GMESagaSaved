Remember that. Before apes began mass buying and holding every single share was already owned. And now they're all \u201cowned\u201c many times over. What fun.\n\nThis is why they cheated and lied and stole and counterfeited more shares than could ever exist in this company. This is why it is impossible for them to close their positions. This is why they are collectively collecting 1 Trillion dollars just to start with.\n\nBecause every single paper handed bitch in the world selling low couldnt possibly change this maths now that so many synthetic shares are due. Every single share, real and synthetic, must be purchased at whatever price is available. And as the paper hands leave, and shares concentrate in the diamond hands of the apes, the price to buy increases exponentially.\n\nAll shorts must cover\n\nThis is why you are going to win.\n\nEdit: [Link to TradingView source](https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/global-charts/) damn watching that go down in real time across the whole crypto, rather than any particular stock is quite the sight.\n\nEdit 2 shills got to pump it\n\n[Headline 1: Bitcoin tumbles 50&#37;. Headline 2: Buy now you fool. Transparent much](https://preview.redd.it/hywxgvkqrx071.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cc378aeff2e99171575895b61a1dfe1c4de4655)",
