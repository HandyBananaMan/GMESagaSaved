For the love of fuck don't do it. \n\nWe've all come to completely see just how much of a casino this whole market is, and you better believe banks and funds will have already cooked up a scheme to get that money back asap. \n\nAs far as crypto, if you haven't figured out what kind of a ponzie scheme it is and how much money banks and hedgies have been taking from retail investors, you're due to just write a check directly to your favourite bank. \n\nIf you're already rich, getting greedy won't make anything any better.",
