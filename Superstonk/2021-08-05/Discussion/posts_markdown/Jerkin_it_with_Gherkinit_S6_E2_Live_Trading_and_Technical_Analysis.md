Good Morning Apes!

Just another day of watching SHFs bleed millions while we sit and hold. Remember to always be grateful for the massive discounts provided to us by Big Mayo.

Thank you for the cheaper stonks!

# After-Market 

Sorry forgot to drop the last update before I did the interview today. Closed pretty flat after that last test. Looks like we may have a confirmed bounce finally on that long term trend and closed our first green day in weeks! Thank you all so much and for the questions during the interview.

Slow climb failed a test of 157, might consolidate and test again

Edit 3 1:17

Pretty flat since our last run up to 154 looks like it's testing the waters at 155 again

Edit 2 11:01

Gamestop volume picking up as it climbs the lower part of the ramp, looks like a bounce slow and unconfirmed but looks good all the same

Edit 1 9:54

Flat open a little red on the day and trading below VWAP but low enough volume that I'm not too worried about big moves right now

# Pre-Market Analysis

Yesterday we dropped onto a bit of a gamma slide that goes all the way down to 110, while I don't think they will spend the capital or worse yet risk the exposure of attempting to drive us that low, the open interest is there and I want apes to be prepared for the worst. It is unlikely that this downward ramp is SHFs as I have seen no large institutional orders go through for OTM puts I assume these contracts were bought a long time ago. Also the selling off of this ramp as we hit it can increase or upwards momentum on a bounce and slam us right into that gamma ramp. Around 13k volume traded and 75k shares available to borrow going into market open we are trading down 0.27% from market close. We are still within range of this weeks predicted trend.
