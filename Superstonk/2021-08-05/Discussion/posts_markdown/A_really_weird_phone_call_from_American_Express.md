Good Morning Apes  


Wanted to share with you a really weird phone call I got from American Express yesterday.   


Just to set the scene. My credit score is fantastic, I use my credit card to get miles and pay in full every month. I have never missed a payment, and this months utilisation of credit was about 4-5% of the overall credit limit. This certain card has "no pre set spending limit" but I know the approximate limit of where AMEX draws the line in the sand. 

I checked my credit file - nothing has changed. And nothing has changed in my financial life that would make any difference to my credit file.  


When the statement arrived, as always it gives the full balance, payment due and the date due. The due date of this card was the 29th of August.

I got a call asking for "immediate payment" otherwise my card would be locked until at least the minimum payment is made. (This was not a scam, as always with AMEX and Banks I call back on the trusted number I have for them whenever they reach out to me for issues)  


I asked why as I have until the 29th of August to pay - and they said that it was just algorithms change all the time depending on credit situations. I explained my credit has not changed and there is nothing in my file that would make me a risk to them.  


The person on the phone didn't really know what was going on - but just said that computer says that I needed to pay in full immediately even though I have until the 29th of August to pay, and that was the end of the conversation. 

I just have a gut feeling that this might be AMEX trying to sure up good credit / collateral / cash from people they know have paid on time always, to ride a possible upcoming storm. I just found it really weird that with no marks against my name, and really good credit, AMEX needed full payment today.
