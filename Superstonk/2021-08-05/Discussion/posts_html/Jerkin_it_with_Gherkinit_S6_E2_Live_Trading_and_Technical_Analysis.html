<h1>After-Market</h1>
<p>Sorry forgot to drop the last update before I did the interview today. Closed pretty flat after that last test. Looks like we may have a confirmed bounce finally on that long term trend and closed our first green day in weeks! Thank you all so much and for the questions during the interview.</p>

<p>Edit 4 2:06</p>
<p>Slow climb failed a test of 157, might consolidate and test again</p>

<p>Edit 3 1:17</p>
<p>Pretty flat since our last run up to 154 looks like it's testing the waters at 155 again</p>

<p>Edit 2 11:01</p>
<p>Gamestop volume picking up as it climbs the lower part of the ramp, looks like a bounce slow and unconfirmed but looks good all the same</p>

<p>Edit 1 9:54</p>
<p>Flat open a little red on the day and trading below VWAP but low enough volume that I'm not too worried about big moves right now</p>

<h1>Pre-Market Analysis</h1>
<p>Yesterday we dropped onto a bit of a gamma slide that goes all the way down to 110, while I don't think they will spend the capital or worse yet risk the exposure of attempting to drive us that low, the open interest is there and I want apes to be prepared for the worst. It is unlikely that this downward ramp is SHFs as I have seen no large institutional orders go through for OTM puts I assume these contracts were bought a long time ago. Also the selling off of this ramp as we hit it can increase or upwards momentum on a bounce and slam us right into that gamma ramp. Around 13k volume traded and 75k shares available to borrow going into market open we are trading down 0.27% from market close. We are still within range of this weeks predicted trend.</p>
