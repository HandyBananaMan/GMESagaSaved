<p>Let us get right to the chase. Apes have a bad habit of hero worshipping. The tendency to hero worship comes from the inability of many apes to discern between useful and non-useful information. Example: We usually abide by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o5sg7t/the_wrinkle_brain_system/">wrinkle brain system</a> to filter out bad info.</p>
<p>However, sometimes individuals of questionable loyalty slip into the public eye of apes and cause problems. I'm sure some names are coming to mind as you read this. I believe there is some major forum sliding happening right now, brewed by our enemies via narrative propaganda. <strong>Our enemies have figured out a way to get the apes to slide the forum themselves</strong>, thanks to Satori and our mod team clearing out most of the shills. The model for this propaganda attack is quite straightforward.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify a "problem" and create a sense of urgency via fabricated narrative.</li>
<li>Shine the spotlight on an individual who "solves" the "problem".</li>
<li>The individual acts as a Trojan horse, gaining community trust for playing their part in the fake narrative.</li>
<li>Spread false info or massive FUD by expending or leveraging the trust built up before.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example: We've seen this model enacted by Cramer a few times. He will generally try to play on the ape's side for a few days, and tout a suggestion or call to action after some level of trust has been perceived as acquired. The suggestion flips like a pancake, and Cramer's true intentions are once again shown as obvious as the sun.</p>
<p>The entire narrative surrounding Gary and SEC is rife with red flags. The fabricated narrative includes some partial truth about the GameStop narrative, but fails to paint a full picture. This is indicative of Trojan horse style narrative fabrication.</p>
<p>The full GameStop narrative is fundamentally about naked shorting. However, instead of addressing this fundamental narrative at all, a partially true narrative about dark pools is presented. By omitting the core of the issue a narrative is fabricated, and Gary conveniently appears with some implied solutions.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind the underlying motivations of different parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>CNBC - Paid for by the shorts. Their entire operation is designed to push the agenda of a small number of very wealthy people. The best course of action would be to simply ignore CNBC and not bring attention to them. They are not the gatekeepers of information; we don't need CNBC in any way.</li>
<li>SEC/Gary - Please keep in mind the GameStop situation created a national security issue in January. The market, and by extension the federal government, was not ready for a real short squeeze. The price was going to destroy the core market structures. However, the stock market is a critical piece of the American state. If it suddenly fell a massive vulnerability would open up and threaten US dominance in the global sphere. This will never be allowed to happen. Right now the top decision makers regarding the US market are laser focused on preventing a national security nightmare from occurring. They don't care about retail, they don't even necessarily care about the shorts. They are not our friends, or enemies of our enemy. They're looking for the cheapest way out of this mess, and cheapest means less tendies for apes.</li>
<li>Due to the extreme circumstances of the GameStop situation, different parties that would usually not act together are now incentivized to temporarily collude. This manifests through things like short ladder attacks, off-exchange trading, communal can-kicking, and in my opinion the worst of all -- elaborate narrative fabrication.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best thing for apes to do is wait for data points. Wait to see what actions different entities take. The actions speak to true intentions. Ignoring all the noise and waiting for data points basically nullifies the entire propaganda steps and goes straight to illuminating step 4.</p>
<p>Let us name the most trusted people in the GameStop saga. DFV, Cohen, Dr. T, Wes, atobitt - these are some of our favorites. What do they all have in common? Their actions have spoken over time  as impossible to fake indicators of their true intentions. Any new personas or entities must stand the test of time where their actions are judged as objective data points. There is no skipping this process allowed, else we end up with forum sliding, or worse.</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>It's important for apes to maintain their focus, else the forum will continue to slide. <strong>It's difficult to find DD or data regarding GameStop on our sub right now, and frankly that's just sad.</strong> Instead our sub looks like a bunch of paid advertising for CNBC. Please remember, nothing good comes from highlighting information from mainstream media outlets. We don't need them and all of their content serves to harm us.</p>
