<p>Good Morning Apes  </p>
<p>Wanted to share with you a really weird phone call I got from American Express yesterday.   </p>
<p>Just to set the scene. My credit score is fantastic, I use my credit card to get miles and pay in full every month. I have never missed a payment, and this months utilisation of credit was about 4-5% of the overall credit limit. This certain card has "no pre set spending limit" but I know the approximate limit of where AMEX draws the line in the sand. </p>
<p>I checked my credit file - nothing has changed. And nothing has changed in my financial life that would make any difference to my credit file.  </p>
<p>When the statement arrived, as always it gives the full balance, payment due and the date due. The due date of this card was the 29th of August. </p>

<p>I got a call asking for "immediate payment" otherwise my card would be locked until at least the minimum payment is made. (This was not a scam, as always with AMEX and Banks I call back on the trusted number I have for them whenever they reach out to me for issues)  </p>
<p>I asked why as I have until the 29th of August to pay - and they said that it was just algorithms change all the time depending on credit situations. I explained my credit has not changed and there is nothing in my file that would make me a risk to them.  </p>
<p>The person on the phone didn't really know what was going on - but just said that computer says that I needed to pay in full immediately even though I have until the 29th of August to pay, and that was the end of the conversation. </p>
<p>I just have a gut feeling that this might be AMEX trying to sure up good credit / collateral / cash from people they know have paid on time always, to ride a possible upcoming storm. I just found it really weird that with no marks against my name, and really good credit, AMEX needed full payment today.</p>
