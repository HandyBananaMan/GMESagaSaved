<p>Filing to sell 98 million shares held by shareholders. Who didn’t see that coming fucking scumbags. Pump the stock, sell options on their own app then sell the rip.</p>
<p>Where’s all that money going, who are the shareholders selling?</p>
<p>Price tanking in premarket, are all the shareholders that bought the IPO still locked in and unable to sell? </p>
<p>Manipulation at its finest, what a bunch of crooks. </p>
<p>Fuck them, hopefully they burn and people jump ship more now as pfof hopefully gets burnt to the ground.</p>
