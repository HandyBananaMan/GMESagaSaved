Filing to sell 98 million shares held by shareholders. Who didn’t see that coming fucking scumbags. Pump the stock, sell options on their own app then sell the rip.

Where’s all that money going, who are the shareholders selling?

Price tanking in premarket, are all the shareholders that bought the IPO still locked in and unable to sell? 

Manipulation at its finest, what a bunch of crooks. 

Fuck them, hopefully they burn and people jump ship more now as pfof hopefully gets burnt to the ground.
