RC has a CIK, everything he files with SEC will be attached to this number. See for yourself:

https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001767470&entityName=Cohen%2520Ryan%2520(CIK%25200001767470)&startdt=2001-05-01&enddt=2021-08-04

RC is 100% GME, just like my portfolio.

Other post thinking it's him is going haywire. 

CIK is what apes use to look up what Kenny G, J Yass, Stevie C and other shitheads are up to.


EDIT: In all the craziness Charlie's new post got lost. Everyone look at it, it seems more important than what we're discussing here.
