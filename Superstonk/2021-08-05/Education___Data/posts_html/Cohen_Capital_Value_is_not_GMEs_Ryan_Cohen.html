<p>RC has a CIK, everything he files with SEC will be attached to this number. See for yourself:</p>

<p>RC is 100% GME, just like my portfolio.</p>
<p>Other post thinking it's him is going haywire. </p>
<p>CIK is what apes use to look up what Kenny G, J Yass, Stevie C and other shitheads are up to.</p>
<p>EDIT: In all the craziness Charlie's new post got lost. Everyone look at it, it seems more important than what we're discussing here.</p>
