It is becoming evident that citadel is perfecting the ability to route sales through the darkpool to minimize the impact purchasing has on price. I think it is important that EVERYONE be aware of the bigger implications of this action:

SHOULD THE SEC FAIL TO TAKE ACTION, INVESTMENT NO LONGER HAS ANY VALUE OR PURPOSE. 

We are talking about a total market failure here, not just a crash. It impacts institutional and retail investors alike. If you wish to invest in a company you believe has the potential for long term success, but the markertmaker has decided to kill it, your investment has no chance of growing.

Basically: if the market can be directly controlled beyond the actions of an investor, then there is no risk/reward profile outside of those companies the marketmaker chooses to bless with success. 

Without the driving action- the potential to throw investments into a company and see it grow your equity, all investment would ultimately cease. No investor, institutional or retail, backs a company simply out of the joy of giving up their cash. They expect a return on their investment. If an external third party now has the power to make your investment fail regardless of company success, would you ever risk your money in the market again? 

We need to make people aware of what the SEC is allowing to happen right now. People need to understand how this undermines confidence in the free market. I really dont care how we do it. #fraudulentmarket on twitter or just getting the word out on reddit and other social media, but we have to make the implications of this crystal clear. And no, this isnt coordinating to manipulate stock price or offer investment tips. This is people coming together to voice their desire for a free market beyond the control of illicit hedgefund action. 

TL;DR: get on social media and spread awareness that the market can now be directly manipulated by the marketmaker at will, and no company is safe.
