When GME squeezes, most financial experts will essentially be archeologists. They will fully understand the dynamics of GME\u2019s Short Squeeze after the fact. With that said, instead of asking questions like..\u201dOoh ooh ahh ahh. Dr. T. Will GME squeeze\u201d? We need to focus on asking questions about the market manipulation preventing GME from squeezing. \n\nThanks,",
