Apes,

We should be inviting experts to do AMAs so they can shed some light on information specifically pertaining to their specialty. When GME squeezes, most financial experts will essentially be archeologists. They will fully understand the dynamics of GME’s Short Squeeze after the fact. With that said, instead of asking questions like..”Ooh ooh ahh ahh. Dr. T. Will GME squeeze”? We need to focus on asking questions about the market manipulation preventing GME from squeezing. 

Thanks,
