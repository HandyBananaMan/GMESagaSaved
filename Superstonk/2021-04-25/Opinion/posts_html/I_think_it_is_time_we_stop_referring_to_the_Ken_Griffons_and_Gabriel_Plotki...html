<h1>Title: I think it is time we stop referring to the Ken Griffons and Gabriel Plotkins as short-sellers. These people have resolved to wreck companies, and now possibly the US economy via shorting treasuries. They are economic terrorists and I think it is time we refer to them as such.</h1>

<p>I really hope this catches on, because these people seem to be fine wrecking the economy and only get away with fines.  But maybe that is our fault for calling them businessmen.  Let's take control of the narrative here.  These men destroyed companies.  They indirectly let to people dying from unemployment.  They paid for laws to be passed so they can destroy the dollar and get away with it.  Maybe we start referring to them as economic terrorist, since that is what they are.  They control the narrative because they pay for it.  They show fear to get laws passed to favor them.  They bribe politicians.  These people are terrorists so let's refer to them as such.</p>
<p>Edit:  Since this got a lot of traction, I feel it necessary to let people know that this is my opinion.  Let it be known that I do believe short-selling is necessary to counter certain risks in a market, but there is a limit to where you do this to hedge a bet versus doing this and attempting to bankrupt a company.  These short sellers got caught trying to rig the game, and then continued to try and rig it to their advantage through a variety of legal loopholes.  They could have let the squeeze happen, taken their loss, and gone home.  They didnt want to lose.  Psychopaths rarely do.  (Not that these people are psychopaths, but studies have proven that people in these positions are statistically more likely to be.)  Their plan failed, they started shorting ETFs.  Now it is tied into other areas of the economy.  They might even be shorting treasuries, so now our dollar value is at risk.  They literally have leveraged themselves to a point where if they go down, they may possibly take the whole economy with them.</p>
