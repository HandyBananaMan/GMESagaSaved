This is something that a lot of people have already discussed, but I feel like it has not yet been phrased the way I want people to understand it.

Dr. Trimbath was first mentioned following atobitt's House of Cards post which highlighted issues that come with the way DTCC runs the securities business- naked short selling and failures to deliver. And those are the 3 main subject around which you should ask the questions: DTCC, naked shorting, FTDs. I don't think GME should be the subject at all.Don't ask her if Citadel is naked shorting GME. Aske her how naked shorting works, how you can detect them or measure their scope.Don't ask her if hedgies are hiding FTDs in dark pools. Aske her how FTDs can be manipulated.Don't ask her if estimated numbers posted here are remotely accurate. Ask her if DTCC themselves even know what the hell is actually going on or if they even have the ability to ever figure out what has been going on.

And then, after we grow some wrinkes on our brains, we might be able to apply it to GME.

As a side not, I'm also kinda sceptical about AMAs and how they go against out confirmation bias, but I hate people sayong that "it's just an opinion of one person and they haven't read the god-like DD we have read". Yeah, those people are not invested into GME specificaly as we are and it's not like an opinion of some people can defy how really damn suspicious (too suspicious to be a coincidence) GME is, but it still makes you sound like a cultist.
