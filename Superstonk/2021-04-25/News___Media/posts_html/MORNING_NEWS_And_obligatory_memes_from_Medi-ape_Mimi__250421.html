<p>- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$</p>
<p>- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!</p>
<p>- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.</p>
<p>- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.</p>
<p>- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.</p>

<p><em>"Now taking a closer look at the pendants themselves.</em></p>
<p><em>When drawing a pendant I exclude the overextensions of the stock and focus on confirmed trends. In Figure 2 the resistant line is very clear leaving me with high confidence in it's position.</em></p>
<p><em>The dashed support is at a minimum, a very heavy support line that hasn't been broken after February unless GME was oversold.</em></p>
<p><em>The solid yellow support is difficult to define with only two solid contacts and the stocks tendency to hug the resistance. However the two points it does contact have a strong correlation.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/s9idf80a5av61.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb1a849100a7655acb0909fd12b3e36612aed552">GME TA</a></p>
<p><em>Assuming the validity of the triangle, how high should we expect the stock to jump when the break the pattern?</em></p>
<p><em>Using a starting price of $4.20 and a peak of $420 we can expect the price to reach upwards of $800. Typically the rally is a little less than the increase of the runup. If you are a believer in Fibonacci, I would tell you that $680 is more likely.</em></p>
<p><em>The ONLY way to confirm the pattern is to see an increase in both price and volume. Due to the longer than average length of the pendant, without a significant push the pendant's prevalence will fade and should be looked at as a consolidation moving forward. We are nearing the end of the pendant and that is exciting, however I think it is far more likely the resistance line will continue to persist without a catalyst. "</em></p>
<p><strong>ELIA: we might break out of big triangle and go up. But triangle is very big so we need more volume.</strong></p>

<p><em>"We are definitely in or moving into a zone of low volatility that favors a Bullish move. This allows long whales to set up potential gamma squeezes.

<p><em>This is a manipulated stock, in that sense technical indicators are only as good as the extent of the perceived manipulation.

<p><em>"Now lets focus on the FINRA data as that gives us the short/long ratio. FINRA reports</em> <strong><em>1,293,673,781</em></strong> <em>shares traded since the beginning of the year and</em> <strong><em>610,188,947</em></strong> <em>of those trades are short positions, that's a staggering</em> <strong><em>47.17%</em></strong> <em>of all trades coming through FINRA. Why is FINRA different to NYSE data? Simply they don't report on all exchanges it's likely just trades via the NASDAQ, whereas the NYSE is reporting all trades.</em></p>
<p><em>Using the FINRA data again, since the start of the year (4th Jan)</em> <strong><em>16,800,958</em></strong> <em>is the average volume and</em> <strong><em>7,924,532</em></strong> <em>is the average short volume.

<p><em>47.17% of 2,904,446.487 = 1,370,027,407.92 short shares</em></p>

<p><em>So once again I just want to remind everyone that the float is 16,164,355 because 1,534,419,079.08 is 9492.6% of that. So IF every ape from 4th Jan bought and hodl until today then retail would own 9,492.6% of the actual tradable float. That hasn't happened we know that BUT using this information in my opinion speculating that retail owns more than 1,000% of the float is very conservative.</em></p>
<p><em>Let's say half of the 1.5B orders have been made by diamond apes, 767,209,539.54 shares.. that would be 4,746.3% of the float that is actually accessible to retail.

<li><em>What perpetuates the corruption is their capacity to buy more time. To trip the MOASS, we must disable the proverbial snooze button on their margin calls. Voting as a common shareholder may be the way.</em></li>
<li><em>When retail investors purchase whole GME share(s) from their stockbroker, depending on which broker, it is unclear whether they purchased a real share from some other investor selling theirs, or if they purchased a synthetic/fake share that was created from corrupt actions by hedge funds (e.g. deep ITM stock options)</em></li>
<li><em>Does it matter which stock we have?</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/z01I0jJ"><em>No</em></a><em>. A whole share, real or synthentic, entitles you to a vote.</em></li>
