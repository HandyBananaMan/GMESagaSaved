\----------------------------------------------------------

This is a continuation of my last post, please read it first. I found some very interesting info which was left out last time.

Found some more info about Good ole Stevie

![Sus since the 80's.](https://preview.redd.it/g5fa7n3muev61.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f390562cb687677afe74a1f4c35f2b2f9b44a32)

Cohen was deposed by the SEC as early as 1986. He was being looked at suspicious trading involving General Electric. Never got indicted and he plead the 5th so no juicy info.

![juicy info](https://preview.redd.it/2ic7rl3cvev61.jpg?width=1132&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57033b137fb207d7614737a46b3461242df8270d)

FBI found a former SAC employee. He explained to them that providing Cohen with insider information was part of the job.

![Employees see things](https://preview.redd.it/lz4fn22uvev61.jpg?width=1203&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e886f9021d0e4a906a1e80481cbb18631d1f2164)

Many of Cohen's employees could see that Cohen was talking to some random new manager. They spoke privately, and Cohen would always back his decisions. 

![The Department of Justice gets involved](https://preview.redd.it/2ibb4kqewev61.jpg?width=1119&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdb5835bc92e48c4bc925ac03f3c768b979b22b8)

Cohen would only speak to Martoma in person. Emails would just be "hey can you talk" or something along those lines. Martoma bragged about having a "black edge" which the Department of Justice said was a term used to mean "insider information." They literally knew that Cohen was getting insider information but didn't charge him. [Source](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/13/empire-edge) for screenchots above

![Catches up to you](https://preview.redd.it/4n82gmd7xev61.jpg?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a483a9a1e6afb1dc22c821b536456bceaf171eb5)

Steve eventually pled guilty to securities fraud, but was only fined.

![No charges for the rich](https://preview.redd.it/5vu8yyojxev61.jpg?width=1046&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4f54e929cd085279e4dc60cb2c74b7ab0e8e146)

Prosecutors described it as "without any known precedent in the history of hedge funds." Still didn't charge him personally. And as we know in the present day, the other investigation mentioned in the screenshot didn't end up with him being stopped from continuing his activities either.

![Civil lawsuit, not criminal](https://preview.redd.it/6197vtj2yev61.jpg?width=1041&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab990d5110fe7eb0c61dc84982a8c0076122a6ba)

Its a shame when the victims has to sue the criminals because the police don't do their job. The deposition was from a civil lawsuit filed by fairfax financial holdings. They claimed SAC was spreading false info to drive their stock price down.

Now lets talk about his media control.

![Media in their pocket](https://preview.redd.it/43zjjz93lev61.jpg?width=1925&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56283f848e2f0bcda6e3f3e73538bd9550d8daa2)

Steve Cohen was getting more media attention which he didn't like. The man has only done 2 interviews throughout his over 40 year career. Reuters was about to do a story on reports that Steve did a little teensy weensy itty bitty insider trading during the 80's. He was alerted to this when they asked for a comment. Rather than simply providing his side of the story, he got rid the story altogether. Calling up the CEO of Reuters' Markets and having it shelved.

![Would've loved to see it](https://preview.redd.it/hb5ny3nhmev61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bcda4ec764d8006fe2430f88aefed2661934c76)

Matthew Goldstein, the investigative journalist who made the story, was using some documents as the basis for his work, and Reuters' lawyers approved it for publishing. [Source](https://talkingbiznews.com/they-talk-biz-news/reuters-kills-hedge-fund-story-after-pressure/)

Now continuing where I left off on my previous post. We might never know what Matthew found in those documents, but we do know this:

![Has to just be a clickbait headline... right?](https://preview.redd.it/uc5377yfoev61.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edc711e8c48932272733462fa7fc028941eadedf)

You read that right. During a discovery period where emails were handed over to Overstock, they accidently didn't redact some important parts, namely some dirt about naked short-selling.

![not looking too good](https://preview.redd.it/tmkoyurwoev61.jpg?width=992&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3ae2edb62c2f32b2dc0a294200e452aea2e65fc)

Emails reveal that they talked about how to make certain "fails" happen. They disregarded the procedures, and told their clients that they could do the same.

![subtle](https://preview.redd.it/z74ddlyfpev61.jpg?width=965&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd2552742d298ea007c10c779cfebc12c1fdfcc9)

Literally just confirmed that they wanted to fail the stocks without borrowing any shares. 

This is why I'm so mad at overstock for settling their lawsuit when they had so much on their side but didn't go through with it. They could've set a precedent but left with cash for themselves.

![court docuement](https://preview.redd.it/9navneslqev61.jpg?width=983&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f15dee0b4f826ed5f07f8b91fa5d165f13107b3)

You can see there were some arguments over the legality within Merrill's community. The president of Merrill was the one who said "fuck the compliance area - procedures, schmecedures." Others were concerned about naked short selling.

![More court documents. Spicy](https://preview.redd.it/amvbx6k8rev61.jpg?width=987&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c53b9a7944dad5da18bc16ec62a794e67c2f4520)

As you can see, they were concerned with failing the stock without actually borrowing anything. They said that availability didn't matter (hmmm wonder why) and that they were purposefully shorting to make them fail.
