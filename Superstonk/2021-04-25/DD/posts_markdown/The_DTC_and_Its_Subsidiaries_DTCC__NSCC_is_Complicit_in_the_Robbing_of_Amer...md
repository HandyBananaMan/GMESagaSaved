First of all, this is not financial advice. I am just a crayon-chewing ape like many of you, but I did have experience in the financial services industry and I just have to say how impressed I am with the sheer amount of quality DD & financial analyses you apes do. It would make the most senior analysts on Wall Street hang their heads in shame. As many of you fellow apes have been aware,  Dr. Susanne Trimbath raised the alarm regarding the dangers of FTDs and naked short selling wayy back and wrote a pretty good book about it (highly recommend you check it out, there's lots of posts covering it already) while she was a manager/director at the DTCC.

So I began digging a little deeper into her previous works and interviews. And lo and behold, she gave a run-down of how the game works (On the Motley Fool, of all places) when a little stock called **$OSTK** aka **Overstocked** was found to be the victim of a hedgie short attack **(**[The Share Borrowing Program (SBP)](https://boards.fool.com/qa-with-dr-susanne-trimbath-23885311.aspx?sort=postdate)). Anyway, here are some juicy bits from the interview:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Interviewer:** Some refer to the SBP (Share Borrowing Program) as a “self-replenishing, anonymous lending pool.” Would you agree with this characterization?

**Dr.ST:** *Yes. It is definitely anonymous (unless rules are being broken). And since nothing prevents the buyer who receives a borrowed share for settlement from depositing shares into the lending pool at the Depository, it is self-replenishing.*

**Interviewer:** The DTCC takes great pains to make it clear that the SBP doesn't allow a broker to lend the same share twice via the SBP. My contention is that they certainly allow the same share to be lent by different brokers, thus their rhetoric is disingenuous. Do you agree, or disagree?

**Dr. ST:** *It's a word game. The stock borrow program doesn't track who lent the share (only who borrowed it). So the stock borrow program doesn't allow ANY shares to be lent…only borrowed, get it? They play the same word game when they say they don't make money on the stock borrow program. They don't. What they DO make money on is the stock lending program. By the way, they also make money on fails to deliver. OK, so the same shares aren't lent twice by the same broker because the lender's account is reduced by the number of loaned shares until the loan is repaid. Fine. What they aren't saying is that the shares are a “fungible mass,” and no one keeps track of which share was used to settle which trade. So, a Participant who receives 100 shares of OSTK at settlement could be getting 50 borrowed shares. And it is those 50 shares that can be loaned a second time since all settlement is considered to be “final.”*

What this means is essentially what we've known all along - the NSCC allows its participating members to lend and borrow company shares indefinitely by maintaining a pool of shares that lenders can dump into for interest that borrowers can then borrow from.

At this point, I wanted to know exactly how the SBP actually worked, and stumbled upon a commentary by a certain Dr. Jim DeCosta (Remember this name, b/c if Dr. Trimbath is our Black Widow, then Dr. DeCosta is our Hawkeye). There was a great thread on [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4kuga/naked_short_selling_by_dr_jim_decosta/) that gave some quality DD on him as well. For this post, I'm going to focus on one particular >>[**commentary**](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-30-08/s73008-102.pdf)**<<** he gave which I'll summarize in ape terms below:

**HOW THE SHORT BORROWING PROGRAM (SBP) WORKS**

**1.** Suppose company $GME has 30 million shares that are deposited into the DTCC vault aka **Cede & Co.**  that is available for trading (if you don't know what this is, plz read u/atobitt's [house of cards pt.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/)).

**2.** Then, let's suppose 3 of NSCC's participant clearing houses (CH1, CH2, & CH3) holds 10M shares each in their electronic accounts. Each CH donates 2M shares into the SBP's lending pool. The broker/dealers associated with the clearing houses (B/D1-3) who allow their clients' shares to be lent  receives cash interest for the securities loaned, all without the investors themselves knowing. The SBP now has 6M $GME shares for borrowing.

**3.** Let's say SHF Melvin/Shitadel decides to naked short sell 1M shares from a separate B/D & intentionally refuse to deliver b/c of course, the B/D don't have the friggin' shares and sells it to B/D2's clients. NSCC rule allows Melvin/Shitadel to reach into the SBP's lending pool & extract 1M shares (leaving 5M) & reset the FTD. Let's say those shares were from CH1's pool and shares were from B/D1's clients.

**4.** 1M shares are deducted from CH1's participating pool of 2M, leaving 1M while B/D2's account now has 11M shares. B/D2 can then resubmit these shares anonymously right back into the SBP through a CH, thus replenishing the SBP back to 6M and voila, it's as if no shares left the pool in the first place. No paper cert. left the DTCC's vaults. No paper trail, as if nothing happened. This process can be repeated ad nauseum, and those same shares can have dozens of designated beneficiaries/owners to its name. Meanwhile, share price of $GME drops due to the action of the short-sellers.

**5.** After the above transaction, we are left with the following: CH/1 now has 1M shares remaining of the 2M shares it marked as available to borrow in the SBP-B/D2 has 11M shares on its books, while B/D1 holds 9M.

Now the fun part: CH/1 can now ask the NSCC to credit it with a separate account of 1M share long position in order to make back the 1M that was extracted in the previous transaction, all without the investors' knowing that they're receiving a synthetic since NSCC maintains anonymity of the lender and its investors to avoid legal liability (see no evil). In essence, investors at B/D1 owns 9M of original, paper-backed shares and 1M of synthetic long shares that the NSCC created in a separate account, an IOU account. Due to the insistence by the NSCC of maintaining anonymity amongst the lenders, no one really knows which investors own a proportionate interest in this IOU and by how much, making it an easy cover for the NSCC ("we don't know who has IOUs and who doesn't, so they can't make us tell the SHFs to buy-in their FTDs!").

Meanwhile, all these synthetic shares in the NSCC's account isn't backed by any paper certs. that the DTCC holds, and it just keeps accumulating and grow over time. When asked about it, Dr. Trimbath gave the following answer:

**Interviewer:** \*Any opinion as to how large the total grandfathered position of FTDs was?\***Dr. ST:** *Big enough to give me nightmares.*

TA/DR: The NSCC along with the DTC is complicit in defrauding America's investors and its corporations through a Share Borrowing Program designed to allow its participating members to reset their FTDs while maintaining an air of innocence by professing it is powerless to enforce buy-ins due to a rule that they themselves implemented to uphold a lender's identity.

I'll let Dr. Acosta have the last word:

***“*** \*When this very same party (the DTCC and its subdivisions) that also has 15 of the 16 separate sources of empowerment to execute buy-ins ALSO pleads to be “powerless” to do buy-ins then I’d say we have some “issues” to deal with especially when the financial benefactors of this acting to be “powerless” are the owners of the clearance and settlement system and the bosses of these management teams."\****Dr. Jim DeCosta***

Unless the SEC steps in and force the criminal organization that is the DTCC to clean up its act, this charade will continue and nothing has changed since [2004](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72404/s72404-14.pdf) when the Stock Borrowing Program first came into effect.
