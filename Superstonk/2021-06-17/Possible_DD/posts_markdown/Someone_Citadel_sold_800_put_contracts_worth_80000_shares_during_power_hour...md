You need to understand something before you read this. I have a lot of wrinkles, unfortunately they're on my balls and not on my brain.

[lhatekale](https://old.reddit.com/user/lhatekale) pointed out that someone had sold a lot of put contracts today way in the money at a $300 strike price **45 minutes before close and they expire tomorrow**. So, I did the math to see what it actually cost the purchasers of these puts and was surprised to learn that they had made money by market close. 800 put contracts with a purchase premium of $76.

Value of shares @ $300 strike: 80,000 shares X $300 strike price = $24,000,000

Value of shares @ todays close $223.59: 80,000 shares X $223.59 = $17,887,200

Actual value of the puts: $24,000,000 - $17,887,200 = $6,112,800

Premium to buy 800 puts @ $76 : 80,000 shares x $76 premium = $6,080,000

Profit the buyers of these puts would have made at market close: $6,112,800 - $6,080,000 = $32,800

This didn't make any sense to me. Why would someone sell these puts in the last 45 minutes knowing selling them alone will bring the price down and make them profitable. You're basically giving away money. If the price goes any lower tomorrow the seller's losses will be even more. Maybe they are just selling the contracts to themselves but they were on the market for 40 minutes before someone scooped them up. If I'm not mistaken these major option contracts are almost always created by Market Makers. Since GME is on the NYSE they have only one MM known as a DMM and that's Citadel.

I've been trying to figure out why they would do this.

1. To hide their FTDs and kick the can down the road. This isn't kicking the can very far, just a day and they have always used way out of the money puts to do this that cost just a couple cents per contract.
2. To drop the price. These contracts didn't drop the price very much maybe 80 cents and we all know they drop the price all day everyday without selling crazy put contracts like these.
3. Because they want to buy shares off the market without making the price go up. Everyone's heard of a Market Maker, but have you heard of a Designated Market Maker? On some exchanges you have a MM, multiple companies responsible for all the stocks on the exchange. The NYSE has a DMM, one company manages the stocks they are assigned. Citadel is the DMM for GME and the majority of the stocks on the NYSE. The main purpose of a MM is to insure market liquidity, they are responsible for the order flow. What happens when there are more buyers than sellers or more sellers than buyers? The MM steps in and makes sure that all orders are filled, it's their main purpose. If there are more buyers than sellers they will fill these orders with a temporary short sale and when they can find the share on the market they will purchase it and SEC REG SHO says they have a maximum of t+35 days to deliver that share (bullshit).  This would normally make the price go up because there are more buyers than sellers and the price going up would bring in more sellers. Now imagine you're a DMM, you've shorted the fuck out of a company planning on it going bankrupt, but this backfired and the price is 45X what you shorted it at. You're still responsible for market liquidity, but all the shares of the company you shorted have been bought up and the buyers refuse to sell. You have to figure out a way to make sure all orders are filled when no one is selling their shares and the price doesn't go up. Since you're a MM you have that ability to temporarily sell a share short (naked short). So, your only option is to fill every order with a share that you do not have and can not get. So, how would you buy shares off the market without raising the price? Maybe you could pay people a premium to sell their shares to you through put contracts. But wouldn't that person just go to the market buy those shares and sell them to you? Not if the put contract expires in 24 hours. If they went to the market and bought those shares they'd have to wait t+2 before the transaction settled before they could sell those shares and by then the put contract would have expired, so they can only sell you shares they already have. What's stopping them from just selling the shares they already have to you and then just buying shares to replace them off the market. Nothing, as long as they already have the cash in their account and how many people have cash just sitting in their account. One major flaw I have with this theory is that of all the in the money put contracts I looked at there might have only been a 1,000 contracts worth maybe 100,000 shares. This doesn't really fix their issues. Plus, they only have this opportunity once a month when options expire. Unless they've been doing this with weekly options as well, I haven't looked. So, if they try and sell a lot more of this way in the money contracts tomorrow then maybe this theory holds up, but I doubt it.

These are the theories I've come up with and none of them are a great explanation. I'm hoping if we work together we can figure this out. If you see any mistakes let me know.

Edit: Words. Plus, I'm not sure if I said these puts expire tomorrow...
