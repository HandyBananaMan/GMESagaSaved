# Kicking the Can – FED STYLE

Thanks to /u/nat2035 for the write-up. I'm posting on his behalf as he lacks the karma to post.

Hello fellow Apes,

this is my first little "DD“, I am not a native speaker / Europoor so please forgive my language barrier. I also can’t post on SuperStonk because of Karma restrictions so thank you for uploading u/dreadfulol. Also I eat crayons for a living so this isn'T Financial Advice or anything.

I was listening to the good old JPOW going on about inflation and other really really boring things like inflation expectations, MBS purchases and other nonchalant FED business when I started thinking….

So why in the hell would a central bank / FED, that is currently hitting its inflation targets AND projecting future inflation to rise (PPI 12Months coming in at 5.3%)¹  want to keep on buying the treasuries (that are needed by Banks because of the new collateral quality requirements) AND start buying **at least 40B MBS** every month until “…until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals….”² ?

What the FED is basically saying, is that its current level of quantitative easing (QE) isn’t working and they need to buy more assets/treasuries ergo introduce more liquidity into the market for better achieving the goal of price stability (aka inflation) and maximum employment.This FED- view is contrary to the emergence of new data (as expressed by a Bloomberg journalist in the QA at minute 54:40)³  which is contradicting the current FED-thesis (that the inflation bumps are transistory/temporary and that the FED framework which was of course defended vigorously by JPOW is underestimating real inflation concerns and the rising expected inflation projections) and also turning a blind eye to the systemic risk of too much liquidity in the market.

So why would the FED do this, knowingly accepting higher inflation while simultaneously further increasing liquidity, accelerating the growth of the asset price bubble and therefore elevating the overall risk in the markets?

Here is my take;

1. **Not tapering and introducing more liquidity**Decreasing QE would have tapering effect on the US economy and credit availability, but more importantly would have caused rising interest rates for RMBS and CMBS (residential and commercial mortgage backed securities) as well as further increased the variable interest rates for ABS (Asset backed securities like car loans etc.)We all know that delinquencies on credit loans, mortgages and commercial real estate have skyrocketed during the pandemic but where statistically cancelled out by various executive orders. In their thinking if you are insolvent but you don’t have to declare insolvency due to an executive order you are not really insolvent y’a know \*nudge nudge\* See the following chart for better context:

&#x200B;

![Delinquency Rates over time](https://preview.redd.it/9a6xbkp8et571.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=9284ea04449d57424e08b2a83778d402a6b3833a)

So the statistic looks really good, although, in reality, you are about to witness a MAJOR correction in delinquency rates, Non-performing loans, etc. ⁴

2. **Increasing Asset Purchases especially new MBS Purchases**Looking at the MBS purchases2, do you remember the DD from some weeks back (can’t find the link), where it basically stated that commercial banks were inflating the income values of the applicants/business so that their revenues, risk KPIs, etc. looked a lot better than they actually were?Combine that with the regulation that all the dog-shit MBS/ABS could not be used as collateral anymore and the banks start having a **huge** problem in their balance sheet equation. They can’t get rid of these loans like they used to at face value, they are not priced correctly (overreporting good revenues/income leads to a lower risk premium paid on the interest side and higher ratings from S&P, Moodys) and inflation is slowly but surely crippling the asset side of these commercial banks and thus causing real losses to their balance sheets.

Well, in comes the FED and starts buying up these shitty loans which then leads to

a) A constant demand surge in MBS purchases so that the banks’ balance sheets remain balanced and nice and orderly

b) Higher prices of these assets in general on the balance sheet of the banks (helps them out a lot)

c) The full absorption of the incoming inevitable losses of these loans due to inflation being higher than the risk-premium adjusted interest rate being paid on these MBS

This basically is a transfer of real incoming losses from the banks balance sheets to the FEDs balance sheet therefore protecting bank profits while monetizing MBS losses through the printing press ergo higher inflation.In Germany we have a saying that goes like this: “For Banks, profits are privatized, while losses are shared with the public”

Also they have stated that “…Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.” They are giving themselves a blank-check for buying CMBS if say, I dunno the CMBS market starts taking a major dive due to…hmmm inflation and delinquencies maybe??? I wonder who would profit from those purchases \*Stares at Goldman, JP and Co\*

3. **RRPs and SpEcIaL Purchases** aka “We will crush you with more money than you can fathom”So the FED is continuing to do the overnight RePos and Reverse RePos, no surprise here, but the fine print actually says something **WAY** more disturbing:

“Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; **the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.**”² So our belief that once the RRPs hit 80B per counterparty would stop the can-kicking just flew out of the window. Also please keep in mind, that the 80B were already a **166% increase** from the 30B that it was prior to the change. So the FED is basically saying, if you need Cash **or** Collateral, I got you Fam ;)

Now what does all this mean in the grand scheme of things and especially for GME:

1. The FED under no circumstances wants any blame landing at its door for a “slowing” of the economy. Not from inflation, liquidity problems, bank balance sheets being fucked up or any bad thing. They are the fairy godmother for all wishes (more liquidity, dog-shit MBS transfers, accounting bullshit bingo, whatever you banks want/need I will facilitate).
2. The FED also realizes that inflation is here to stay, but can’t say so and do anything about it without setting off a “taper-tantrum” ⁵ and risking the economy. So they shut their eyes, ears and mouth and pretend everything is OK

&#x200B;

![IMHO this is an accurate description of the FED, SEC, DTCC, OTC...](https://preview.redd.it/h9lle11det571.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=dda67da06d5442f7e3629c0c13dd15014e8e0807)

3. They are actively encouraging the banks to keep on can-kicking this issue until some external event (Archegos anyone?) sets off this bomb and they can convincingly say “If Hedgefunds lie on their short sales aka marking them long, increase their exposure and leverage to unsustainable levels etc. it can’t be our fault! We tried everything to mitigate the risks.”

4. Inflation **will** be the reason for this default event and then setting this thing off into Andromeda. Somewhere in the system, some bank/hedgie/family office will suffer losses from one of their other positions/bets that are too great to recover from and default, kicking the MOASS off.I am **also 100% sure** it WILL not be a SHF going bankrupt because of GME, but more likely a non-event (some numbers going against the predictions, profits plunging, default of a mortgage lender, something like that) that in itself is a small thing, but is the last straw that breaks the camel’s back.I am sure Citadel, JP Morgan, Goldman, DTCC, OCC, and all others have their eyes pierced on their “Bankruptcy Jackpot” Short Bets and the huge short exposure these entail, so that the focus on other issues may be obfuscated.

Also, inflation is the only event in the financial sector that basically scares everyone. Fixed Income values decrease because the real value of the nominal amount decreases and the paid interest is worth less. Stocks go down because of the discounted future earnings decrease due to a higher discount factor. Interest rates rise, so that leverage and credit get more expensive.

**For GME:**

In order for this MOASS to start we need to HODL, Buy more shares and buy more from GME. Q2 numbers need to be at least the Q1 numbers so that no one can say "Well, Q1 was just a lucky break, but now it’s all over!"

The fundamentals are there but we are literally fighting every single rich MoFo out there + the institutions that were supposed to protect the common folk (Congress, SEC just to name a few) as well as truly evil human beings, that thrive on human suffering and have no problem with sacrificing thousands if not millions of people (2008 crisis, the great depression) as long as they have their mansions, yachts and private jets!

Stand together, HoDl Fast and Stay excellent

TL;DR: The FED is actively kicking the can down the road for the banks by providing more collateral, liquidity and safety nets (new MBS purchases). They know the MOASS is near, so they rather risk having very high inflation and neglecting their main reason for existing (price stability and maximum employment) than being responsible for a tapering event that would slow down/ stop the music in the greatest leverage and credit binge in history!
