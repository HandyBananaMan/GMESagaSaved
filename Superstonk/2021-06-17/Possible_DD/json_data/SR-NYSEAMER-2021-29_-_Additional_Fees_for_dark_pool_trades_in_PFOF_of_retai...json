Need someone with more wrinkles.\n\nMy interpretation: It sounds like they want to make it more difficult for PFOF to manipulate the price off-exchange.\n\nThis filing from the NYSE resonates with the statement they made in this article https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-retail-nyse/meme-stock-prices-may-not-properly-reflect-demand-nyse-president-idUSL2N2NY32L which criticizes PFOF directed off-exchange.\n\nEDIT: Title is slightly off, they're not additional fees for hedgies, it's additional incentive for our brokers to route to them instead of dark pools. As u/machiningeveryday notes in the comments, they're trying to be more competitive, so they are increasing credits and decreasing fees to provide incentive for our orders to be sent to NYSE instead of dark pools. \n\n**It lines up perfectly with how the DD predicts dark pools are being abused. As you can see below they are increasing credits for orders that \"add liquidity\" and reducing fees for orders that \"reduce liquidity\"**\n\nThis indicates that they want more trades to execute on exchange instead of letting hedgies dictate the price in dark pools.\n\n\n__________\n\n\n**Key Excepts**\n\n> While Regulation NMS has enhanced competition, it has also fostered a \u201cfragmented\u201d market structure where trading in a single stock can occur across multiple trading centers. When multiple trading centers compete for order flow in the same stock, the Commission has recognized that \u201csuch competition can lead to the fragmentation of order flow in that stock.\u201d Indeed, cash equity trading is currently dispersed across 16 exchanges, numerous alternative trading systems, and broker-dealer internalizers and wholesalers, all competing for order flow. Based on publicly-available information, no single exchange currently has more than 17% market share. Therefore, no exchange possesses significant pricing power in the execution of cash equity order flow. More specifically, the Exchange currently has less than 1% market share of executed volume of cash equities trading.\n\n> The Exchange believes that the ever-shifting market share among the exchanges from month to month demonstrates that market participants can move order flow, or discontinue or \rreduce use of certain categories of products. While it is not possible to know a firm\u2019s reason for shifting order flow, the Exchange believes that one such reason is because of fee changes at any of the registered exchanges or non-exchange venues to which the firm routes order flow. Thecompetition for Retail Orders is even more stark, particularly as it relates to exchange versus off-exchange venues. \n\r\n> The Exchange thus needs to compete in the first instance with non-exchange venues for Retail Order flow, and with the 15 other exchange venues for the portion of Retail Order flow that is not directed off-exchange. Accordingly, competitive forces compel the Exchange to use \rexchange transaction fees and credits, particularly as they relate to competing for Retail Order flow, because market participants can readily trade on competing venues if they deem pricing \rlevels at those other venues to be more favorable.\n\n\n______________________________\n\n\n* A credit of $0.0030 per displayed share for orders designated as Retail Orders that add liquidity. **This credit is higher than the Exchange\u2019s standard credit** that ranges between $0.0024 per share to $0.0027 per share for displayed and MPL orders adding liquidity, depending on Adding ADV.12\n\n*  A fee of $0.0010 per share for MPL orders designated as Retail Orders that remove liquidity. **This fee is lower than the Exchange\u2019s standard fee** of either $0.0026 per share or $0.0030 per share for orders that remove liquidity, depending on Adding ADV.\n\n* A fee of $0.0005 per share for orders designated as Retail Orders executed in an opening auction, unless a more favorable rate applies. **This fee is equivalent to the Exchange\u2019s standard fee** for orders executed in an opening auction",
