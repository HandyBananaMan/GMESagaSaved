#Title: If the "price may not properly reflect demand", aren't options a scam? And if so, aren't there the basis for a class action after the declaration of the chief of NYSE?

Maybe some wrinkled ape can answer this.

I don't look at options, mostly because I'm not in my area of expertise. But if I understand correctly, options are a bet: a bet that in a certain day, the stock has a predetermined price. If I'm right, I can get the stocks or sell the option, if I'm wrong I lose my money.

So, if the chief of NYSE admit that the price for meme stock may not properly reflect the demand, so basically "the price is manipulated", what about all those calls that fell short by a few dollars? Isn't there any legal ramification for a class action against the NYSE or the market makers by whoever bought calls that were OTM in the last months?

Still, that's not my situation, I always bought stocks and only stocks, and this is not an advice or whatever. I'm just curious: is it possible, or is it something that only an ambulance chaser would attempt?

Sorry if I made some mistake. English is not my first language.
