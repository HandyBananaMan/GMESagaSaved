    "selftext": "German ape with smooth brain here.\n\nThe German Broker \"Sparkasse\" has updated the number of outstanding shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Outstanding shares see circle and exclamation mark](https://preview.redd.it/rwgyip45gt571.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e642d6680dfbe458b0829fbe148529171cc5bea)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the first time I've seen such a high number of shares outstanding \ud83d\ude2e\n\nAfter all, the latest \"official\" status from the official filing is as follows:\n\nAs of June 1st 2021 Outstanding Shares numbered 71,815,131 shares. That number includes 2,435,881 restricted shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7yo3axxws571.jpg?width=1030&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef56f5c7e661812d7dfefaf4365046add40a9eee\n\nIf GameStop sells all 5 million shares then the new outstanding Shares will be 76,815,131.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/php561z0xs571.jpg?width=521&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91cb5c6f347a337d43223f36da47cc1c9df049a7\n\nThe \u201eSparkasse\u201c is damn close \ud83d\ude2c so close that the difference is EXACTLY 300,000 shares. Exactly to the share. That can't be a coincidence !\n\nBe nice to each other. Apes together strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nNote from u/vuljanov: \" Just for clarification: Sparkasse ist one of the biggest German Banks and owned by the german districts. They have over 200.000 employees. They have a reputation to be serious. So this is not a small shitty neobroker. But for sure, this doesn't necessary means the figure is correct. But I consider it: BULLISH! \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nThe pronunciation of Sparkasse is \"Spar - Kasse\", which means \"savings bank\", \"savings cashbox\" or \"savings cashier\" \ud83d\ude05",
