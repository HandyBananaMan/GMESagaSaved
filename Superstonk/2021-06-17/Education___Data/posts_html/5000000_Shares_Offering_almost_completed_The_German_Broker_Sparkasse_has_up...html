<p>German ape with smooth brain here.</p>
<p>The German Broker "Sparkasse" has updated the number of outstanding shares.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/rwgyip45gt571.jpg?width=975&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e642d6680dfbe458b0829fbe148529171cc5bea">Outstanding shares see circle and exclamation mark</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is the first time I've seen such a high number of shares outstanding ðŸ˜®</p>
<p>After all, the latest "official" status from the official filing is as follows:</p>
<p>As of June 1st 2021 Outstanding Shares numbered 71,815,131 shares. That number includes 2,435,881 restricted shares.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>If GameStop sells all 5 million shares then the new outstanding Shares will be 76,815,131.</p>

<p>The â€žSparkasseâ€œ is damn close ðŸ˜¬ so close that the difference is EXACTLY 300,000 shares. Exactly to the share. That can't be a coincidence !</p>
<p>Be nice to each other. Apes together strong.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Note from u/vuljanov: " Just for clarification: Sparkasse ist one of the biggest German Banks and owned by the german districts. They have over 200.000 employees. They have a reputation to be serious. So this is not a small shitty neobroker. But for sure, this doesn't necessary means the figure is correct. But I consider it: BULLISH! "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 2:</p>
<p>The pronunciation of Sparkasse is "Spar - Kasse", which means "savings bank", "savings cashbox" or "savings cashier" ðŸ˜…</p>
