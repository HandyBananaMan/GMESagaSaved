<p>DFV tweeted Julia Louis-Dreyfus twice yesterday. <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1405258938543742976?s=20">Here's the second tweet that featured her</a>.</p>
<p>And the screenshot:</p>

<p><strong>It stood out to me that the gif DFV tweeted is watermarked Seinfeld/Hulu. So I searched to see what was up with Seinfeld and Hulu, and there's something big happening in stream land. Seinfeld is leaving Hulu for Netflix. When? June 23rd.</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.mediaplaynews.com/netflix-begins-exclusive-seinfeld-streaming-access-on-june-23/">Here's an article that talks about the June 23rd move</a>. From the article: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Netflix is getting one of the more popular (and lucrative) sitcoms, beginning <strong>June 23 with exclusive streaming access to former NBC hit “Seinfeld.”</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And is Seinfeld leaving Hulu? Fuck yeah. It's Netflix exclusive now and <a href="https://decider.com/2021/06/15/is-seinfeld-leaving-hulu/">here's another article that talks about the transition</a>; this article says, </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Seinfeld will be gone from Hulu on June 24.</strong> Actually, it’ll leave on June 23 at 11:59 p.m., to be precise. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what else is Julia Louis-Dreyfus doing? <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/julia-louis-dreyfus-a24-tuesday-1234759834/">She's staring in a show called "Tuesday."</a> </p>
<p>Tuesday!?! My smooth brain looked at that info and found a calender to confirm that Tuesday of next week is the 22nd... so 22nd through 24th. I have no idea what this mean, but I'm buying more GameStop today. Just in case. </p>
<p>I'd personally be quite pissed if we moon next week because I want to moon this week, but that <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1405340821520592896?s=20">share offering RC did</a>... How close is it to being completed? And when can it be announced after it's completed? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1tt0b/5000000_shares_offering_almost_completed_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Here's an ape detective discussion about that on a post by u/Goldjunge_Chriz that shows new GME float numbers populating this morning in Germany</a>. </p>
<p>The share numbers this post implies only 300k shares to go in the offering. So when can RC make the announcement? </p>
<p>u/hammurabi3244 asked: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Smooth brain question: When they are finished with the offering, can they break the news after hours on transaction date or do they need to wait until settlement date? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>u/melt_in_your_mouth replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tuesday I believe. T+2 would be t=today, +2=tomorrow and Monday. Tuesday AM at the earliest if it's done today.</strong> Full disclaimer, I don't know what I'm talking about. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>u/melt_in_your_mouth commented this after u/Spirited_Squash_1535 reminded: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>T+2 minimum is what was said when speculation of ATM arose last Thursday </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmmm.</p>
<p>Full disclaimer, I don't know what I'm talking either and this is just technical tweet analysis shitposting, not financial advice. I just know that my tits are very jacked and, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1403041813431263232?s=20">despite wanting to moon on quad witching day this Friday</a>, I will accept next week moon, Ken. </p>
<p>That's why I just bought more shares of my favorite stock this morning. Just in case. </p>
<p>To the moon, apes. This is not financial advice. I just want us all to have as many moon tickets as possible.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm actually going to go deeper into these tweets this weekend. Why? There's another connection to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/130-30_strategy.asp">130/30 fund scammers</a> in the data. Let's go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
