<p>I have been on the GME train ever since the first DFV updates started going viral on Wsb. Ever since then I have had two sub migrations, read hundreds of hours worth of DD, learned whatever I could about the world of derivatives especially options and realized how fucked up the Wallstreet was. I am damn well sure hundreds if not thousands of apes will agree the same.  I ainâ€™t selling nor drawing any conclusions from a Burry tweet. At the end of the day GME is the first investment I have studied before buying and will hodl until my thesis go bust</p>
