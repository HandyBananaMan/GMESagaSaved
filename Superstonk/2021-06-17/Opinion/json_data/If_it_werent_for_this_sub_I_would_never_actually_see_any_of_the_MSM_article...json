That sort of stops for me when we continue to post en masse every negative article that surrounds GME. I don't really understand the point? I would understand posting these articles here if you'd like clarification about their content but that doesn't seem to be why most are pushed here.\n\nThere are much better ways to farm fake internet points other than giving the MSM free advertisements on our sub. It feels super unnecessary and it doesn't add any value to promote slanderous content on the sub. Please stop.\n\nLove you all, buy & hodl.",
