It just occurred to me today after hearing the NYSE president say the GME price is not reflected by the demand due to the dark pools, that we're getting GME at a discount at all times. Doesn't matter if it's $140, $280, or $380. It's amazing to think that out there, today, yesterday and tomorrow, there's some guy out there buying GME behind closed doors and selling it all to the good people of retail. Working extra hard to slowly accumulate them and sell as fast as possible, dumping them, almost WASHing outwards of Wall Street's SALEs, WASHing over all of us fortunate retailers engaging in SALEs, WASHing into our hands in the form of a SALE. A modern day Robin Hood. This guy spends countless grueling late nights (![check my weekly Google activity recaps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nu7co6/weekly_recap_of_hedge_fund_hq_activity_new/)) working hard to make sure that every week, after responsibly paying rent and buying dog food, you can afford to buy into a wonderful emerging company. He must'a felt sorry for what he did in January, and now, out of the goodness of his heart, this sweet old, saggy, man is improving our financial situation to his detriment. A true humanitarian, and friend to all, Ken Griffin.
