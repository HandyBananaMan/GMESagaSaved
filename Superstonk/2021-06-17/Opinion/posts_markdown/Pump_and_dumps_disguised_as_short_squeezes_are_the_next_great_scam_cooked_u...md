They’re priming the pump now, using the current real squeeze as the groundwork for their future scam. Once GME squeezes to unimaginable heights there are going to be millions upon millions of dumb money retail investors around the world kicking themselves for missing out. They’ll be desperate to get in on the next one, without realizing that short squeezes were exceedingly rare events even before all the new DTCC rules went into place to make sure one of any significant magnitude never happens again.

What they’ll do is report high short interest in a security that they have complete control over, the media will cover it extensively as bad actors go long with a big enough position that the price starts running. Then the normies will pile in thinking it’s a squeeze. Then the bad actors will dump it at their desired high price point. In retrospect the chart will look like a squeeze actually did occur but really it will have been a pump and dump disguised as a squeeze.
