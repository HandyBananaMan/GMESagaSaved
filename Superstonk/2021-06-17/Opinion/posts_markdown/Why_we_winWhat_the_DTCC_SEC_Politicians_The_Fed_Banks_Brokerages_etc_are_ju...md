# Apes,

# 

# I'm writing this because the sands are shifting.  It doesn't look like it from here but trust me, we just started winning and they are just figuring it out now.  Have you noticed small things like NYSE covertly speaking of Dark Pools/OTCs?  How about people starting to question how these stocks keep popping up every couple of weeks?  How about things like whereis005 and nakedshorts trending on Twitter?  People are starting to ask questions they never had before.....The battle is raging on but there is a shift happening and it's gaining momentum.

&#x200B;

**What??  How?  Don't fuck with me.....You have been patiently HODLing for fucking months.   We win because Apes have something that Hedge Funds don't have and it's the reason we win this war.**

# Hope and Grit

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Regardless, how cheesy you think that sounds, please here me out!  Hope is why you bought into GameStop.  Most of you are here because you have read the DD, you did your own homework,  Apes are all just random individual investors trying to make sense of this mess, and you have HOPE that GME goes to the moon.  MOASS or just the greatest stock turnaround in history, either way, you all have rode waves of FUD, watched your investments drop asshole clenching amounts in a day, Ape migrations across Reddit Subs, dealt with constant doubt, and yet you still held.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Why?**  What on earth would you ever subjugate yourself/family to this level of stress?  **Hope.**   You know the math, you can see through the lies in the MSM, you can ignore the FUD because you know that on the other side of this MOASS could have life changing money.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Most of us here are poor in relative terms compared to the money on Wall Street.  Apes have managed to go toe to toe with those who have trillions at their fingertips.  **None of their normal tactics work and they are losing their minds because at this rate, it's going to expose their crimes. They are looking for a way.....any way they can find, to fuck you and not let the poor's win.  Apes, Ants, Europoors, etc are sharpening their digital pitchforks and are about to topple the long standing system of bleeding wealth from the lower/middle class to benefit the rich if they don't let this MOASS.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Guess what, the poor's/Apes just figured out what is happening.  At some point in all this, Apes are start demanding from these companies who are heavily naked shorted they release a share count.Let's pretend they found some loopholes in this 1st quarter count and were able to keep the number down.   The next proxy vote after a year of pushing retail's buys into Dark Pools and OTC trades; retail will have so many shares, it will break the system.   Let's say they convince GME to hide that information,  **(I'm not encouraging this just simply pointing out the inevitable that you can't keep this hidden forever**) Ape's are going to start disclosing their positions somewhere online or some other forum **(DO NOT POST YOUR POSITIONS OR YOUR STRATEGIES ON REDDIT. Rule 9 of this community states we don't post our positions)** and seeing truly how many shares exist.   The point is, they can't stop the world from seeing how broken this system is and demand a new one.   That means you DTCC.  You will be replaced with something that works.  Where this can't happen again.

&#x200B;

# Grit:   An individual's perseverance of effort combined with the passion for a particular long-term goal or end state (a powerful motivation to achieve an objective) -  Our objective is freeing GameStop from fuckery, fixing a broken system and/or getting rich in the process.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Apes have grit and determination to see this through.  Fuck look at the OBV we aren't going anywhere.  It's the shorts worst nightmare and why we win

# Direct message to the DTCC and Cede.

You should know that Apes are figuring more shit out about the system each day.  Imagine how much more gets unearthed with millions more eyes watching this daily.  You all tried covering up this problem but  it's grown too big.  The Ape's are learning and piecing more things together by the day.  **These naked shorts, that you allowed to happen on your watch are about to make you lose EVERYTHING.**  Each day this continues the problem grows and you get one day closer to having an angry mob of international investors showing up to dismantle your empire brick by brick.   You want to keep your power, you are going to need to sacrifice these shorts to the masses.  Yes, it will cost you boatloads of money after they default but you have already passed some rules to keep this happening again.  If you keep choosing to hide what your bad actors have done, this mob is going to demand the DTCC's head as well.  You allowed this to happen under your roof.   Maybe they decide, that instead of fixing the roof over and over again that somehow keeps leaking;  maybe this mob decide that we need a new house.  Maybe they start electing Ape leaders who will dismantle your system.   Maybe they decide the DTCC needs to go.

# Direct message to the SEC:

&#x200B;

What the fuck are you people doing?  Gary, if your intern or lower level grunt somehow gets this message in front of you.  Hi, you have been on the job over 2 weeks now.  I know you have a lot to fix but fuck man.  You need to light a fire and get rid of the dead weight.  I know it's hard to fire government employees but if they are cozy with the ones breaking the law, fucking get rid of them.  The SEC shouldn't be a jumping board into Wall Street high paying jobs.  You guys are supposed to be the good guys.  You are supposed to be protecting the American/World traders.  Did you guys forget who you serve and protect?   I am a US Marine.  I swore an oath to protect this nation against enemies foreign and domestic.  You all are supposed to be protecting people like us.  The rich get to make the rules.  Demand you all get some fucking teeth.  Jail time for criminals who steal from us little guys.  They laugh at your fines.  Fucking jail these assholes.

# Direct message to Apes.

# I'm writing this in large font for you all.  DO NOT FUCKING BACK DOWN.  We are right, the math shows it and do not let them off the hook.  "They" fucked us in Jan and told us we have to take it.  Guess what, WE DON'T.

&#x200B;

# I've been contacting my congress people, my representatives, writing letters/emails to DTCC, FINRA, SEC.   I buy each and every week as many shares as I can.  I'll continue doing so until people are held responsible and GME's share price is accurately displayed without fuckery.  The problem with having this many moving parts to try to cover up fuckery is there are going to be mistakes.  Hell, the NYSE President just said, "The price is wrong".  Even the MSM is starting to sniff bullshit they are being fed.  It's a matter of time until someone with integrity comes out with a piece.

&#x200B;

# We own the float multiple times over and we are getting more each and every day.  They can't stop this, and they know it.  This isn't us being cocky or dancing.  This is us telling the system we know what you all did and continue to do.....and it's over.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

![For the record, the Ape being held captive is a shill.... lol](https://preview.redd.it/ub2cchsj1u571.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5501e7bc116887d09b89205cf2d5468acab29e3d)

# Hope and Grit =  Why we win

# 

&#x200B;

# TLDR:  First off, do not post your positions on Reddit.  Rule 9 in this community.   The DTCC, SEC, FINRA, SEC, etc are all realizing this problem won't go away and it's growing each day.  The longer they allow this to go on, the bigger the problem is growing.  It's now grown to like fuck up the economy levels.  Hope and Grit are the Apes secret weapons.  We can't be bullied because of our Grit and we hold on so tightly because of Hope.  "They" are realizing they can't fix the problem so they are going to have to figure out damage control at this point.

# EDIT:  This needs to be said.  We are fine to use the terms "We" and "Us" .   I'll point to the disclaimer rules in the sub on the right hand side.  This quote is pulled directly from the disclaimer.

&#x200B;

**Any use of the words "we" or "us" is not evidence of manipulation.** We are not the ones manipulating the market. The use of words that suggest we are a group only references this community of people, who are individuals investing in the same stock, but as individual retail investors. This community is not a place to organize or manipulate markets and it never will be. It is a place for sharing publicly-available information and analyzing/studying that information as a community in a way that benefits everyone fairly and safely.
