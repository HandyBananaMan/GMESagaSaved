# RRP Hits Record High at $755.8 Billion

***That's $200 Billion growth in 24 hours.***

So we broke the previous record by $200B. Overnight. Yay, winning!

**Also... "Liftoff"- JPow Makin it go Brrr Again (banks r fuk)**

&#x200B;

We covered it yesterday, but I've seen lots of conversation around yesterday's Fed press conference. And yes, JPow really said "Liftoff". Tbf, he's talking about inflation, I believe.

[Around the 23m mark is when he says "liftoff"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ0EQHxPZd8)

&#x200B;

[This ape did a partial transcript of the Q&A portion of the Press Conference!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1do4y/transcript_of_jpow_press_conference_16_june_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

***So what does all this mean?***

&#x200B;

# ...I NEED AN ADULT!

&#x200B;

Basically, the Fed decided to increase the interest paid on their ~~junk~~ Treasury Bonds from 0% to 0.05%. So it's more profitable for big banks to park their overflowing cash with the Fed. *Basically, the banks have too much cash so the Fed is giving them more cash- taps brain.*

&#x200B;

The idea here is that taking some of this money out of circulation of the banks will serve to DEFLATE some of the INFLATION concerns. We shall see. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

That was bad information and it was like we originally thought... **005 is in effect, immediately upon filing.**
