<p>Good Morning Everyone!</p>
<p>Sorry for the late start today; I am back guest-guest hosting tonight as our good friend u/Parsnip had his Internet go down! :( Let's pray to the IT gods for his Wi-Fi's safe return.</p>
<p>Prepare your Diamantenhände, <a href="https://redd.it/o0scoy">read some God-tier DD</a>, request your bans and join together to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange as we prepare for the US pre-market to open!</p>
<p>As usual, prices are from <a href="https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie">https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie</a> and are converted in Google. Let's have some fun!</p>

<p>I'm not trying to permanently take over this tradition, just keep it going for fun on days when u/DerGurkenraspler doesn't start the thread at the normal time. They have been unexpectedly absent recently, but I will gladly bow out of this role when they resume updates.</p>
<p>Many have expressed concern for the founder of Diamantenhände. I continue to attempt to contact him, but have not received a reply. However, I have heard from someone who knows our German friend. They have indicated that he is okay, but has some external factors that he needs to focus on.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME! (copied from u/Parsnip)</p>
