<p>Dear Mods, </p>
<p>It has come to my attention the overwhelming flood of Memes that has been emerging in the Hot section of the Sub.</p>
<p>This constitutes a problem in that new Apes and Visitors are instantly shown memes and shitposts, rather than the Quality DD that so many Apes have sacrificed their time and energy to write.</p>
<p>This leads to the second problem.</p>
<p>The flood of shitposts and memes has enable Shills and Karma Farmers to quickly accumulate Karma and continue the loop of memes flooding the sub.</p>
<p>This leads to the third problem:</p>
<p>With enough Karma, Shills are then able to bypass the santori algorithm.</p>
<p>The fourth problem:</p>
<p>The shill takeover of the sub by flooding with memes and drowning out Quality DD.</p>
<p>Please Mods, take this seriously.</p>
<p>Edit: Another Ape has made an analytical assessment on the Shills manipulating the sub
