Dear Mods, 

It has come to my attention the overwhelming flood of Memes that has been emerging in the Hot section of the Sub.

This constitutes a problem in that new Apes and Visitors are instantly shown memes and shitposts, rather than the Quality DD that so many Apes have sacrificed their time and energy to write.

This leads to the second problem.

The flood of shitposts and memes has enable Shills and Karma Farmers to quickly accumulate Karma and continue the loop of memes flooding the sub.

This leads to the third problem:

With enough Karma, Shills are then able to bypass the santori algorithm.

The fourth problem:

The shill takeover of the sub by flooding with memes and drowning out Quality DD.

Please Mods, take this seriously.

Edit: Another Ape has made an analytical assessment on the Shills manipulating the sub
