Just because he happened to capitalize off of the stupidity of others in his field, he is still very much a part of that industry. Remember that in the wild a shark will have no problems eating another shark. \n\nAny sort of significant disruption that GameStop may cause could at least indirectly harm his bottom line. Recognizing this you understand that he is probably not a fan of our cause.\n\nHe may be motivated to discourage us from our Buy and Hodl directive. Keep that in mind as you read his tweets before he deletes them.\n\nPlease stop with the baseless idolization of people even remotely involved with this. It is not healthy for you, and you may find yourself disappointed when they turn out to be not what you thought they were.",
