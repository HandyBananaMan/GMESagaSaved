**TL:DR:** GameStop needs to become a gaming brand that people can connect with. Not a soulless corporate retailer. They can do this by pulling a 100 Thieves and sponsoring content creators. More nitty gritty YouTube technical stuff below.

Edit 1: Holy shit guys, thanks for all the love and support!!

I was checking r/Superstonk this afternoon like I usually do and saw a screenshot of u/brrrrpopop talking about how atrocious GameStop's YouTube channel is and how they could be the next IGN or GameSpot.

He asked someone to write a DD with recommendations to GameStop so I thought I'd rise to the occasion! :D I've been working as an editor / manager for YouTube channels for 5 years now and have been studying it non-stop for years. I worked as a manager for the leading YouTube production company [Render.GG](https://Render.GG) and have worked as a contractor with many other channels. I've seen how powerful YouTube can be when used properly. I can't imagine how well GameStop could utilize YouTube with all the resources at their disposal. Even if they devoted a fraction of their budget to getting this thing off the ground, it could be huge for them. Let's talk about it!

# YouTube Gaming is Already Massive - And It's Growing

In 2020, YouTube Gaming had it's biggest year ever. **100 Billion Hours of gaming content was watched in 2020.** That's TWICE as many hours watched as 2018. Of course, a lot of this had to do with COVID. But this isn't a fluke. The global video game market is expected to hit $204 Billion in 2023 - up 15% from where it is today. YouTube Gaming will keep growing with it. Let's take a look at GameSpot and IGN's YouTube channels and compare them to GameStop's:

GameSpot's YouTube channel has garnered 300,000,000 views in the past year alone. Their channel art is catchy and colorful. The thumbnails are varied and somewhat interesting. (I think GameStop could blow both IGN and GameSpot out of the water but I'll get to that later).

IGN's YouTube channel has garnered 2,200,000,000 views in the past year alone. Their channel art is modern, catchy and **relevant.** 'Summer of Gaming 2021.' Their thumbnails are also fairly interesting. Both GameSpot and IGN probably make millions off of YouTube ad revenue and sponsorships every year. The kicker is **I know GameStop could do way better.** But let's take a look at GameStop's channel in its current state:

What the fuck is this?? This looks like an amateur podcast channel. The banner is lifeless and uninspiring. Their descriptions lack any semblance of decent SEO. The thumbnails are boring as hell. The production quality in these videos is abysmal. In the hyper-competitive environment of YouTube Gaming, this channel doesn't stand a fucking chance as it is. (I love you GameStop and RC, just being honest here). This speaks to a larger problem that GameStop has that I'm going to cover next. . .

# How GameStop Can Blow Both IGN and GameSpot Out of the Water

GameStop still has a huge opportunity to capitalize in areas that IGN and GameSpot aren't. Let me explain.

1. GameSpot and IGN are huge but they're like cold, corporate news outlets. I haven't met, known or heard of a single gamer in my entire life that feels any personal attachment to GameSpot or IGN. In today's business world, consumers want real connection. Everyone is sick and tired of the clinical corporate shit we see every single day. This is where GameStop has the biggest opportunity in my mind. They need to pull a 100 Thieves and become a real gaming brand. Not just a retailer. A BRAND that people can connect with. For starters, they should probably rebrand their YouTube and all their socials with some legitimate design work. Next they should do what 100T did; go sponsor tons of streamers and content creators with existing followings and actually connect with the viewers. Work out partnership deals with those streamers that incentivize their viewers to purchase through GameStop. Create top tier content with those content creators. Have those content creators plug GameStop in their content. Create content with those personalities that's exclusive to the GameStop channel.  Hell, maybe even create fire merch like 100T has done and offer them to viewers. Bottom line, GAMESTOP NEEDS TO BE A GAMING BRAND THAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT. Not a soulless corporate entity.
2. GameStop should start publishing YouTube shorts. Somehow corporations aren't catching onto the fact that YouTube is becoming TikTok and that shorts are EXPLOSIVE. YouTube has introduced a new system called 'YouTube Shorts.' Vertical videos, under a minute long. It seems that YouTube shorts follow a different algorithm than regular YouTube videos. This algorithm is straightforward and hella powerful. If you create shorts that are entertaining and highly watchable, your channel can blow up in a matter of days. I've witnessed multiple Warzone, Minecraft and GTA channels go from 2k views / day to 1, 2, 10 million views per day simply by posting shorts. These channels start with 2k subs and explode basically overnight. Create entertaining shorts that people can enjoy and connect to. Cover as many games as you can and make them relevant / entertaining to even people who don't play that game for max algorithm juice. Publish like 5 of them every day. Shorts are the hack to the YouTube algorithm.
3. Figure out how to actually do SEO or hire someone who ACTUALLY knows YouTube to do it. The SEO on these videos is pathetic.
4. Make better use of your titles and thumbnails. Interesting titles that make people click. Instead of **'Battlefield 4 Epic Play'** something like **'Dice Forgot This in the Battlefield 2042 Trailer ðŸ˜®'** or something like that. The thumbnail should add something to the title and should be well designed! The most common mistake that I see people doing all the time is re-stating the video title in the thumbnail. Come on! The thumbnail is free real estate. You get the title and the thumbnail to make people click. Make good use of them.
5. Find a way to keep up with current YouTube / Gaming trends and capitalize on them. Maybe hire someone who knows the system well.
6. Potentially delete and re-create the GameStop channel. The channel is super dead and dead subs factor HUGELY into the YouTube algorithm.

There are so many more good things they could do with their YouTube channel as far as specific video ideas go - I could go on for AGES. But these are the broad strategic things they need to address first.

# In Conclusion

In conclusion, GameStop is wasting their potential with their YouTube channel. They need to hire people who know YouTube in and out and are up to date with trends. They need to find content creators that they can sponsor and get behind. They need to become a real gaming brand that people can connect with. Just imagine the sales and ad revenue they could generate from a YouTube channel that's getting **2 billion views per year or more** with a loyal dedicated audience.

Thanks for reading! I hope this was helpful and informative to you all. I'm so excited for where the stock is right now. The MOASS has so many good things going for it right now it's crazy. Any day now my friends, any day now! Much love to you all ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ
