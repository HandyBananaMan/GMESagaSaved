     As the title says, how many of you are willing to help anywhere and everywhere you can in the world? The top 1% that hold the most money rarely help and they are just a 1%, when we get filthy rich that 1% may change and finally you can change the world circulate the money, help people and feel better when you put your head to rest at home. 
   
    Personally, I cannot wait to reap the millions of these people so I can repurpose it where it is actually needed. I never understood what a person can do with billions of dollars to their name and not do anything with it. It is enough to feed one person that needs it to make a positive change in just a moment. Stop looking at the price, cause the MOASS will be heard round the world and we would not need to see it in our notifications to know it is happening, just relax everyone we got this.      
     
     Once it is done though, never forget who you were before and do not let the money change you. We cannot be like them, we must be better, help those you can because one small thing you do might inspire others to follow your step and from there on it is a ripple effect of positivity. Example: You build a food shelter, people share you food shelter online, others help in that center( donations of money, food, clothes ), many unfortunate people will be helped and that news will travel fast and far inspiring others to do the same in their communities. 
     
     So, think carefully why you are holding  when those tense moments arrive, do not waver fellow apes. The world needs you, YOU, not the 1% because they have been around for a while and most of them have bought yachts instead of helping. 
     
     I have gotten to know this strong community of smart and very kind people, and I know we can be the change the world needs. I just want you to remember when the time comes, who we were, who we are and who we are going to be at the end of it all. And after all the stuff the opposition pulled on us, they do not deserve any mercy, the floor is enough when the change of wealth happens, it is beyond 20 million. This post might get lost but I hope it has a rippple effect on its own and even if one person gets the positive idea from this, is enough for me. Hold the line fellow apes in arms, the war is long but prosperous.
