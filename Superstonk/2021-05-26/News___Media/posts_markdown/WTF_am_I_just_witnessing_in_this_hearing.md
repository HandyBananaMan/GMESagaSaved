Hearing is cringy as fuck

This hearing is a fucking circle jerking joke. Bank CEOs acting like they are a mix of mother Theresa and Mahatma Gandhi. 

Their bonuses are tied to fucking people over. Banks are as scummy as Hedgefonds any day of the week.

They need to shut the fuck up and stop wanking each other off.

My balls are tingling with cringe. So embarrassing.

GME to the mother fucking MOOOoONNN APES
