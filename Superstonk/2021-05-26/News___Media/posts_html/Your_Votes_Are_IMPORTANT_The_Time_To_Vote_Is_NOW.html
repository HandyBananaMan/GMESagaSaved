<p>Heya Stonkers!</p>
<p>You can <strong>VOTE</strong> with your GameStop shares for the upcoming shareholder meeting on June 9th. The final deadline to vote is June 8th.</p>
<p>It is important that you cast your vote, because this can prove that there ARE more shares floating around than what GameStop has issued. This means that if the amount of votes CAST exceeds the FLOAT. A.K.A <strong>Hedgies. Are. Fuk.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible.</strong></p>

</li>
<li>Say something like “Hello, I am calling because I own a handful of GameStop shares and I am interested in getting my control number that I can use to vote on proxyvote.com regarding the upcoming shareholders meeting”</li>
<li>The rep will likely do one of two things; either transfer you to the proper department for them to give you that info, or they themselves will chat to that department internally to get the control # for you. In my case, the trade desk rep chatted to the department internally and got my control number for me within about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Once you have your control #, it’s off to the races. Visit <a href="http://www.proxyvote.com/">www.proxyvote.com</a>, enter your 16 digit control #, then vote on the list of things. It’s about 5 or 6 things, with recommendations from the board on what they suggest.</li>

<p><strong>Misinformation ALERT:</strong></p>
<p>- The only apes who can vote the DAY OF the shareholders meeting are the ones who PREARRANGED it with GameStop and will be there IN-PERSON. Shills will try to convince you otherwise. All proxy votes MUST BE in by June 8th, or they WILL NOT be counted. Like GameStop, Superstonk encourages all apes to vote as soon as possible.</p>
<p>- Phishing Links from bad actors are being spread around, make sure to input your control number in a website provided by official channels <strong>ONLY. (GameStop Corporate Website OR Links From Your Broker)</strong><br />
----------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>DeadLine To Cast Your Vote: Tuesday, June 8th, 2021</strong></p>
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Voted Flair</strong></p>
<p><strong>(StonkU2):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Want a “🦍Voted✅” Flair? Automod will hook you up! Just type !apevote! And - BOOM - you get a flair, and you get a flair, and YOU get a flair. Everybody Votes? Everybody gets a Flair!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you attempted to vote with no success, 
type: !novote!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please note for all apes who own GME but are feeling left out by the voting flairs... you can now type !newape! and receive your own flair: ✅ New 🦍</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note, this will overwrite any current flair in place. If you already have custom flair, but also want the voted or attempted vote flair, just tag</em> u/Bradduck_Flyntmoore <em>in the comments below!</em><br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<strong>Final Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note that the board recommends you vote for ALL</strong></p>
<p>If you see an ape without the flair, ask them if they have voted, and encourage them to vote!</p>
<p><strong>Ape Help Ape!</strong><br />
