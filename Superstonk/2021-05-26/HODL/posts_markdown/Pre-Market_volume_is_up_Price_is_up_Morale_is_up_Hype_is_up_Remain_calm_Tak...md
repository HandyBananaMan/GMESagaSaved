January Ape here...

This may or may not be the beginning of something significant...

If it is great, if not, I will continue to hold, and buy more when I can...

Expect high amounts of fuckery!

When the price begins to rocket, so does the fuckery. 

Keep calm. Stay strong. Ignore the FUD. Trust your instincts. 

Anything less than $2,000,000 is child’s play anyways. 

Remember every time the price spikes. The attention comes. Be prepared. 

Remember what it was like to hold on those red days, weeks, and months! 

To Valhalla ❤️
