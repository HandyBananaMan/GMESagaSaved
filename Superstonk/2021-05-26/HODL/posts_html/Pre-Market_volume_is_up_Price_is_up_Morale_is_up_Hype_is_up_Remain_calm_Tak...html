<p>January Ape here...</p>
<p>This may or may not be the beginning of something significant...</p>
<p>If it is great, if not, I will continue to hold, and buy more when I can...</p>
<p>Expect high amounts of fuckery!</p>
<p>When the price begins to rocket, so does the fuckery. </p>
<p>Keep calm. Stay strong. Ignore the FUD. Trust your instincts. </p>
<p>Anything less than $2,000,000 is child’s play anyways. </p>
<p>Remember every time the price spikes. The attention comes. Be prepared. </p>
<p>Remember what it was like to hold on those red days, weeks, and months! </p>
<p>To Valhalla ❤️</p>
