REMOVE ALL GODDAMN STOP LOSSES

YOU NEW APES ESPECIALLY, REMOVE THAT SHIT

CRYPTOBROS DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT

OLD APES YOU ALREADY KNOW

REMOVE ALL GODD DAMN STOP LOSSES WE DONT NEED THAT WHERE WE'RE GOING BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO LOSSES WITH GME, ONLY GAINS 

SO TAKE THAT STOP LOSS SHIT AND SHOVE IT THE SSME PLACE THAT UNFORTUNATE BANANA GOT SHOVED

*REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES*

Edit 1: DONT GODDAMN DAY TRADE EITHER YOU MUPPET. YOU TAKE YOUR SHARES SIT IN THE BACK CORNER AND LEAVE THEM THERE AS YOU SHOVE CRAYON AFTER CRAYON UP YOUR NOSE UNTIL YOU PEE AND POOP RAINBOWS YOU SMOOTH BRAINED GLUE SNIFFING ASS FOOL

Edit 2: Not financial advice

Edit 3: thank you all for the awards and all round positive comments! Love this community and everyone in it!!

Edit 4: adding this piece because it seems there's a LOT of new apes (welcome) or just some apes who aren't familiar (it's okay I'm smooth as hell - 100% sure my mum dropped me as a kid a few too many times) that aren't aware of what a stop loss is or how it happens - basically it's a limit sell order that YOU PUT IN at a price that is auto executed IF the price of the share drops to that amount to "prevent further losses". Hedgies can see our stop loss amounts on their end so if it lines up they can hit all those stop losses by shorting the stock to that price and send the price crashing...SO IF YOU RETARDED SHIT NUGGETS HAVE NEVER EVEN LOOKED OR STROKED THAT SELL BUTTON BEFORE YOU'RE SAFE
