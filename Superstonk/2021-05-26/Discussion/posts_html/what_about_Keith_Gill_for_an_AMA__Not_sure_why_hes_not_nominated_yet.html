<p>guys n gals</p>

<p>Like you, I'm trying to follow the AMAs as much as I can. If not for confirmation of our shared bias, than tt learn about WS practice and maybe be able to use that knowledge.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As you and I have learned and know, DFV has single handed proved a theory about how WS operates, and showed to all interested how he (would) execute(d) his plan to counter it, and make bank.</p>
<p>This based on fundamental analysis of Gamestop Co. combined with insight of WS players actions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How come that DFV hasn't been asked (maybe he was but I'm unaware of that) to once more elaborate on his thoughts.</p>
<p>I know you must like the idea as much as I do.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For me, I'd have a question for him:</p>
<p>-  why are you so smart, and am I now smart too because I listened to your advice?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: I know about the (legal) eyes on him at the moment</p>
<p>It's just that MSM is handing out advice and ratings every 5 seconds, so not sure whether that's  a real issue here, discussing market mechanics more broadly</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit 2: I'm under the impression that the folks replying so far seem to have in common to be afraid of Keith having another stage in this process, yet in other wording.</p>
<p>That I'm being downvoted for just answering is fine with me, but please allow me to call you out for shilling, okay?</p>
