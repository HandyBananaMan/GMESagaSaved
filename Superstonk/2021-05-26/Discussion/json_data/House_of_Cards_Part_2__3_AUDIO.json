    "selftext": "I'm one of those apes who needs to listen to the words while they read the words so I am making recordings of u/atobitt's newest additions to the House of Cards trilogy. I figure I'm not the only ape who needs to hear stuff for it to make sense, so I'm sharing my recordings here. Please forgive any flubs and corrections of flubs - I'm reading it all in my head for the first time as I'm reading it all out loud.\n\nThe mp3 for Part 2 is...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe mp3 for Part 3 will be posted first thing in the AM, probably during pre-market. I'll update this post with the link when it's done.\n\nUPDATE: omg APES BROKE DROPBOX. I had no idea this would be this popular. My account's been suspended lol. I'm adding a feed to my libsyn podcast account and posting the links through that. Stay tuned, replacement link will be posted shortly\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDOUBLE UPDATE: This is now officially a podcast. Takes some time for it to show up on all the podcast apps, but in the meantime you can listen directly on libsyn here: [https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com](https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll update again once Part 3 and Part 1 are done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHRUPDATE (that's a portmanteau i just coined for \"third update\"): Part 3 is LIVE: [https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com/house-of-cards-pt-3-by-uatobitt](https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com/house-of-cards-pt-3-by-uatobitt) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe podcast name is SUPERSTONKDDAUDIO bc i'm an Ape and I forgot to use spaces.\n\nSpotify and Apple Podcast feeds are being worked on. Spotify should be live later tonight but Apple usually takes about a week to process a new podcast.\n\nI was so nervous to post the first recording last night - would Apes laugh? would Apes make fun? But I was nervous for naught! Apes support! Apes rejoice!\n\nSo grateful for this community!\n\nI LOVE THIS STONK.",
