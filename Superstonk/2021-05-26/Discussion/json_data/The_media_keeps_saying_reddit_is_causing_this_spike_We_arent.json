    "selftext": "\u201cIt looks like the Reddit Raiders are at it again,\u201d says Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities.  \n\n\nNo, Michael, we are not \"at it\". \n\nWe're not doing anything. We're simply holding and the world is moving to catch up to us.   \n\n\nAnd it's very dishonest to say the cause of this rise is somehow our actions when there is so much DD available to journalists, reporters, traders etc... the \"not financial advice\" opinions and research on reddit is all openly accessible to anyone. There is no subscription required or corporate interest in misleading people (Did you hear the fool who said you should invest in Air Canada over AMC today?) \n\nPainting us as this evil cabal moving the markets at our whim is the most disengenous claptrap  I've ever witnessed.  Everyone is here because they hold the stock and they like the stock. The end.   \n\n\nWe don't have a game plan, there is no we. We don't have billions of dollars and bailouts waiting for us. We don't have control over the markets, able to manipulate buying and selling pressure. \n\nThere is amateur technical analysis and a dude who stuck a banana up his technical analysis. \n\nPersonally, I like the stock.",
