I'm one of those apes who needs to listen to the words while they read the words so I am making recordings of u/atobitt's newest additions to the House of Cards trilogy. I figure I'm not the only ape who needs to hear stuff for it to make sense, so I'm sharing my recordings here. Please forgive any flubs and corrections of flubs - I'm reading it all in my head for the first time as I'm reading it all out loud.

The mp3 for Part 2 is...

&#x200B;

The mp3 for Part 3 will be posted first thing in the AM, probably during pre-market. I'll update this post with the link when it's done.

UPDATE: omg APES BROKE DROPBOX. I had no idea this would be this popular. My account's been suspended lol. I'm adding a feed to my libsyn podcast account and posting the links through that. Stay tuned, replacement link will be posted shortly

&#x200B;

DOUBLE UPDATE: This is now officially a podcast. Takes some time for it to show up on all the podcast apps, but in the meantime you can listen directly on libsyn here: [https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com](https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com)

I'll update again once Part 3 and Part 1 are done.

THRUPDATE (that's a portmanteau i just coined for "third update"): Part 3 is LIVE: [https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com/house-of-cards-pt-3-by-uatobitt](https://superstonkddaudio.libsyn.com/house-of-cards-pt-3-by-uatobitt)

The podcast name is SUPERSTONKDDAUDIO bc i'm an Ape and I forgot to use spaces.

Spotify and Apple Podcast feeds are being worked on. Spotify should be live later tonight but Apple usually takes about a week to process a new podcast.

I was so nervous to post the first recording last night - would Apes laugh? would Apes make fun? But I was nervous for naught! Apes support! Apes rejoice!

So grateful for this community!

I LOVE THIS STONK.
