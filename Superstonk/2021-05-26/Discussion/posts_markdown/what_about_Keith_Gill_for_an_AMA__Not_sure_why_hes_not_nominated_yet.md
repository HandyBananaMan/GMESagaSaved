Like you, I'm trying to follow the AMAs as much as I can. If not for confirmation of our shared bias, than tt learn about WS practice and maybe be able to use that knowledge.

&#x200B;

As you and I have learned and know, DFV has single handed proved a theory about how WS operates, and showed to all interested how he (would) execute(d) his plan to counter it, and make bank.

This based on fundamental analysis of Gamestop Co. combined with insight of WS players actions.

&#x200B;

How come that DFV hasn't been asked (maybe he was but I'm unaware of that) to once more elaborate on his thoughts.

I know you must like the idea as much as I do.

&#x200B;

For me, I'd have a question for him:

\-  why are you so smart, and am I now smart too because I listened to your advice?

&#x200B;

edit: I know about the (legal) eyes on him at the moment

It's just that MSM is handing out advice and ratings every 5 seconds, so not sure whether that's  a real issue here, discussing market mechanics more broadly

&#x200B;

edit 2: I'm under the impression that the folks replying so far seem to have in common to be afraid of Keith having another stage in this process, yet in other wording.

That I'm being downvoted for just answering is fine with me, but please allow me to call you out for shilling, okay?
