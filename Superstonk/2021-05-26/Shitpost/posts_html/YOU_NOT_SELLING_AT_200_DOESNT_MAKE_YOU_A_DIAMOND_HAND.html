<p>STOP PATTING YOURSELVES ON THE BACK FOR NOT SELLING AT 200. IT'S FUCKING PISSING ME OFF. </p>
<p>START CONGRATULATING YOURSELVES WHEN YOU DIDN'T SELL WHEN THE TICKER IS 50,000 OR MORE. THE FLOOR IS 20MIL. THERE IS NOTHING TO FUCKING CELEBRATE YET. </p>
<p>SORRY FOR CAPS. I PROMISE TO NEVER POST AGAIN.</p>
