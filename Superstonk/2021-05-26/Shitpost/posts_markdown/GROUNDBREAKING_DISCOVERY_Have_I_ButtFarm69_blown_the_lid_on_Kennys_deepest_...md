EDIT: u/Tyrant-Tyra has graciously done an excellent [audio recording](https://youtu.be/rxcjnqdThsg) of this post if you would prefer it read aloud!

I want to preface that this research was only possible because of the prior DD's from our wrinkle-brained geniuses who figured out the FTD cycle.  These are some of the apes who deserve your appreciation: [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/) \-- [u/HomeDepotHank69](https://www.reddit.com/u/HomeDepotHank69/) \-- u/Gafgarian \-- [u/1mag1n3\_cgh](https://www.reddit.com/u/1mag1n3_cgh/) \--- [u/Secure-Ad1612](https://www.reddit.com/u/Secure-Ad1612/) \-- [u/Leenixus](https://www.reddit.com/u/Leenixus/) \-- [u/INERTIAAAAAAA](https://www.reddit.com/u/INERTIAAAAAAA/) \-- [u/Suspicious-Singer243](https://www.reddit.com/u/Suspicious-Singer243/) \-- [u/ihatedmyboss](https://www.reddit.com/u/ihatedmyboss/)

In other words, I stand on the shoulders of giants. Now on with the show, and please remember:

# I shit you not, I did this google search to see if there are any macro-societal patterns that relate to 21 and 35 day cycles and this is the first search result that appeared:

[WHAT THE FUCK](https://preview.redd.it/anqb3blv0b171.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=13f893ca8355fecb2c6a1d01833c8546139a2e5f)

# A couple things to unpack here:

# 1.

The menstrual cycle specifically mentions 21 and 35 days! COHENcidence?! I THINK NOT!

THEORY: THE FTDs ARE OVULATING.

Or maybe it's Kenny him(her?)self who is ovulating? Either way, this could POSSIBLY mean that the squeeze could be two to seven days.

OR the other prevailing theory I have is that the MOASS timeline is equivalent to a pregnancy and it will be a gradual upward rise over 9 months and it crowns sometime in the 3rd trimester (that's a word, right? idk I've never had a baby before lol).

From this logic, I have two questions. First, IS Ken pregnant? If yes, WHEN did Ken get pregnant (need wrinkle brains to help me with the insemination date)? And third, what will that baby look like? My theory is that the birth will be bad for Ken and good for us. That explains why Ken keeps trying to push the baby back inside.

# Running with this logic, here is what I think the baby will look like:

Because of this information, we can safely conclude that Kenny is either:

1. A human
2. A primate
3. An elephant
4. A shrew
5. A bat

We can also safely cross off primate/monkey/ape because I think we'd be able to tell if Kenny was one of us. And I read somewhere that elephants don't like mayonnaise. And he is too ugly to be a cute little shrew. So that leaves **human** or **bat**. More on this in a bit...

DISCLAIMER: I am not a MATHEMAGICIAN.

Because we can safely assume that Kenny complains a lot, we can accurately guestimate that his flow is at the upper end with 90mL. And as of my writing this, today's big green dildo volume so far is 11,338,832 shares.

11,338,832 shares divided by 90mL equals 125,987.0237 shares per mL.

That equates to **125.9870237 shares per Liter of mensuration fluid**. More on this in a bit...

Bringing it back to the first image. The top result is from the [MAYO CLINIC](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/menstrual-cycle/art-20047186). MAYO?! Another COHENcidence?! I THINK NOT!

It seems to me that Mayo has slowly been turning against Kenny. Oh how rich is that...his beloved mayonnaise, the [mayo he won't share with others](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n8tvrx/my_friend_had_dinner_with_kenny_g/), is GIVING US THE BREADCRUMBS to his demise! Not only that, but MAYO is comprised of mostly eggs and oil! What happens in an ovulation cycle? The eggs get YEETED from the uterus.

https://preview.redd.it/bfr2021vjh171.jpg?width=1052&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ffdab315eb9e2d1353fdbca83ae086603706440

I CANNOT CONFIRM THIS NEXT PART DUE TO ONLY HAVING CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE...

But I am positing that Ken's yeeted eggs are being used to make his mayo. And it looks like he's running out of eggs. Which means he's running out of his precious mayo. Less eggs equals less mayo and then the cycle gets worse and worse. Which means we are pushing Ken further and further into the corner of desperation. What the fuck is gonna happen when Kenny **RUNS OUT OF MAYO**?!

[BOOM](https://preview.redd.it/y5aeja6mmc171.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f5975d5639f4cd288d9fb3a9347284dcf35f7c)

# SIDENOTE: We should totally make this and everyone can buy it except Ken muhahahaha

# 5. TYING EVERYTHING TOGETHER; THE THEORY OF THE MENSTRUATING TRIANGLE OF CARDS - PARTS 1 thru 69.

There are some possible conclusions that I have drawn up, but I am open for more interpretations. After all, the power of this group comes from our ability to crowdsource and crowdverify! So please feel free to chime in so together we can find the \~TRUTH\~.

# a. Kenny is actually a human woman (loosely)

and the FTD's are actually her ovulation cycle. The bigger the flow, the greener we go (looks like Kenny's bleeding hard right now). I'm not a big fan of this theory because that would mean that Ken pulled a Mulan and I don't think he's cool or badass enough to do that. So moving on...

# b. Kenny is a man with EXTREME MOMMY ISSUES.

Oh NOW we're cooking! I'm talking "Homelander sucking on teet" level mommy issues. KENNY might not be the one ovulating, but *maybe* he has a weird **obsession** with menstruation and he is synced up with someone in particular?

[Kenny: \\"ooohhh yea baby, breast milk mmmmm all for me gulp gulp ahhhh\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ivi225h32b171.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c1ec57879aff1dfce02af33dbbfe523794ccf1)

In college, I lived with 2 female roommates for a year and I'm pretty sure my moods synced up with their cycles at some point, so this theory is not out of the question. Right now I have no definitive evidence towards the identity of this unknown human female. Is it his ex-wife? Or mother? An old flame? I don't know, so I would love the group to help me discover this missing link.

# c. Kenny is a vampire.

You fucking read that correctly.

Before I dive into this theory in full, I need to bring [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-20/citadel-securities-agrees-to-97-million-settlement-in-china) to your attention.

[Headline of the article](https://preview.redd.it/zrcmwyilrc171.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=f059c7b5f0303a0c1c33c9f9fbf3438c9668b322)

Snippet of Article: "Citadel Securities LLC agreed to pay a 670 million-yuan ($97 million) settlement for alleged trading irregularities during the 2015 market rout in China."

So we know for sure that Kenny has been doing business in China for a while. And we know he's been fucking up more than just the American markets with his shady business dealings and China fined him for it.

Now, remember when we learned that Kenny is either human or a bat (see Point 2). Well if we run with the "he's a bat" theory and also couple in the fact that he's a blood sucking leech (the hedgies killed Toys r Us and many other companies), then I think we can safely conclude that it's entirely possible he's also a vampire.

This would also explain the fascination with the menstruation cycle. Sorry to gross you out, but what if this was also his *feeding schedule* ðŸ¤®? Vampires need blood from somewhere, right? It all fucking connects.

But wait, there's more! We've got Kenny is a bat, and China doesn't like Kenny. Kenny doesn't seem like a person who takes a spanking without spanking back. Which leads me to this:

Wasn't there some huge worldwide event that happened because of a bat and was related to China? Hmmmm I can't put my finger on it. OH WAIT!

[https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/01\/08\/health\/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html](https://preview.redd.it/gk95xmtctc171.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e07eff6de420e95120b77fde08c29cbc86bf5f)

Looks sus to me. Where the fuck was Ken in January 2020? Well I'm not exactly sure, but I know where he WASN'T.

[Washington Post: Trump signs â€˜phase oneâ€™ of trade deal with China as House moves on impeachment](https://youtu.be/3eUXZ_LLhfo?t=1711)

This is a video of then President Trump signing the phase one trade deal with China. Ken was one of the individuals who was thanked during the ceremony. But he wasn't there when Trump called his name. Trump even remarked, "Where the hell is he--he's trying to hide some of his money...where the hell is Ken?"

So if Ken wasn't where he was supposed to be, then where WAS he?

# 6. THE WILDLY INCONCLUSIVE CONCLUSION:

Ken was in China concocting the Coronavirus. Because China hit him with the fines, he wanted payback. So he created COVID-19 in a lab and injected himself and then fucked some bats while he was in his bat form. I feel bad for those bats because they probs thought it was going to be a long-term relationship, but they got played and ghosted by Kenny. Obviously this had to start in 2019, but we know for sure he wasn't with Trump on January 15, 2020. So we can't rule out that he WASN'T in CHINA when it all went down, ya feel?

I don't know if he planned for it to become a whole worldwide pandemic, but that doesn't absolve him. Or maybe he did it all knowingly. Who knows?! Either way, his plan for world domination failed and now we are hitting back with a vengeance just like [this watermelon to the face](https://youtu.be/8cfeTZNcA3g?t=18):

[BOOM! RIGHT IN THE KISSER!](https://i.redd.it/3va17kzk9c171.gif)

# 7. ONE LAST CONNECTION...

...and it's a fucking doozy. Remember how Citadel's fine to China was 670 million yuan?

And then remember that 125.9870237 shares per Liter of menstrual fluid?

If we divide 670,000,000 by 125.9870237, we get 5,318,008.

I know you feel like a wet tampon right with all the info you've absorbed. Trust me, I feel it too. Between this discovery, GME pushing 250, and the ass banana, I haven't been able to sleep soundly. This is the biggest case I've ever worked on and it's my journalistic duty (lol) to bring you the hard hitting scoop. Where we go from here is up to the community to decide.

The obvious plan of action is to find his weaknesses and exploit them. His crux could be his mother like in the Halloween movie series. Or maybe it's the mayonnaise and we would need to contact Hellman's. Or maybe it's the vampire, which we would need sunlight or some steaks right to his heart...
