According to his numbers, in most cases the short interest is 50% - 150% **MORE** than what is reported by the SEC *(starting at 14:30).* \n\nThe objective isn\u2019t to address the issue: it\u2019s to keep the issue hidden. Firms that underreport their short interest are gaming the system by taking advantage of how the short interest calculation is done. When the SEC relies on reports that broker-dealers provide, and FINRA takes YEARS to reveal the lies within those reports, the broker-dealer can lie without immediately facing the consequences. It allows these firms to operate in a high-risk environment without exposing just HOW big their risk-appetite is.\n\nAnother example that Wes mentioned was [Merrill Lynch](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-128.html). Merrill was fined [$415,000,000](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_16139.pdf) *(violation 3)* in 2016 for using securities held in their customer\u2019s accounts to cover their own trades. Check out this screenshot I took from that case:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9625j8wek171.jpg?width=1115&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85d43bc351fbda75e347bd33a1a550b67dda970e\n\nRemember when we mentioned [SEA 15c3-3](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/SEA.Rule_.15c3-3.pdf) in the case with Apex? They were asking customers to book short positions to either a cash account or a short margin account. [SEA 15c3-3](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/SEA.Rule_.15c3-3.pdf) protects those customers from allowing brokers to lend out the securities within their cash accounts\u2026\n\nWell Merrill Lynch knocked that one right out of the f\\*cking park\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3zok5wyek171.jpg?width=1129&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=815e5344912234ceba846dc0d45c8b8b488b82c4\n\nMerrill made it seem like the required deposit in their customer reserve account was much lower than it truly was. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to use that cash if it reduced the amount below the minimum capital requirement, so they found a way to fudge the numbers. In doing so, they managed to prevent a CODE RED while reaping the benefits of a high-risk \u2018opportunity\u2019. Should Merrill have filed bankruptcy during that time, those customers would have been completely blindsided. \n\nIn the case of short selling, the *true* exposure of short interest is unknown\u2026 and I\u2019m not just talking about the short sale indicator. When a firm fails to deliver securities that were sold short, there\u2019s a pretty good indication that they\u2019ve exposed themselves to a bit of a problem.. Now imagine a case where the FTDs start piling up and they STILL continue to short sell that same security.. think I\u2019m joking?\n\nCheck out the [Royal Bank of Canada](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_31194.pdf):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6yl6tj2fk171.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e44cc507247db1e28c00a213f90054b9abdaa6a\n\nAgain\u2026 I was pretty shocked at that one. However, nothing rang-the-bell quite like this one from [Goldman Sachs](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_361.pdf):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5f408er6fk171.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=38b9ad83d2a07360af5b5cd99d834a8771b66c93\n\nGoldman had 68 occasions in 4 months where they didn\u2019t close a failure-to-deliver\u2026 In 45 occasions, they CONTINUED to accept customer short sale orders in securities which it had an active failure-to-deliver\u2026\n\nWhen a firm is really starting to sweat, they pull certain tricks out of their ass to quell the situation. Again, this is nothing but smoke and mirrors because that\u2019s all they can really do. Just as Merrill Lynch artificially lowered their customer reserve deposit, other firms make it look like they cover their short positions.\n\nOne of the ways they do this is by short selling a SH\\*T load of shares right before a buy-in\u2026 Since we\u2019re talking about Goldman Sachs, this seems like a great time to showcase their experience with this..\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhf1hr1afk171.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=f704c3722ae287480057ce3e01c561a28b77cf4c\n\nI promise\u2026 It really is as dumb as it sounds\u2026\n\nSo the perception here is when Goldman\u2019s client has a FTD and they find out a buy-in is coming, the required buy-in would obviously be too extreme for the client to handle.. So they begin to buy those shares while simultaneously shorting AT LEAST the same amount they were required to purchase\u2026\n\nHave you ever failed to repay a loan so you went to another bank and got a loan to cover the first one? Well that\u2019s exactly what this is\u2026 I know what you\u2019re probably thinking\u2026 \u201cdidn\u2019t that just kick the can down the road?\u201d. The answer is YES: it didn\u2019t actually solve anything..\n\nThere\u2019s still one more citation that Goldman received which truly represents the pinnacle of *no-sh\\*ts-given.* After I cover this, I don\u2019t know how anyone could argue the systematic risks that exist within the securities lending business.. Check it out:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0md200bdfk171.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf5e8310fbcbd73699e3593b2ab5dab418055ab0\n\nFor 5 years, Goldman relied on a team of 10-12 individuals to locate shares to be used by its clients for short selling. This group was known as the \u201cdemand team\u201d. Naturally, as the number of requests coming in the door started to increase, it became difficult for the team to properly document all of them. The volume peaked at 20,000 requests PER DAY, but the number of individuals that handled this job stayed the same. \n\nObviously, this became too much for them to handle so they opted out of the manual process and found another solution- the F3 key\u2026.\n\nYes- the F3 key\u2026 This button activated an autofill system which completed **98% of Goldman\u2019s orders to locate shares**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exqzge3gfk171.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9c8b740974dad01db69460332c56df81a8d768\n\nThe problem with Goldman\u2019s autofill system was that it used the number of shares available to borrow at the beginning of that day, which had already been accounted for. After using the auto-locate feature, the demand team didn\u2019t even verify the accuracy of the autofill feature or document which method was used to locate the shares for each order\u2026 and this happened for 5 years..\n\nJust goes to show how dedicated firms like Goldman Sachs truly are to the smallest of details, you know? Great f\\*cking work, guys.\n\nBy the way, I have to show one of Goldman\u2019s short sale indicator violations\u2026 It\u2019s too good to pass up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5iuhlkcjfk171.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e2fa1f106e78b9d282b60c3cee9944e919ea82\n\nAt some point, you just have to laugh at these ass clowns\u2026 I mean seriously\u2026 one violation for a 4 year period involving over 380,000,000 short interest positions\u2026 they have plenty of other short interest violations, I just laughed at how the magnitude of this one was summarized by FINRA with 10 lines and roughly 4 minutes... whoever wrote that one must have been late for lunch.. \n\nThe last thing I\u2019d like to note here is the way in which short sellers use options to \u201ccover\u201d their positions. Wes gave a great overview of this in the AMA *(starting at 6:25)*. Basically, one group will buy puts and another group buys calls. This creates a synthetic share that is only provided if the option is activated. Regardless, short sellers will use that synthetic share to cover their short position and the regulators actually accept it\u2026 \n\nHowever, as Wes points out, most of those options expire without being activated which means the share is never delivered. This expiration can be set months down the road and allows the short seller to keep kicking the can.\n\nI doubt I need to say this, but we all remember the wild options activity that was happening shortly after GameStop spiked in January. u/HeyItsPixel was one of the first to point this out. While a lot of that activity was on the retail front, I suspect a lot of it was done by short sellers to cover those positions.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**5.** **Hedgies are f\\*cked\u2026**\n\nI\u2019m officially +20 pages deep and there\u2019s still so much I\u2019d like to say. It\u2019s best saved for another time and another post, I suppose. So I guess I\u2019ll wrap all of this up with some of the best news I can possibly provide\u2026\n\nIt all started with a [73 page PDF](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) that was published in 2005 by a silverback named John D. Finnerty.\n\nJohn was a Professor of Finance at Fordham University when he published *\u201cshort selling, death spiral convertibles, and the profitability of stock manipulation\u201d*. The document is loaded with sh\\*t that\u2019s incredibly relevant today, especially when it comes to naked short selling. He dives into the exact formula that short sellers use, which is far beyond what my wrinkled brain can interpret, alone\u2026\n\n..However, when firms are naked shorting a company with the goal of bankrupting them, they leave footprints which are only explained by this event. The proof is in the pudding, so to speak..\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ax7u0r4wfk171.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1828755bfe49c47ca178d960f91dfd21d8b0d680\n\nAny of this sound familiar?? \n\n*\u201cThe manipulator can not drive the share price close to zero unless he can naked short an extraordinary number of shares\u2026* *this form of manipulation would result in\u2026 unusually heavy trading volume, and unusually large and persistent fails to deliver at the NSCC\u201d.*\n\nAnyone else remember the volume in GME during the run-up in January? The total volume traded between **1/31/2021 and 2/5/2021 was 1,508,793,439** **shares**, or an average daily trade volume of **88,752,555 shares.** On 1/22/2021, the volume reached 197,157,946\u2026 that\u2019s roughly 3x the number of shares that exist.. \n\nif this doesn\u2019t sound like unusual volume then I\u2019m not sure what is. Furthermore, the FTD report on GameStop was through the roof during this time:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brz98nbzfk171.jpg?width=1625&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83ae877853acd2ec65fa73f57216f00b708a7eab\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlla3ak0gk171.jpg?width=1038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5d4a1331f8c9d97b5338cc55a37310a95c9559b\n\n  \n\nNotice the statement where the manipulator will be relieved of its obligation to cover **IF** the firm\u2019s shares are cancelled in bankruptcy? Did you happen to see footnotes 65 & 66 in the first screenshot of his PDF? It references a company that he used for his analysis\u2026 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdp3at43gk171.jpg?width=997&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8508c9d0c869544f0ccd3a15477abfd64d38897c\n\nCharter Communications had a whopping **241.8% short float in 2005**\u2026 **The ONLY way the manipulator could have escaped this was by bankrupting the company and relieving the obligation to repurchase those shares\u2026**\n\nGuess what happened to Charter? They filed for [bankruptcy](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7189668&page=1) in 2009\u2026\n\nHowever, unlike John\u2019s example where naked short sellers were driving down the price without opposition, GameStop had extremely high demand from retail investors to counter this activity. As I have discussed with Dr. T and Carl Hagberg, the run-up in volume during January and February was largely conducted by naked short sellers in an attempt to suppress the share price. As I have shown in the example with Goldman Sachs, firms will short sell during a buy-in for the same exact reason. To stabilize the price, you must stabilize supply and demand. \n\n\u2026You know what Charter didn\u2019t have? \n\nAN ARMY OF APES TO HODL THE STONK\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDIAMOND. F\\*CKING. HANDS",
