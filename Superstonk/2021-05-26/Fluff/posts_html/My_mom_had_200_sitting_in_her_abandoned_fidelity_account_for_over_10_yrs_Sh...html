<h1>Title: My mom had ~200$ sitting in her abandoned fidelity account for over 10 yrs. She just recovered it about a month ago and saw that it grew to 15k. Dad tried to convince her to put it in crypto, but I convinced her to yolo it into GME. Ive been teaching her the way of the ape, and she is a natural!</h1>
