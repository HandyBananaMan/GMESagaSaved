<p>Good Morning San Diago,</p>
<p>I am Rensole and this is your daily news.</p>
<p>Does anyone smell that?</p>
<p>*insert flashy intro card*</p>

<p>Ok this one is a little obligatory</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Happy 200, glad to see you again my old friend.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But let's go with the news</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/x1dadtwpkf171.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2590f499ef55702360c92afd0d44dce09df53982</p>
<h1>Cramer and Bear Stearns</h1>
<p>So everyone has seen the big short by now right?</p>
<p>At the ending of the movie you can see Mark Baum at a conference and a guy talking about how his bank is still ok, while the rest of the room is getting updates on their phones that the stock is plummeting, this is what happened with Bear Stearns and Jimmy Cramer.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns was one of the biggest banks in terms of stock brokering in the world at the time. and Jim Cramer told others to "buy buy buy" as he so often does with his soundboard. the problem however was that at the time BS was trading around $62 usd, only five days later they got bought out by Jp Morgan for $2 usd a share. (bailed out by them).</p>
<p>Now from this came a joke of sorts, always do the opposite of what Cramer says (even long before we apes came along), sometimes he has a good thing in there and some actual good advice but more then not I'd say the inverse is true.</p>
<p>Now Jim Cramer has a great background as a hedgefund manager and entertainment personality, both come with great connections to the right people, so you'd think he would know whatsup and give better advice than most people could as just a tv personality, but here we are again, another "Bear Stearns is FINE" moment, there have been people screaming about the inflation of the USA going insanely high (prices of food, lumber and metals going up) and JPOW is screaming "nah it's all ok"</p>
<p>I'm hardly an expert or someone who is allowed to use scissors without supervision, but by all the markers it seems that the USA economy is circling the drain right now, with reverse repo rates getting higher by the day, inflation rising, CBOE VIX spiking every other day, M1 surging....</p>
<p>Yeah this feels like another "Bear Stearns" situation to me.</p>

<h1>For the new apes among us</h1>
<p>First of all welcome!</p>
<p>Second, for the people who see this and think "Woah dude" be sure to chill and read some DD we have posted around here, while going up over 200 is nice we are up institutional gamblers *cough Shitadel*</p>
<p>These guys will do everything to win so they wont go "fuck it, they've won" they'll fight till the last nickel is done for, so even though its awesome to see, don't think you've won until it's way over.</p>
<p>Again read the DD, take in as much info as you can, and double check everything, never trust anyones word, always do your own DD.</p>
<p>Knowledge is the weapon against all FUD</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<h1>IS IT A BIRD? IS IT A PLANE?</h1>
<p>I will be adding a big part on the NFT and blockchain stuff here later today be sure to come back and check it (I'd rather take my time to double check everything and the possibilities with it before making claims that may be wrong).</p>
<p>The big news comes down to something fucking awesome</p>
<ul>
<li>First Actual use of the NFT to use as a service or goods</li>
<li>NFT based preorder items</li>
<li>Perhaps a crypto dividend</li>
<li>Power up rewards can become part of the blockchain</li>
<li>reselling of digital games</li>
<li>Digital marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these are going to be implemented, congrats RC you've just killed off Steam</p>
<p>But again I'll be diving deeper into the entire crypto part and will be coming back here later today to update it with as much info as I can find.</p>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>

<h1>Gamestop Cryptoshop</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ok I have to preface this that my crypto knowledge is extremely limited, and I will have to go off of information of smarter apes which have posted here, so if anything is incorrect in this next segment please feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>Now first of some things we know for sure (or think we know for sure).</p>
<p>the address where you can find the info is <a href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">https://nft.gamestop.com/</a></p>
<p>There is a small game hidden in there, with the squeezable cat toy, its the little pixel on the top right of the website if you click that you get the game.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The token was created around the time of Ryan Cohens tweet</p>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e">https://etherscan.io/token/0x13374200c29C757FDCc72F15Da98fb94f286d71e</a></p>
<p>\^ address with all info and age.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Do not buy any Crypto's because people say "this is Gamestops Crypto" When GME will launch their crypto for to be able to buy, expect Gamestop to offer some sort of press statement, the crypto landscape is littered with scammers so be very careful please.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The platform they are using is Etherium and some information about that can be found here:</p>

<p>The GME crypto will launch on July 14th, Bastille day.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>This was found by  u/jakksquat7 in his thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nl2vld/july_14th_the_date_of_the_gme_crypto_coin_launch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another thing we know for sure is that this does not automatically mean there will be a crypto dividend, but the possibility of one just rose exponentially. As GME themselves have not made a public statement about this we don't know for sure if it will happen, but again it seems like the chances just rose exponentially.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/v5gpt5gqag171.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e00366b5333b2d6bfb5dd45317b0338fd311f3</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>NFT's have not been used for "useful" transfers, meaning up until now you could buy digital artwork, or a videoclip. With Gamestop getting into the NFT business we might see the first implementation of "useful NFT".</p>
<p>With useful I don't mean to say the previous stuff wasn't, but useful is more defined in the sense of something you can actually use as a product.</p>
<p>This can be implemented in lots of different ways as I've come to understand it, as with the blockchain you can get verified data. meaning one could in theory use it to sell and resell digital assets.</p>
<p>So they could in theory make a "Steam" like store, but with the option of selling your digital games, or selling cosmetic items (players of Warzone/Fortnite/CSGO and others may be familiar with this and know that custom skins can sometimes go for big money), also as I understand it is that the original creator gets a cut of the profits if it gets resold.</p>
<p>The old model was:<br />
Player buys physical model in store<br />
80% of the profit is for the store, 10% for the publisher 10% for the creator (just an example), but once the game got traded in and resold the profit was 100% for the store selling this game.</p>
<p>Now in the digital marketplace we see people like Valve and Apple having a monopoly (their cut is usually around 30ish %) but there is only one sell and it's done</p>
<p>With the new model it could be possible a player plays a game, is done with it and wants to sell it, now lets say it gets sold on GME's marketplace as an NFT, the original creator/publisher of the game will get a cut of each sale on the secondhand digital market, this incentivises them to participate as it creates a secondary (passive) income stream for them.</p>
<p>Also you could have more weight behind digital versions of "collectors editions" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The same could also be used for "save files",  in game currency, specific partnerships (for example twitch or SLGG or Microsoft) to make an easy method to pay across all platforms with a simple click of a button, and GameStop as a company can earn a passive income stream from "transaction fees" (for example 1 cent per sale, if you have thousands a day that still racks up a nice sum).</p>
<p>The same could also be used for actual physical items, they could combine their powerup rewards program with this, or Pre ordering, curbing scalpers (seeing they sell both consoles and graphics cards now who knows?)</p>
<p>This could nullify the Piracy argument and need for bad antipiracy locks ( LOOKING AT YOU DENUVO DRM), because the item could be verified via nft blockchain.</p>
<p>Cross platform games or cross platform avatars, as in theory (as far as I understand) your entire gamer profile could be an NFT</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Regardless of what Gamestop decides to use their NFT technology for, I am thrilled to just even think about all the possibilities that this technology brings with it. and as someone who has never really dabbled with crypto that much, this is exciting to see crypto come very close to physical stores.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again boilerplate not financial advice and I know jack shit about crypto, but I like this stock and I'm excited to see the future </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
