<h1>Edit: Debunked! Big sad. The posts of glitches were only around T+21 dates so that thew me for a loop. They happen frequently and in other stocks too. I'm not a TOS user so I followed a red herring only to get suplexed by /u/jsmar18</h1>
<p>Gonna make this quick since I'm hype AF, want to get my thoughts out, and to get more apes to discuss.</p>

<h1>0. Volume Glitches Close To T+21 Days</h1>
<p>Let's get right to it. We've been seeing glitches once in a while of volume on the buy side. They've always confused me and STILL confuse me, but maybe it's finally coming together.</p>
<p>We saw a "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkyxt4/the_gme_glitch_of_63_million_shares_on_may/">glitch</a>" yesterday in buy order volume. A glitch of \~63M:</p>

<p>And this isn't the first time it's happened. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbs1kb/so_theres_a_643m_order_sitting_on_tos_right_now/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">We also saw a "glitch" on March 23</a>. A buy order volume glitch of \~634M:</p>

<p>Notice something.... interesting about the dates? Those are all <strong>very close to T+21 dates</strong>. For a refresh, here's the T+21 days that have happened in 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li>January 25</li>
<li>February 24 (Glitch on February 22)</li>
<li>March 25 (Glitch on March 23)</li>
<li>April 26</li>
<li>May 25</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok cool, we have buy order volume glitches. What could they possibly mean?</p>
<h1>1. FINRA Trade Report Processing Rule</h1>
<p>Our fellow ape /u/afterberner9000 found <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/7140">a FINRA rule</a> which could explain why we're seeing things ramp up. Why we might now be experiencing T+21 a day later on T+22. Here's a link to their comment:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the_dd_has_once_again_proven_to_be_true/gzfa2o5/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the_dd_has_once_again_proven_to_be_true/gzfa2o5/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>Edit: The rule is still important to note. But disregard the speculation regarding these glitches.</p>
<p>~~Essentially, their trade will become 'locked in' (forced) <strong>if it remains open by 2:30PM</strong>. So what does this mean?~~</p>
<p>~~<strong>(Speculation coming</strong>) Need more apes to discuss.~~</p>
<ol>
<li>~~<strong>Zoom back to February 22nd.</strong> They get a glitch of 94M <strong>at the end of the day,</strong> meaning the order is actually for February 23rd.~~</li>
<li>~~By 2:30PM February 23rd, they need to close that order or it gets locked in. They <strong>need to can-kick this order or it will be forced the next day (Feb 24th)</strong>.~~</li>
<li>~~They can-kicked as much as possible but didn't close the entire order of 94M. 2:30PM February 23rd hits, and their buy order is locked-in for the next day, February 24th.~~</li>
<li>~~February 24th hits and the remainder of the buy order goes through - resulting in a huge spike in price.~~</li>
</ol>
<p>~~Apply this now to March 23rd glitch. They can-kicked tons of that volume order by March 24th. And then, March 25th surge happened. What could this mean for the glitch we just saw? <strong>Well, if the theory is right and the rule applies here, then they need to can-kick a 63M buy order by EOD May 26th (today) or let it go through.</strong>~~</p>
<h1>2. Volume Glitches = Portion of SI%?</h1>
<p>Edit: The glitches cannot be used to calculate SI% or anything significant. This is a common glitch on TOS as pointed out by our other fellow apes. (They should fix that lol)</p>
<p>~~If these are truly buy orders of their can-kicking, then Jesus Christ, what the hell did they do?! I'll provide you with some crazy numbers.~~</p>
<p>~~We don't know how much their SI% is, but these glitches might be a big, big hint.~~</p>
<p>~~The orders are very spread out, so they could be overlapping here and not be cumulative. So for the sake of this post, we'll assume the <strong>634M</strong> volume order on March 23rd is what they're can-kicking off of their balance sheet. <strong>This doesn't even include their current short position.</strong> But let's say that it is the currently reported 20% SI% plus the 634M order. Know how much SI% just that gives us?~~</p>
<p>~~20% SI @ 55m float = 11M~~</p>
<p>~~11M + 634M = 645M~~</p>
<p>~~645M / 55M float = 11.72~~</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>~~SI% From March 23 Glitch: 1,172%~~</p>
<p>~~Oh boy.~~</p>
<p>~~But wait, there's more!~~</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>~~There was another glitch on March 25. Either this is what they are can-kicking, or this throws the entire theory out the window. Because it is a terrifyingly large number and might not even account for overlap of can-kicking. If this is what they're can-kicking, then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdcy3x/185_billion_buy_volume_18375_still_showing_in/">what the hell is this "glitch" on March 25</a>?~~</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/yvcqcc8k6h171.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0765d8bd6a96dc100292e05e5aefcdb090c87a7">March 25 Volume Glitch</a></p>
<p>~~Yeah, that's 1.85 BILLION. <strong>If</strong> these orders are their true short positions that are being suppressed, then that comes out to be..~~</p>
<p>~~SI% From March 25 Glitch: 3,383%~~</p>
<p>~~These guys are going to break the damn stock market if this is true.~~</p>
