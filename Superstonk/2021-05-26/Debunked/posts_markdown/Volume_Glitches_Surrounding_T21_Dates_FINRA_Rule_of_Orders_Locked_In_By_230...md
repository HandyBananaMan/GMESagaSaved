# Edit: Debunked! Big sad. The posts of glitches were only around T+21 dates so that thew me for a loop. They happen frequently and in other stocks too. I'm not a TOS user so I followed a red herring only to get suplexed by /u/jsmar18

Gonna make this quick since I'm hype AF, want to get my thoughts out, and to get more apes to discuss.

Once again - I am not a financial advisor and I am not providing you financial advice.

# 0. Volume Glitches Close To T+21 Days

Let's get right to it. We've been seeing glitches once in a while of volume on the buy side. They've always confused me and STILL confuse me, but maybe it's finally coming together.

We saw a "[glitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkyxt4/the_gme_glitch_of_63_million_shares_on_may/)" yesterday in buy order volume. A glitch of \~63M:

And this isn't the first time it's happened. [We also saw a "glitch" on March 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbs1kb/so_theres_a_643m_order_sitting_on_tos_right_now/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). A buy order volume glitch of \~634M:

[And another "glitch" on February 22nd.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lq0lwu/why_is_there_a_94_million_share_buy_order_in_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) A buy order volume glitch of \~94M:

Notice something.... interesting about the dates? Those are all **very close to T+21 dates**. For a refresh, here's the T+21 days that have happened in 2021:

* January 25
* February 24 (Glitch on February 22)
* March 25 (Glitch on March 23)
* April 26
* May 25

Ok cool, we have buy order volume glitches. What could they possibly mean?

# 1. FINRA Trade Report Processing Rule

Our fellow ape /u/afterberner9000 found [a FINRA rule](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/7140) which could explain why we're seeing things ramp up. Why we might now be experiencing T+21 a day later on T+22. Here's a link to their comment:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the\_dd\_has\_once\_again\_proven\_to\_be\_true/gzfa2o5/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nkwhq3/the_dd_has_once_again_proven_to_be_true/gzfa2o5/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)

Edit: The rule is still important to note. But disregard the speculation regarding these glitches.

~~Essentially, their trade will become 'locked in' (forced) **if it remains open by 2:30PM**. So what does this mean?~~

~~**(Speculation coming**) Need more apes to discuss.~~

1. ~~**Zoom back to February 22nd.** They get a glitch of 94M **at the end of the day,** meaning the order is actually for February 23rd.~~
2. ~~By 2:30PM February 23rd, they need to close that order or it gets locked in. They **need to can-kick this order or it will be forced the next day (Feb 24th)**.~~
3. ~~They can-kicked as much as possible but didn't close the entire order of 94M. 2:30PM February 23rd hits, and their buy order is locked-in for the next day, February 24th.~~
4. ~~February 24th hits and the remainder of the buy order goes through - resulting in a huge spike in price.~~

~~Apply this now to March 23rd glitch. They can-kicked tons of that volume order by March 24th. And then, March 25th surge happened. What could this mean for the glitch we just saw? **Well, if the theory is right and the rule applies here, then they need to can-kick a 63M buy order by EOD May 26th (today) or let it go through.**~~

# 2. Volume Glitches = Portion of SI%?

Edit: The glitches cannot be used to calculate SI% or anything significant. This is a common glitch on TOS as pointed out by our other fellow apes. (They should fix that lol)

~~If these are truly buy orders of their can-kicking, then Jesus Christ, what the hell did they do?! I'll provide you with some crazy numbers.~~

~~We don't know how much their SI% is, but these glitches might be a big, big hint.~~

~~The orders are very spread out, so they could be overlapping here and not be cumulative. So for the sake of this post, we'll assume the **634M** volume order on March 23rd is what they're can-kicking off of their balance sheet. **This doesn't even include their current short position.** But let's say that it is the currently reported 20% SI% plus the 634M order. Know how much SI% just that gives us?~~

~~20% SI @ 55m float = 11M~~

~~11M + 634M = 645M~~

~~645M / 55M float = 11.72~~

&#x200B;

~~SI% From March 23 Glitch: 1,172%~~


~~Oh boy.~~

~~But wait, there's more!~~

&#x200B;

~~There was another glitch on March 25. Either this is what they are can-kicking, or this throws the entire theory out the window. Because it is a terrifyingly large number and might not even account for overlap of can-kicking. If this is what they're can-kicking, then [what the hell is this "glitch" on March 25](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdcy3x/185_billion_buy_volume_18375_still_showing_in/)?~~

![March 25 Volume Glitch](https://preview.redd.it/yvcqcc8k6h171.png?width=1879&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0765d8bd6a96dc100292e05e5aefcdb090c87a7)

~~Yeah, that's 1.85 BILLION. **If** these orders are their true short positions that are being suppressed, then that comes out to be..~~

~~SI% From March 25 Glitch: 3,383%~~



~~These guys are going to break the damn stock market if this is true.~~
