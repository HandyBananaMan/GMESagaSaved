    "selftext": "In SR-PHLX-2021-30 it is updating this rule\n\n>**Section 7. In-Kind Exchange of Options Positions and ETF Shares**  \n>  \n>Positions in options listed on the Exchange may be transferred off the Exchange by a member or member organization in connection with transactions to purchase or redeem creation units of ETF shares between an authorized participant and the issuer of such ETF shares, which transfer would occur at the price(s) used to calculate the net asset value of such ETF shares. For purposes of this Rule:  \n>  \n>(a) an \"authorized participant\" is an entity that has a written agreement with the issuer of ETF shares or one of its service providers, which allows the authorized participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of creation units (*i.e*., specified numbers of ETF shares); and  \n>  \n>(b) an \"issuer of ETF shares\" is an entity registered with the Commission as an open-ended management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nNoting:\n\n>This is a competitive filing that is substantially similar to rules in place on Cboe Exchange, Inc. (\u201cCboe\u201d) and its affiliates.3\n\nCBOE is the Chicago board options exchange - Susq/Cit playground. The rationale is:\n\n>The ability to effect in-kind transfers is a key component of the operational structure of an ETF and Options 6, Section 7 allows options-based ETFs to be more tax-efficient investment vehicles, to the benefit of their shareholders, and potentially resulting in transaction cost savings, which may be passed along to investors.\n\nNoting:\n\n>The Exchange now proposes to expand Options 6, Section 7 to mirror the Cboe Rule, which would permit in-kind transfers in connection with the creation or redemption of units issued by a UIT, another type of investment company registered under the 1940 Act\n\nAnd\n\n>Although options positions in connection with ETF and UIT (as proposed) creations and redemptions are transferred off the Exchange, they are not closed or \u201ctraded,\u201d and instead, merely reside in a different clearing account until closed in a trade on the Exchange or until they expire\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/phlx/2021/34-91887.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/phlx/2021/34-91887.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[What is a UIT?](https://preview.redd.it/i45xo3ke0yy61.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ecb44e67b7cda8aa929da4ce3cba8e97e3a39b)\n\nAnd then the prior NYSE proposal to amend rule SR-NYSE-2021-20\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Withdrawn SR-NYSE-2021-20](https://preview.redd.it/np79d6mq1yy61.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=e372dcfd5f409e05321984cc66d5a16e7f2e51ae)\n\n[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/04/26/2021-08566/self-regulatory-organizations-new-york-stock-exchange-llc-notice-of-filing-of-proposed-rule-change](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/04/26/2021-08566/self-regulatory-organizations-new-york-stock-exchange-llc-notice-of-filing-of-proposed-rule-change)\n\nWhy the fuck did they withdraw this rule? Sounds like they're about to fuck around with CLO's and CDO's big time with private funds and put those options into the UIT (private funds) with huge profits so then the investors get tax-free gains no?\n\nSounds like they think so too\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tge5gtlh2yy61.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=136ee23c7da769b21e3915c5c5a0c27b1ba52c51\n\nAny wrinkle-apes wanna give this a go? Sounds like moving big profits to tax-free UIT while some other entities get destroyed.\n\nI could use some correction though if I'm wrong about UIT's. But regardless why did the NYSE withdraw the amendment? Was it just a threat to the bad actors?",
