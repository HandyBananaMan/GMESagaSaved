<p>I'm an xx share holder. It's not much but it's what I can afford. Even with this, I will be keeping 25% of my shares forever in the hopes that hedgies can never close their short position. They're like the dragon sitting and guarding their mound of gold when they could have been working to better society. The fact that people can buy super yahts at the same time we have homeless people struggling is beyond me. Let's get rich, but let's also fix this world once money changes hands. ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ Forever</p>
