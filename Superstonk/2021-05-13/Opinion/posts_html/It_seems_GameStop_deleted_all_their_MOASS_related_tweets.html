<p>A lot of tin foil moments could be extracted from this. But I think they just don’t want to be scrutinized by the SEC. Part of me is wondering if Ryan Cohen being close to the SEC HQ and the closed meeting today had anything to do with it? I wonder if he’s a part of that meeting. Tin foiling is fun.</p>
