<p>This is a psychological game at this point.  We like the stock, and the math is telling us that they are fucked.</p>
<p>Do yourself a huge favour and don't freak out until this starts getting at least into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per share.</p>
<p>Like they say, if you can't handle me at my squizzle, then you don't deserve me when I squozle, so let's all just put up our feet and enjoy an ice cold Carlsberg, this is just the undercard.</p>
<p>Edit: I should say, excitement is good, just be in control of your emotions is all.</p>
