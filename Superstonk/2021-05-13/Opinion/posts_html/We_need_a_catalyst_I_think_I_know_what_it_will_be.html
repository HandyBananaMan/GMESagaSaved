<p>This may have been covered already, and/or I may be wrong, but I have a theory. I'm relying on this sub to poke holes in this theory or provide additional insight.</p>
<p>GameStop's moon tweet (below) has a pretty interesting element to it. The GameStop logo... It's GS not GameStop. They created <strong>(edited, ffs)</strong> this image which means they had control over every detail. I've done some searching and I can't find that GS logo anywhere on any official GameStop branding.</p>
<p>Why did they go with GS instead of their corporate logo? There's certainly enough room on the sleeve to use their corporate logo.</p>
<p><strong>I think they are going to rebrand</strong>. Now changing a logo in itself doesn't mean anything. BUT, if the logo change comes with an official name change (GS, Corp., for example), then this would cause a change in CUSIP number.</p>
<p>"It is my understanding that the mechanics of the CUSIP change (with name change) would effectively <strong>prevent trading shares of the old CUSIP # and would create an entirely new set of shares through the DTC</strong>. By doing this, the DTC is forced to account for ALL of the old shares exchanged for the new shares. <strong>Without the name change, the old shares would simply be renamed. With the name change, they are physically exchanged which will isolate phantom shares and force covering.</strong>" ^(sourced)</p>
<p>Is this what RC is planning? If so, this could be the catalyst we need...</p>

<p>Edit: they did not create the image itself, but they did edit it. And they edited it with a logo that I haven't previously seen and cannot find anywhere else.</p>
<p>Edit 2: did not site source for my confirmation bias on legal name change / CUSIP # implications. Yes, copied and pasted. The facts remain the same though.</p>

<p>Edit 3: I appreciate all the feedback, both positive and critical. I didn't expect this to gain this much traction. One piece I want to elaborate on is the rebranding. <strong>Whether they decide to rebrand or not, they may make the legal name change while keeping GameStop as their trade name (DBA).</strong> So there is merit to the point that they may not actually rebrand, but changing their legal name would require a change in CUSIP # which could be a catalyst. </p>
