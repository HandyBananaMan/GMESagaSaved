This is a psychological game at this point.  We like the stock, and the math is telling us that they are fucked.

Do yourself a huge favour and don't freak out until this starts getting at least into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per share.

Like they say, if you can't handle me at my squizzle, then you don't deserve me when I squozle, so let's all just put up our feet and enjoy an ice cold Carlsberg, this is just the undercard.

Edit: I should say, excitement is good, just be in control of your emotions is all.
