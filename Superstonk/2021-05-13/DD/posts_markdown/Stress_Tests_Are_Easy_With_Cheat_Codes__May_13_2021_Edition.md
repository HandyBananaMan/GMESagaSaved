For anyone who hasn't seen any of my previous posts on this, here's a little recap (including how this might relate to $GME) ...

For several weeks now I have been seeing wildly incorrect carry values on deep out of the money $BKNG Puts. The carry values should reflect the midpoint between the bid/ask. Options contract prices are multiplied by  100 since they cover 100 shares. So an option with a bid/ask of  $.40/$.80 should have a carry value of $60.

The problem with incorrect carry values on options is an account could look solvent when it is, in fact, very much insolvent, necessitating a  margin call. This might be especially handy in the middle of a stress test.

Now Citadel and other major players in the GME saga happen to carry a bunch of these Puts ($BKNG specifically, and many others generally). You can see the details here for yourself ([https://whalewisdom.com/stock/pcln](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/pcln)).  You'll find Citadel's holdings on page 13. Whether or not Citadel still carries a bunch of $BKNG Puts, and whether or not those Puts are affected by this "glitch," I do not know. One thing I do know is everyone needs to be aware of this, and this "glitch" needs to get fixed  ASAP.

You can read more about this in all my previous posts on the topic (with tons more examples of this total fuckery):

Now for today's option pricing dumpster fire:

**Once again, the carry value (the value these Puts add to my portfolio) is completely disconnected from the bid/ask and previous price. In fact, it's disconnected from all reality.**

As always, this is not financial advice, and purchasing OTM options are generally a  terrible, terrible investment. For anyone thinking there is "free money" here, there is not. This is about false carry values, and how this phenomenon has the potential to make an insolvent account look solvent. There is no real value to these puts, which is the problem I'm trying to highlight.

Edit #1: Yesterday, Friday, May 14, 2021 ... my Put carry values all checked out. Nothing crazy. Which is crazy. First time in weeks.

To celebrate, here are some new thoughts on the state of the market:
