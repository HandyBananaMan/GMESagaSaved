# SUPERSTONK IS ON FIRE!! 🔥 Another 2 AMA announcements!! CAN'T STOP WON'T STOP!

# [Award winning investigative journalist, Lucy Komisar is our guest tomorrow at 4:30 pm Eastern!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb0fuy/official_ama_lucy_komisar_awardwinning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Lucy has been covering financial and corporate corruption for decades, mainly through her online paper, [The Komisar Scoop.](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/) And the first time I spoke to Dr. T, and I told her how much I respected her not only as an OG ape, but as a **badass** feminist icon... (lowkey, I hate to even bring up gender here but it can't be dismissed...) she chuckled her warm chuckle and told me who she looks up to, and said "Pink, if you want a *real* icon... you all should talk to Lucy Komisar." That made me feel like I had been blessed by the lips of God... an icon that *my* icon looks up to? Let's get her stat!!! So in the whirlwind of AMAs that our mod team has managed to schedule and put together, (BIG thank you goes to u/StonkU2 for coordinating these connections!! 🙏🙏) we have managed to not only bring you the magnificent Lucy Komisar....

*Lucy will be here tomorrow at 4:30 pm Eastern, hosted by* u/luridess***.*** 

# [....But also next Tuesday we have Attorney Wes Christian](http://www.csj-law.com/attorneys/jchristian.html)!! (yes that's the one Carl slipped during the AMA!)

Wes Christian is a Texas attorney with an accent as big as his list of accomplishments! Once again I'm going to [shamelessly plug the old documentary Wall Street Conspiracy](https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU), where I first learned of Wes Christian along with all of the other OGs we've been talking to. And a fun fact... our former AMA guest and very favorite resident wrinkly brain, u/dlauer has served as an expert witness for Wes multiple times in the fight against naked short selling. They go way back...

# Which is why we're having Dlauer cohost this AMA with his old pal Wes!! We are literally assembling the dream team here!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[^(did I mention Dave Lauer is one of us)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/naoqr9/bought_some_gme_yesterday/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)^(?)

A note about yesterday's AMA with Carl Hagberg. I want to share this quote with you that had your mods nearly weeping with pride:

 **"*****I've been writing these letters & they're all posted on the SEC website & nobody's ever reading them & no one's ever responding to them, but social media doesn't doesn't go away, it can only grow. And I think if I was going to be optimistic, That would be the source of my optimism*****.**" Carl Hagberg, talking about social media/Superstonk   💖💖💖

&#x200B;

He also said he definitely believes based on the evidence that Gamestop will overvote (i.e. is over 100% shorted) and all we need to do to prove that is **VOTE!!**

&#x200B;

**Read** u/atobitt**'s** [**notes from after the AMA!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nazyz3/shorts_must_cover/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **ALL GME SHORTS MUST COVER!!**

&#x200B;

Also, Euroapes!! Carl says it is totally within your rights to vote!! You know what you should do? BOTHER THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR BROKER!!

Seriously. Write emails. Send chat messages. Call. Tweet. Take Surveys. Do what you have to do to expose EToro, T212, and more. **THEY'RE YOUR SHARES AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE!!!**

#  NSCC-006

There's been a lot of posts floating around this weekend pertaining to the new [NSCC-006 filing](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-006.pdf). Lots of hype, lots of mis-info, and we need to set the record straight first and foremost.

**What does 006 do?:**

**IT DOES** eliminate the 10 day waiting period before implementation after the DTCC and SEC approval process.

**What 006 DOESN'T do:**

**IT DOES NOT** implement any rules immediately. Including 002 or any others.

**IT DOES NOT** eliminate the need for the approval process on any rules including 002.

**IT DOES NOT** eliminate the extension already implemented on 002 or any others.

[not it ](https://preview.redd.it/3ubwvb50ety61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b74ba5c092e479e38c586c42c4a13440a1ba6557)

# THIS RULING DOES NOTHING FOR MOASS AS A STANDALONE RULE

*002 is still put off until June 21. It could be implemented well before then, we don't know. This is just the extended deadline. You can't deny that they are putting a LOT of rules in place that seem directly tied to GME and the exposure of naked short selling.*

[**Here's a post that talks about it more in detail.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7jphk/nscc006_doesnt_change_much_but_looking_forward_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[What the hell is a liquidity test anyway?](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/Clearing-Services/FICC/CCLF-Annual-Test-Reference-Doc.pdf)

Well... This doesn't effect anything in the market in real time, it is merely a computer simulation test meant to test the liquidity of the market when the new rules get implemented (think 002). It's odd that they would do a test that they *just* did in April, and they usually do **ANNUALLY,** to be doing it *again* just a **MONTH LATER**. And liquidity tests do require... liquidity... in order to pass them. So you *miiiiiight* need to sell a few things to rack up those liquid assets.....

# 🚨Live Recording🚨

**So yesterday the recording for the Audio Book,** [**Naked Short and Greedy by Dr. Susanne Trimbath**](https://spiramus.com/naked-short-and-greedy)**, officially began!! 🥳✨🎉🎊**

After getting my equipment acquired and set up ( not recording in the surroundings you see pictured!) I began recording the audio book version of the book that Dr. T so lovingly wrote to help people understand. I realize this is a business and finance title, but I think you'll be surprised at the storytelling in this incredible piece of DD. ;)

#  Meet Finley and Quinn Mulligan- The brothers behind the Apes Together Strong Documentary

*The one told by apes, for apes.*

[This is pasted from the OP by](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n9x3qw/documentary_update_its_all_about_the_apes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [u/albanak](https://www.reddit.com/u/albanak/)

🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍-- **INTRO** \-- 🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧

My name is Finley Mulligan ([u/albanak](https://www.reddit.com/u/albanak/)), my brother is Quinn Mulligan ([u/cyclopsQHM](https://www.reddit.com/u/cyclopsQHM/)). We are apes.

We've been hodling since early Jan, joined the exodus to [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) and eventually migrated with the first wave of settlers at [r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) — we are not outsiders, we want to make sure this story is told right and from within.

🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍-- **BACKGROUND** \-- 🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍🦧🦍

We got sick of seeing "retail" investors being portrayed like shit by the mainstream media.

We couldn't stand seeing the narrative build that the current untenable state of our markets is somehow *our fault* — meanwhile, everyone turns a blind eye to the corruption, illegal practices, and blatant manipulation being practiced by the "institutions" lining the pockets of the asshats condemning us.

Then the hulu doc came out and we kind of hit a limit. SO. I posted a simple question — "**Who wants a REAL documentary about what's happening with the squeeze**?" and the response was overwhelmingly positive — you had some key points of guidance:

* The story isn't done 'til the squeeze has squozen
* Ask the questions no one's asking (naked short selling, FTDs, etc)
* Make sure to features the community as much as possible
* Tell the truth even if the truth hurts
* Fuck off, we just like the stock (fair enough)

[**We took those tenets to heart and posted THIS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgoo4a/update_question_who_wants_a_real_documentary/)**.**

This story isn't finished.

It feels like a war of attrition at times but with new rules, SEC head, and the simple fact that time is on our side we believe that we will soon see an end to this saga.

This last act is still unfolding and we won’t be telling an unfinished story — apes are very clear that this film shouldn’t finish until the squeeze has squozen and we want to respect that.

We’ll be including the community throughout the creation of the film. Offering to show rough cuts, consulting when we’re stuck or need fresh eyes. We believe very much that community engagement is vital to being able to call this a film for apes by apes.

**Be excellent to each other!!!**

Be friendly, help others!

We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.**

**This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.**

Remember the fundamentals of this company.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.
