(lowkey, I hate to even bring up gender here but it can't be dismissed...) she chuckled her warm chuckle and told me who she looks up to, and said \"Pink, if you want a *real* icon... you all should talk to Lucy Komisar.\" That made me feel like I had been blessed by the lips of God... an icon that *my* icon looks up to? Let's get her stat!!!

Lots of hype, lots of mis-info, and we need to set the record straight first and foremost.\n\n**What does 006 do?:**\n\n**IT DOES** eliminate the 10 day waiting period before implementation after the DTCC and SEC approval process.\n\n**What 006 DOESN'T do:**\n\n**IT DOES NOT** implement any rules immediately. Including 002 or any others.\n\n**IT DOES NOT** eliminate the need for the approval process on any rules including 002.\n\n**IT DOES NOT** eliminate the extension already implemented on 002 or any others.\n\n[not it ](https://preview.redd.it/3ubwvb50ety61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b74ba5c092e479e38c586c42c4a13440a1ba6557)\n\n# THIS RULING DOES NOTHING FOR MOASS AS A STANDALONE RULE\n\n*002 is still put off until June 21. It could be implemented well before then, we don't know. This is just the extended deadline.

This doesn't effect anything in the market in real time, it is merely a computer simulation test meant to test the liquidity of the market when the new rules get implemented (think 002). It's odd that they would do a test that they *just* did in April, and they usually do **ANNUALLY,** to be doing it *again* just a **MONTH LATER**. And liquidity tests do require... liquidity... in order to pass them.

We are apes.\n\nWe've been hodling since early Jan, joined the exodus to [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) and eventually migrated with the first wave of settlers at [r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) \u2014\u00a0we are not outsiders, we want to make sure this story is told right and from within.\n\n\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d-- **BACKGROUND** \\-- \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\n\nWe got sick of seeing \"retail\" investors being portrayed like shit by the mainstream media.\n\nWe couldn't stand seeing the narrative build that the current untenable state of our markets is somehow *our fault* \u2014 meanwhile, everyone turns a blind eye to the corruption, illegal practices, and blatant manipulation being practiced by the \"institutions\" lining the pockets of the asshats condemning us.\n\nThen the hulu doc came out and we kind of hit a limit. SO. I posted a simple question \u2014 \"**Who wants a REAL documentary about what's happening with the squeeze**?\" and the response was overwhelmingly positive \u2014 you had some key points of guidance:\n\n* The story isn't done 'til the squeeze has squozen\n* Ask the questions no one's asking (naked short selling, FTDs, etc)\n* Make sure to features the community as much as possible\n* Tell the truth even if the truth hurts\n* Fuck off, we just like the stock (fair enough)\n\n[**We took those tenets to heart and posted THIS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgoo4a/update_question_who_wants_a_real_documentary/)**.**\n\nThis story isn't finished.\n\nIt feels like a war of attrition at times but with new rules, SEC head, and the simple fact that time is on our side we believe that we will soon see an end to this saga.\n\nThis last act is still unfolding and we won\u2019t be telling an unfinished story \u2014\u00a0apes are very clear that this film shouldn\u2019t finish until the squeeze has squozen and we want to respect that.\n\nWe\u2019ll be including the community throughout the creation of the film. Offering to show rough cuts, consulting when we\u2019re stuck or need fresh eyes. We believe very much that community engagement is vital to being able to call this a film for apes by apes.\n\nIf you'd like to follow along you can join our mailing list at [apestogetherstrongdoc.com](https://apestogetherstrongdoc.com/)\n\nor our twitter @ apestogetherdoc\n\nPlease hit us up at [info@apestogetherstrongdoc.com](mailto:info@apestogetherstrongdoc.com) or tag [u/albanak](https://www.reddit.com/u/albanak/) in any post you think is worth calling attention to!
