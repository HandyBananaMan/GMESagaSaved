Good morning Apetown!

As promised [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb5sh6/maybe_we_missed_some_triangles/gxxo5zm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb4tbl/ryan_cohen_tweet/gxxiq6y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I went to the GameStop the one and only ChairMan himself was at last night to see if I could do some digging around into whether there was some hidden meaning in the games displayed in his tweet.

**TL;DR: Inconclusive. EDIT: Some apes find it more conclusive than I did. Conspicuously placed on the "D" shelf was Crash. H/T to** u/Noderpsy **and** u/Kuzuuryu1.

Sorry my simian sisters and brothers. That's not to say, though, that you can't draw your own conclusions from the pics I took.

As you can see it's definitely the same GameStop:

(One of the reasons why it took a little longer than expected was because there was an actual patron there, who was *very* enthusiastic about talking about the MCU and WWE -- hence Ry-Guy's new nickname above.)

But, and I know this is what you're really here for, here's a picture of The Rack:

So, since you very discerning apes were able to make out the blurry images next to The Hedgeclipper in his tweet (some of you have been mixing carrots into your banana smoothies!), you'll no doubt see that there are some titles that are the same (Children of Morta, Crackdown, etc.), some that are new (Spyro, some pre-used games), and some that are conspicuously missing (Crash, Valhalla, The Surge).

I asked the employee who opened (who I was going to take a picture of, but he declined becoming Internet famous -- I'll get to him more in a sec though) if he was there last night, and he said that he had left around 5:30, and that he wasn't aware that The Hedgeclipper was there afterward until I told him. I also saw him straightening the display before the store opened and asked if he had rearranged that particular shelf before I got there, and he said that he hadn't, that he was mostly just putting headphones on to the right of this shelf.

So, what to believe? Did the closer do his normal duty and make it look good? Possible. Did SÃ±r Cohen purposefully place them there? The world may never know...

For what it's worth, the rest of the titles were pretty much entirely arranged alphabetically, so if there's any indication the ones in The Hedgeclipper's tweet *were not*, I would be mui suspiciado (or something, I'm not a Spanish-speaking ape). Your eyes are better than mine, so I'll let you decide that.

Just a couple other notes from my visit:

* The aforementioned employee said that he works there entirely because he enjoys it, that he's a retired Marine who was shot twice in Afghanistan, so he doesn't have to work at all if he doesn't want to.
* I asked how many people worked at that store, and he said about 5. Rest assured, fellow apes, all of them will be well taken care of when this is all over.
* He doesn't do social media, like, at all, so he was not aware of what's about to happen. Because he was helping customers before, during, and after my visit, I was unable to inform him more unfortunately.
* I've had a nagging unease in the back of my mind since this all started, because I recalled early in the pandemic that some GameStop stores refused to close because they were "essential". I asked if that was the case at this location, and he said no, since the whole mall was closed, but also that every story on the East Coast closed anyway; it was just in states that didn't require closing at all that they remained open. Now, nothing is a given, but I have a feeling that this is the sort of practice that will definitely change under The Hedgeclipper. No ape left behind.

Hopefully this scratches your itch, fellow apes.

To the moon! :)
