So the liquidity test is a "stress test" where they run a simulation to check that brokers MM and HF's have the required liquidity right?

So why are they told in advance when it is coming just so they can ensure they do have the liquidity.?? surely it should be a test they are not told about  and no stupid games can be played otherwise it is a false positive result??

How many of you have ever had the heads up from your employer of the date you will be having a random Drugs tests? 

Or when you were in school given advance notice of a random pop test along with the subject details. 

in theory its the same thing and they will just back to their old ways once the test is over. This should be random without notice.

I may have the purpose of the test wrong, its early and i'm grumpy so please do correct me if im wrong.
