We seem to forget that Ken is a hedge fund manager with his hands in a lot of cookie jars. He and his cronies have got themselves into this mess of their own accord.

He tried to become a bank in the past and failed.

The government will not bail them out.

Buy, hold, vote if you can!

This not not financial advice...

EDIT: This is in regards to the recent news about the 400 billion being lent out. We don't have all the information.

The worst thing we can do is jump to conclusions in absence of the facts.

Patience fellow apes!
