<p>We seem to forget that Ken is a hedge fund manager with his hands in a lot of cookie jars. He and his cronies have got themselves into this mess of their own accord.</p>
<p>He tried to become a bank in the past and failed.</p>
<p>The government will not bail them out.</p>
<p>Buy, hold, vote if you can!</p>
<p>This not not financial advice...</p>
<p>EDIT: This is in regards to the recent news about the 400 billion being lent out. We don't have all the information.</p>
<p>The worst thing we can do is jump to conclusions in absence of the facts.</p>
<p>Patience fellow apes!</p>
