<p>So the liquidity test is a "stress test" where they run a simulation to check that brokers MM and HF's have the required liquidity right?</p>
<p>So why are they told in advance when it is coming just so they can ensure they do have the liquidity.?? surely it should be a test they are not told about  and no stupid games can be played otherwise it is a false positive result??</p>
<p>How many of you have ever had the heads up from your employer of the date you will be having a random Drugs tests? </p>
<p>Or when you were in school given advance notice of a random pop test along with the subject details. </p>
<p>in theory its the same thing and they will just back to their old ways once the test is over. This should be random without notice.</p>
<p>I may have the purpose of the test wrong, its early and i'm grumpy so please do correct me if im wrong.</p>
