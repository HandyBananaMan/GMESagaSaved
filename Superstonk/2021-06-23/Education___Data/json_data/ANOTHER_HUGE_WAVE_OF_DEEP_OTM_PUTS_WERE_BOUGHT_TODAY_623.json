Today there was a huge wave of DEEP OTM Puts purchased from a multitude of exchanges with many returning from last weeks purchases.\n\n[GME Biggest Options Trades 6-23-21](https://preview.redd.it/jua6a8cbh4771.png?width=1131&format=png&auto=webp&s=bef305027a8629df21ef6d76debcb3ebffc66962)\n\nAs you can see from the data set above there was a massive wave of Puts purchased between 11am-12pm today. The main strikes we saw action on were the $20, $25, and $30 Puts. We even saw a familiar trade type out of MRX (Nasdaq) with the SingLegAuctNonISO (this is the same rare trade type we saw on the DEEP ITM Calls out of PHLX a couple months ago.) I'm going to drop the data from Monday and Tuesday below as well even though there wasn't nearly the same activity.\n\n[GME Biggest Options Trades 6-22-21](https://preview.redd.it/r5rg9sfch4771.png?width=1131&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fdccb6fe0a23c50415cbbf607e6d64b62c46e31)\n\n[GME Biggest Options Trades 6-21-21](https://preview.redd.it/hdlunb1eh4771.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b7c3abb0f2e0354e8f504bed6ad3f51662c30fa)\n\nDefinitely a more diverse group of options were purchased on Monday and Tuesday but Wednesday's trades are definitely something of note. As always I will continue to monitor the data to see how this shakes out. See you soon\n\nRed crayons taste the best; change my mind. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c",
