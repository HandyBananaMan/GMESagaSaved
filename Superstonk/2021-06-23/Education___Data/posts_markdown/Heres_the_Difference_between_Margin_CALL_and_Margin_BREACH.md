I’m sure we’ve seen recent news that the NSCC got hit with a 1.06B margin breach in Q1 of 2021, but what does that actually mean? And what’s the difference between a margin breach and a call?

Margin Breach - what happens when intraday market movements cause the actual market-to-market exposure in the account of a clearinghouse member to exceed the initial margin held against that member

Margin Call - what happens when the value of an account drops below the margin requirement, and the investor must deposit more funds or sell long positions to meet the margin requirement

Margin breach is what happens intraday, it’s like watching your margin account fall below the requirements several times in one day but not get margin called. It simply means your account value has “breached” below the level of margin that’s required to maintain your portfolio. It can either resolve by immediately depositing money or selling long positions to maintain requirements without receiving a margin call, or it can resolve itself by the underlying dropping so that short positions are no longer in breach territory. Whatever the case may be, the premise is that margin breachers would’ve been margin called if all variables during the breach was sustained.

Margin call is when your broker goes “hey, we need funds NOW either from you depositing money or from you selling some positions to free up cash, if you don’t do either, we will begin forcibly closing your positions for you.”

Now, I’m assuming that short positions were extremely close to margin call territory back in late January since they suffered heavy breaches, but seeing as the price has never gone up and sustained above 350+, I don’t think any of the big players has been margin called yet since we didn’t have NSCC-2021-002 yet.
