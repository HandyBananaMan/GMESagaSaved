<p>What up Apes,</p>
<p>Its your boy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Dan_Bren/">u/Dan_Bren</a> back with the mid-week update. Today there was a huge wave of DEEP OTM Puts purchased from a multitude of exchanges with many returning from last weeks purchases.</p>

<p>As you can see from the data set above there was a massive wave of Puts purchased between 11am-12pm today. The main strikes we saw action on were the $20, $25, and $30 Puts. We even saw a familiar trade type out of MRX (Nasdaq) with the SingLegAuctNonISO (this is the same rare trade type we saw on the DEEP ITM Calls out of PHLX a couple months ago.) I'm going to drop the data from Monday and Tuesday below as well even though there wasn't nearly the same activity.</p>

<p>Definitely a more diverse group of options were purchased on Monday and Tuesday but Wednesday's trades are definitely something of note. As always I will continue to monitor the data to see how this shakes out. See you soon</p>
