<p>Apefrens, putting my jacked tits and raging priapism aside for a moment, I wanted to offer some DD that I haven't seen discussed in detail-- the 'digital dividend' from Overstock and how that can play into GME's NFT issuance slated for July 14 (per <a href="https://etherscan.io">etherscan.io</a>). I also reviewed the general timing and magnitude of Overstock's two separate 'squeeze' events, including the 60% rise early on everyone said was done... until six months later it rose more than 17x (with only minimal recorded short interest that is dwarfed by GME's SI). </p>
<p>For those who haven't seen it there's an overview video some guy named Crypto Chico put together to discuss GME's bombshell news about NFTs. I just tried searching for that sauce, but it was after I searched how to fix an erection that lasts more than 4 hours... so now I am fast forwarding barbaric 'one weird trick' videos before my kids TV shows. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to the DD-- I read through the federal PACER docket for the Overstock case and it's a doozy:</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Hedgies are fukt beyond belief. After an initial 'fake squeeze' the real Overstock squeeze went up 17x despite far, far less short interest than what's reported on GME (either 140% or various 'current' figures). The second squeeze ran over the course of 4 months after the digital dividend issuance. The details of the court case almost certainly create legal precedent for GME to do the same, effectively creating a share recall. GME's case (if even required) would be even more compelling than Overstock's case for multiple reasons- to include Overstock's CEO was personally targeted for actions that are irrelevant to Daddy Cohen. Don't date Russian spies (more later). MOASS inevitable, hodl on and buckle up!</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>For those who prefer videos, Overstock's CEO Dr. Patrick Byrne's fight with the DTCC and others to adopt blockchain standards started almost a decade ago. This video does a good job explaining foundational elements of this debate that is now coming to the fore:</p>

<p>As for my written DD I'll try to divide and conquer to digest as easily as possible.</p>

<p><strong>What is a digital dividend?</strong></p>
<p>Blockchain technology-- which is the underpinning technology for NFTs, smart contracts, cryptos, etc.-- is the basis for a digital dividend. Blockchain has numerous applications and without going too deep, suffice it to say its current state is a bit like the internet in late 90s-- the potential applications are massive and only just starting to be realized. I'll have more posts on blockchain capabilities later. In full disclosure I was an early investor in Overstock's blockchain subsidiary called tZero. I've also filed my own blockchain patents to expose fraud that I hope can be put to use someday in the fight against corruption in Wall Street/DC.</p>
<p>A blockchain digital dividend like Overstock's 'OSTKO' trades much like any other stock-- or like other cryptocurrencies and digital assets for that matter. Overstock issued it as a preferred share of equity in exchange for 10 shares of common equity. So while normal cash dividends can be simply paid out by shorts, a digital dividend cannot. This in effect forced shorts to buyback and cover, which triggered a share recall. This is a powerful force in GME's arsenal to force Mayo boy and friends to start buying to cover as well. </p>
<p>Another important wrinkle is that the preferred equity could not trade initially for the first 6 months due to SEC regulations. So while the digital dividend was issued in compliance with SEC regs, that included a 6 month window wherein it could not be bought/sold immediately. This created a lock-up that further forced shorts to cover. Shorts don't ever "like" dividends since they have to pay them to the borrower, but when its just cash that's a relatively small sum. Digital dividends make that impossible though, and force shorts to cover their open positions. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Overstock's so called 'squeeze' and subsequent true SQUEEZE</strong></p>
<p>I hope some Apes with better DD archeology skills than me can verify this, but I recall hearing the reported short interest in Overstock was just 6% at the time this all started. The initial 'squeeze' resulted in the class action lawsuit from Mangrove Partners and other shorts that were shorting Overstock shares. Overstock's CEO, Dr. Patrick Byrne, comes off as a bit of a mad-scientist but this m'f'king genius was talking about blockchain and the DTCC almost a freaking decade ago. He also was apparently romantically linked to a now infamous Russian Spy, Maria Butini, but more on that later. </p>
<p>Here's a look at Overstock's value and the timeline for its squeeze</p>
<p><img alt="Overstock's value from announcement of digital dividend to effective squeeze" src="https://preview.redd.it/vd4h2uq8q2771.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f628ed2426a996342090d5f0e0ebf6ac14b9e6c3" /></p>
<p>From the court case it is apparent short sellers and others referred to Overstock's initial run-up of \~60% as the short squeeze. Yes, that little unteased nipple there. That was the squeeze. This occurred in the fall of 2019 when it was anticipated the date of the digital dividend would be announced Sept 23, 2019 and issued Nov 15, 2019. </p>
<p><img alt="Court Docket of originally anticipated digital dividend issuance timeline- triggering 60&#37; 'squeeze'" src="https://preview.redd.it/a18d55xbr2771.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6286bd22f62e2834a24ac49ede1da9b3a95e199" /></p>
<p>A Bloomberg article at the time spoke of the "remarkable" 65% run up in price as shorts initially began to cover for fear of the lock-up and digital dividend:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Bloomberg article about remarkable 65&#37; short squeeze" src="https://preview.redd.it/1fklz0vsr2771.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24675a47908d22e64dcb7d7864b6ca3b582e3c37" /></p>
<p>Well, Overstock stepped back from that ledge and announced they would delay issuance for several more months so the digital dividend could in fact be traded immediately upon issuance (thus alleviating lock-up concerns). The shorts apparently felt this meant the squeeze had squoze, and went back about their merry way... sound familiar? They were so convinced they even included it as one of their main motions against Dr. Byrne, as they felt he was profiting from insider trading when he sold his shares shortly before the initial 'squeeze'. Ironically, Byrne missed out on hundreds of millions, possibly even billions, as a result of exiting the company long before the real squeeze commenced. He left because he couldn't obtain DNO insurance (for Board Directors) after his relationship with a Russian spy started to be known publicly. The shorts seized upon that information, and even went so far as to say he effectuated this "squeeze" of 60% to profit prior to his departure. The shorts then reported though that the squeeze had "officially ended" on Sept 18, 2019 with Overstock's 8-K filing:</p>
<p><img alt="\&quot;On Sept 18 2019 Overstock officially ended the short squeeze\&quot;-- words from the short sellers themselves in their complaint. Little did they know what was to come!!" src="https://preview.redd.it/gqnsnrb2v2771.png?width=929&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4503bdfe66f7c013dd9bd44b156ff4796c4f5169" /></p>
<p>The digital dividend was eventually issued as OSTKO trading on Overstock's blockchain subsidiary tZero on April 27, 2020. Overstock's value on the prior trading day was $7.24 on April 24, 2020 (per Yahoo finance). The day of the issuance its value went up 30+% and the run-up from there was considered astronomical at the time. It still took approximately 4 months to peak on August 20, 2020 at $124.65/share. </p>
<p><strong>$124.65/$7.24 = 17.2x increase</strong> </p>
<p>I'd reiterate I was unable to find reported short interest (SI) in April 2019 but have heard estimates in the 6% range. Any links Apefrens may have would be greatly appreciated. I also don't know how to mathematically model the impact an exact, known SI in GME would compare to the SI in Overstock. We obviously don't know the SI in GME but I doubt it's anywhere near the currently reported levels-- and even those are far, far greater than 6%. Point is, Overstock went up more than 17x after the shorts 'thought' the original squeeze was done. Additionally, that's with an SI that was never anywhere near the total float and is far less than the 'currently known' SI in GME-- let alone all the rehypothecated, synthetic, counterfeit bs Apes have uncovered. The rocket fuel from apes owning more than 100% of the float combined with these already powerful mathematics is just like dividing by zero-- the answer is infinity. </p>

<p><strong>Legal case details and excerpts from court docket</strong></p>
<p>As if my tits weren't already jacked to the max, the more I read in the court docket the more I had to change my shorts (bu-dum-bum Dad joke!). The link above, mind you, is just one document in a docket that is 130+ entries long. At 27 pages that linked document is actually relatively brief, especially compared to the follow-on whining and bitching from the shorts crying that Overstock wasn't playing nicely in their fraudulent little sandbox. Here it is again in case you can't sleep:</p>
<p><a href="https://ecf.utd.uscourts.gov/doc1/18315114807">https://ecf.utd.uscourts.gov/doc1/18315114807</a></p>
<p>I'm not a lawyer or registered securities agent of any kind so this is obviously not financial advice, nor legal advice. Please don't sue me, I'm just using public records and trying to shine some light on information that is hard to find. Do whatever you think is best for you.</p>
<p>The shorts essentially filed 4 counts against Overstock, all of which the Judge dismissed. I'll attempt an Ape translation below:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/4ckv7jm2x2771.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1057374a86eaef60890488788e81f81a241aff9</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Count 1: normal pointless whining "you didn't tell us a share price could go up or down". Shorts argued that Overstock misrepresented its financial performance. Judge says "bs"</p>
<p>Count 2: picture market manipulating short-sellers pointing the Spiderman meme at eachother claiming Overstock was the manipulator. Judge says "bs"</p>
<p>Count 3: some highly technical s**t about whether the CFO or CEO or other controlling persons did something nefarious ("scienter") and whether that amounted to a problem under stricter standards of the PSLRA. I believe this is where the shorts inserted an obscure "gotcha" footnote that should have been a motion unto itself, but more on that later. Don't read this part, it's like the Aliens at the bar in Star Wars jabbering on and on in foreign languages, over details that are arcane and irrelevant. Big upshot: Judge says "bs" to the shorts.</p>
<p>Count 4: Byrne was known by everyone to be a personal crusader against naked short sellers and the shorts had a personal vendetta against him. They wanted to go after him individually for insider trading-- though ironically he completely missed the vast majority of the squeeze by leaving the company (also to his credit he's willing to engage in discussion on legitimate uses for non-naked short selling, and no matter how much I disagree with his personal politics, I admire the heck out of the guy for his tenacity to fight). Judge says "bs" yet again-- that's 4 for 4 against the shorts. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, at the risk of sounding like Captain Obvious it's important to clarify that courts and judges are by definition partisan professionals throughout their careers. That's right, judges are basically politicians with a $10 robe from Walmart on. I am personally more left of center than right, but regardless of wherever you land on the spectrum here's an important excerpt from the Judges wiki page: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Wikipedia profile of Judge Dale Kimball presiding over the short-sellers lawsuit against Overstock" src="https://preview.redd.it/pos5xis223771.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da0db056f9cb820a63d0fdfd0bfc3b90b1dcb6ef" /></p>
<p>I say that's important because Dr. Byrne has never been shy about his personal political viewpoints, and suffice it to say he is on the <em>polar opposite</em> end of the spectrum in 2016 and especially 2020. I think that's a beautiful part of this whole movement though, because the Judge in his ruling basically told the short-sellers unequivocally to eat a bag of dicks-- even though they were going after Byrne personally in many attacks. If there was ever a case of the greater external enemy bringing together people with highly divergent baseline viewpoints this is it. A Clinton appointed Judge defending a guy who was crusading on the opposite side of the political spectrum in 2016 and 2020 (sorry to dance around key words, don't want to get moderated out and don't want to get too far off on a tangent here). My point is never underestimate the amount of disdain the general public has for these manipulative short selling insider hedgies. That disdain is far reaching and bipartisan. So whenever MOASS lights off and the shills start spreading FUD that Apes are "destroying the economy" this is clear bipartisan evidence that people support us, not them.</p>
<p>The Judge probably put it most succintly himself as part of his decision:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/k7a3482a54771.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c737ff8a68f8bbfe6a5e17711e34b501094ef7b</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/qsymgnk864771.png?width=943&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c79fac662b3f94a7303932941438621c03c5f60</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/rm63osmm64771.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b99f4c37d01b6e5df3e1edaa67a5724735a2962</p>
<p>Now I have to admit it's difficult to decipher exactly which portions of the writing are being authored by the defense counsel and which portions are being authored directly by the court/Judge. Having said that, the Judge agreed with dismissing all four counts, and I'm hoping a wrinkle brain out there could say which of the above came from defense as opposed to the court. The way it reads to me the discussion seems to be entirely authored by the court because it references "The court finds..." in the third person frequently and had the Judges signature at the bottom. Regardless, the key takeaway points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Short sellers are not entitled to special treatment, they know the risk to the game they choose to play</li>
<li>A digital dividend can serve a legitimate business purpose, not just a short squeeze</li>
<li>The short sellers personal vendetta against Byrne was apparent throughout and would be completely irrelevant if Mayo boy had a beef with Cohen. Their primary argument against Byrne was for insider trading, and that was clearly dismissed (ironically, history shows he missed the biggest portions of the squeeze regardless)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, why would the Judge then later vacate his own decision? Well, unbeknownst to the court, it turns out the shorts inserted a technical item in that obscure footnote I mentioned earlier. I could be paranoid, but I wouldn't put it past a sleezebag lawyer to purposefully hide such a thing in a footnote. Sorry, just my personal bias. The court caught the issue with the footnote and frankly the Judge doesn't sound thrilled about having to vacate his own decision as a result:</p>
<p><img alt="Source: https:\/\/ecf.utd.uscourts.gov\/doc1\/18315209043" src="https://preview.redd.it/kv571yso84771.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=036b24d06fa44e04a1fac81d5291905435cd7963" /></p>
<p>Ape translation: way to go fuckface, you got me. I'm on to your trick now though and to err on the side of the most bulletproof procedural approach I'll vacate the decision and re-consider it all in a motion to dismiss. Lawyer Apes, please correct me if I'm wrong here. I just have to think a court doesn't like being caught in this sort of situation having to repeat the process. And unless there's some smoking gun that completely invalidates the prior hundreds of court entries and prior thousands of pages, the same outcome seems to be all but certain. </p>
<p><strong>Why GME has even more compelling right to use digital dividend if they choose</strong></p>
<p>The hearing on that repeat re-consideration for procedural thoroughness was held on 6/18/2021. The results could very well be known within that legal community, and even if not, could also be out prior to the July 14 NFT minting. I have faith the team at GME understands 1000% how to approach this with every lawyerly bs checkmark checked off exactly where it needs to be. </p>
<p>The tone of the decision paints a pretty clear picture that the court will not suffer fools and does not wish to make any special exception for short sellers. Additionally, much of the case was motivated by the short sellers personal vendetta against Byrne and his high-profile crusade against naked short selling. The best mud the shorts could sling against him was his romantic ties to a Russian spy, and even that had no adverse impact on the outcome of the case. What is Mayo boy going to do to smear RC's character? Claim a meme in swimshorts with a goldfish erection is market manipulation? Good luck. The world loves RC and hates Citadel, it's that simple. The man created Chewy and we love our pets. Go fuck yourself Mayo boy.</p>
<p>What's more, the discussion clearly points to the fact a legitimate business purpose was part of the digital dividend intent and not 'just' a short squeeze. GameStop has already hired on a first rate team of blockchain experts and publicly made it clear that they are pivoting to a technology innovation company, not a retail brick and mortar. They can use blockchain and NFTs to source chain of custody and title for content creators, enable collectibles markets, and re-sale of games in an iTunes type model. There are a million ways blockchain absolutely could and should be core to GameStop's future strategy. GameStop is to blockchain as Amazon was to the internet in the 90's. Only this time GameStop is the innovator, and they're going to take the world by storm.</p>
<p>Not financial advice, not a lawyer, I'm nobody. But I'm bullish AF for a digital dividend and the strategic vision that GME has created. Git sum!!!</p>
