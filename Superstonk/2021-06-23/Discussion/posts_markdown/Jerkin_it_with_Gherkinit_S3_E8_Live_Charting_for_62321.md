Reddit having some issues...I hope this loads. Nice little run up let's see if we can stay above VWAP and continue into power hour

Edit 6 1:53

The pickles aren't even capable of bring the stock up today, volume currently at 2.44M ...

Edit 5 12:40

Getting pulled of VWAP from drop on the S&P volume is currently to low to resist market sway

Edit 4 11:19

Downward consolidating wedge on the 1-minute might break us back up through VWAP

Edit 3 10:46

Failed that test at 220 back down to VWAP volume may not be high enough to hold

Edit 2 10:33

Ah yes going up on no volume, always feels nice

Nice opening dip, dropped below VWAP volume dwindling

# Pre-Market Analysis

53k Premarket volume, 35,000 shares to borrow looks like the stock is nicely moving towards that new support at 225.20. I hopefully today we can see some price improvement with everything going on, I'll admit it's getting hard to make sideways chop really POP! Today -002 supposedly goes into effect which should mean that capital requirements are going to be checked daily instead of monthly. If this is enforced we may see a rapid acceleration in the T+X cycles.
