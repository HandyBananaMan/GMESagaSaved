Once Marge calls, the party whoâ€™s been called has a short amount of time to cover. They are only liquidated if they are unable to meet their obligations.

Iâ€™m just as excited as ever about the new rules going active today, and Iâ€™m sure they will *begin* to set things in motion â€” **but it will not be immediate!**

We all know the drill by now â€” buy, hold, and wait patiently. 

The rocket is on the launchpad, and the countdown has begun. Buckle up, and enjoy the ride! ðŸš€
