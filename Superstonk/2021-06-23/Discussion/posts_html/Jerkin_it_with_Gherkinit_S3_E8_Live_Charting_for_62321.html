<p>Edit 7 2:47</p>
<p>Reddit having some issues...I hope this loads. Nice little run up let's see if we can stay above VWAP and continue into power hour</p>

<p>Edit 6 1:53</p>
<p>The pickles aren't even capable of bring the stock up today, volume currently at 2.44M ...</p>

<p>Edit 5 12:40</p>
<p>Getting pulled of VWAP from drop on the S&amp;P volume is currently to low to resist market sway</p>

<p>Edit 4 11:19</p>
<p>Downward consolidating wedge on the 1-minute might break us back up through VWAP</p>

<p>Edit 3 10:46</p>
<p>Failed that test at 220 back down to VWAP volume may not be high enough to hold</p>

<p>Edit 2 10:33</p>
<p>Ah yes going up on no volume, always feels nice</p>

<h1>Pre-Market Analysis</h1>
<p>53k Premarket volume, 35,000 shares to borrow looks like the stock is nicely moving towards that new support at 225.20. I hopefully today we can see some price improvement with everything going on, I'll admit it's getting hard to make sideways chop really POP! Today -002 supposedly goes into effect which should mean that capital requirements are going to be checked daily instead of monthly. If this is enforced we may see a rapid acceleration in the T+X cycles.</p>
