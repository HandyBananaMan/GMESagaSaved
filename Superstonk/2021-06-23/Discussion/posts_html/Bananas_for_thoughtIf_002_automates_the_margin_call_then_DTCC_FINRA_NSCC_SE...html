<p>I honestly am not saying anything new to Apes... that all the 'governing' agencies have known all along about the FTDs, SI, etc and not acted - publicly.  The DD produced by Apes has uncovered all of this.</p>
<p>Hear me out for one second... 002 was made effective in an accelerated manner.  As 002 will automate the margin call process, this means that a system has to be in place to do so.  The system will depend on having access to the necessary data in a timely manner in order to create the margin call.  </p>
<p>Apes, a system like this does not just pop up overnight.  Hardware needs to be installed, and software must be written AND tested AND tested again (put a few more AND's after this) before something like this can be launched.  AND there has to be a (now, if not before, continuous) flow of data from the members into this system for it to work.  From the members side they also have to have a system for the reporting of the data to the regulating bodies.  </p>
<p>I am hard pressed to believe that ALL of this was implemented from scratch from the time 002 was proposed until going active.  Much of the reporting was likely already being done AND compiled at the governing bodies.  The governing bodies likely have had access to the necessary information to make the margin call determination for ages.  </p>
<p>Again, I am not telling Apes anything that they have not already figured out for themselves.  But to a wider audience, THINK... the very fact that 002 CAN be implemented, proves that the governing bodies have had the information about what Citadel and the hedge funds have been doing.  </p>
<p>Just my attempt to help others obtain a wrinkle or two.  </p>
<p>Obligatory:  This is not financial advice.  I like the stock.  I eat crayons - purple being my favorite.  I have bought and HODL.</p>
