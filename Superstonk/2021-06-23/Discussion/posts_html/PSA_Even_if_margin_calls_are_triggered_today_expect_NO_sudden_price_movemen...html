<p>Once Marge calls, the party whoâ€™s been called has a short amount of time to cover. They are only liquidated if they are unable to meet their obligations.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m just as excited as ever about the new rules going active today, and Iâ€™m sure they will <em>begin</em> to set things in motion â€” <strong>but it will not be immediate!</strong></p>
