I hopefully today we can see some price improvement with everything going on, I'll admit it's getting hard to make sideways chop really POP! Today -002 supposedly goes into effect which should mean that capital requirements are going to be checked daily instead of monthly. If this is enforced we may see a rapid acceleration in the T+X cycles.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0j5q1fye0771.png?width=1615&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d41b9112989f23e2b5b7e0547901b58f4e7aa4\n\nAlso here is our Cup & Handle on the 1D timescale, remember that all cup and handles are not equal and to check with a registered financial advisor before committing to some of the fraudulent cup and handles you've seen popping up :)\n\n[Cup & Handle on the 1D timescale with supporting ascending triangle ](https://preview.redd.it/gn8gedm3g0771.png?width=1829&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fcc950fe7dfa231a381045cfe2735adc99a62cd)\n\n*\\* Although my profession is day trading, I in no way endorse day-trading of GME not only does it present significant risk, it can delay the squeeze.*\n\n*\\*My YouTube channel is \"monetized\" if that is something you are uncomfortable with, I understand, while I wouldn't say I profit greatly from the views, I do suggest you use ad-block when viewing it if you feel so compelled.* *My intention is simply benefit this community.
