They are only liquidated if they are unable to meet their obligations.\n\nI\u2019m just as excited as ever about the new rules going active today, and I\u2019m sure they will *begin* to set things in motion \u2014 **but it will not be immediate!**\n\nWe all know the drill by now \u2014 buy, hold, and wait patiently. \n\nThe rocket is on the launchpad, and the countdown has begun.
