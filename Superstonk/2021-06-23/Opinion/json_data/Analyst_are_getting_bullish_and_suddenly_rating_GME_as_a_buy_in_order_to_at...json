    "selftext": "By setting bullish price targets they\u2019re not only covering their own asses so that they can deny they were complicit in trying to knock GME down all those months.\n\nThey\u2019re also trying to spin a new narrative so that they can protect the all-important old narrative that shorts mainly covered in January and short interest remains low. They\u2019re going to try to say that the price run-up coming in the next weeks is because of an increasingly bullish outlook for the company, an outlook they themselves are responsible for! \n\nThe powers are desperate to retain some shred of control over price movement. By having their analysts get bullish and set price targets they\u2019ll be trying to maintain the myth that short interest and a short squeeze have nothing to do with the price running up. They\u2019re trying to regain some trust with \u2018dumb money\u2019 so that they can manipulate \u2018dumb money\u2019 into selling once those price targets have been achieved.\n\nAt worst they\u2019ll have plausible deniability going forward, where they can tell the people who read their garbage and believe in their analysis of other stocks that they were indeed bullish on GME.",
