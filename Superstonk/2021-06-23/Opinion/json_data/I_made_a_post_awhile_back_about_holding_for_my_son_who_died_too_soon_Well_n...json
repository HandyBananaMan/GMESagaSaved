    "selftext": "My son died in 2013 of appendicitis. A treatable illness. So why did my son die since it\u2019s treatable? \n\nI was a single mom of an 8 year old child who suddenly got sick at school one day. I took him to the hospital and he was diagnosed as having a virus. He died 2 days later due to sepsis caused by undiagnosed appendicitis. \n\nThat is what happens when you\u2019re poor. The newspaper decides to run a front page headline calling your child\u2019s illness untreated rather that undiagnosed. This front page headline gives the community the impression that he died due to parental neglect. So the doctor goes into my sons medical records and changes some wording in order to further push this narrative. The hospital deploys their best lawyers to protect the doctor who misdiagnosed my son. \n\nAfter years and years of them beating me down as a parent and person they are faced with the evidence by a world renowned expert that my son could have been saved that day in the ER but also that the standard of care was not performed which resulted in my sons death. So they drag the lawsuit out for 5 years, destroy any sense of self worth I had as a person and pay me a minute amount to buy my silence. My silence comes with their admission of guilt but off the books. No formal charges are filed against the Dr. or hospital.\n\nThis is the why the rich are powerful and the poor are silenced. They will kill our kids to get rich. And when they do they will alter records and lie under oath with no consequences. \n\nI want to fuck Wall Street for every person who died of medical neglect due to exorbitant medical costs or subpar care because they hate poor people.",
