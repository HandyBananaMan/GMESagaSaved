By setting bullish price targets they’re not only covering their own asses so that they can deny they were complicit in trying to knock GME down all those months.

They’re also trying to spin a new narrative so that they can protect the all-important old narrative that shorts mainly covered in January and short interest remains low. They’re going to try to say that the price run-up coming in the next weeks is because of an increasingly bullish outlook for the company, an outlook they themselves are responsible for! 

The powers are desperate to retain some shred of control over price movement. By having their analysts get bullish and set price targets they’ll be trying to maintain the myth that short interest and a short squeeze have nothing to do with the price running up. They’re trying to regain some trust with ‘dumb money’ so that they can manipulate ‘dumb money’ into selling once those price targets have been achieved.

At worst they’ll have plausible deniability going forward, where they can tell the people who read their garbage and believe in their analysis of other stocks that they were indeed bullish on GME.
