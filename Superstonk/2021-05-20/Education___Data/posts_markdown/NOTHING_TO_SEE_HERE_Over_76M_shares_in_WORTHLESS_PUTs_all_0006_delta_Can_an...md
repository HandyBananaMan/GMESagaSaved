#Title: NOTHING TO SEE HERE. Over 7.6M shares in WORTHLESS PUTs (all <0.006 delta). Can anyone say MANIPULATION? Married PUTs theory confirmed in AMA with Wes. Evidence here. Next week has only 660k shares in puts with the same strikes. I bet that's going up! Doesn't matter though...BUY HODL VOTE = ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
