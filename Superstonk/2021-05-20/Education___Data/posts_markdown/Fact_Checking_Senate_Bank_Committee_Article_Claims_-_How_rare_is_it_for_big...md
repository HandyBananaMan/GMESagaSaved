# Fact Checks

*Real quick - links are posted in a comment below and are referenced by number throughout the post so that I don't get my post deleted by automod.*

I came across this post which had information about the Senate Banking Committee bringing forth all of our favorite CEOs for a special episode of "Pretend like we're doing something". The post had screen capped an article (1) which further claimed:

>We’ve been closely monitoring the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees for the past 15 years. **We can think of no other time when the Committees issued a joint statement to announce they were hauling the most powerful men on Wall Street to testify**

Well, that got my tits jacked. But before I let them get too jacked, I always have to fact check. So I scraped 🐍 the Senate Banking Committees list of hearings dating back to 2008 to see if we could find any mention of the words CEO and \[insert financial institution\].

And sure enough, these guys were telling the truth. **The ONLY other time all these major banks were brought before the Senate Banking Committee (based off the data I scraped) was back in 2008 after the financial crisis (2).**
