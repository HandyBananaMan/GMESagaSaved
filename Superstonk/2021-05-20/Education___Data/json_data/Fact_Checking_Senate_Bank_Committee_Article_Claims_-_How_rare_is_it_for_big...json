The post had screen capped an article (1) which further claimed:\n\n>We\u2019ve been closely monitoring the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees for the past 15 years. **We can think of no other time when the Committees issued a joint statement to announce they were hauling the most powerful men on Wall Street to testify**\n\nWell, that got my tits jacked. But before I let them get too jacked, I always have to fact check. So I scraped \ud83d\udc0d the Senate Banking Committees list of hearings dating back to 2008 to see if we could find any mention of the words CEO and \\[insert financial institution\\].\n\nAnd sure enough, these guys were telling the truth. **The ONLY other time all these major banks were brought before the Senate Banking Committee (based off the data I scraped) was back in 2008 after the financial crisis (2).**\n\n# More Results\n\nFor fun, here's some results based off of the below mentioned keywords.
