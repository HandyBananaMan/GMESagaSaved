<h1>Fact Checks</h1>
<p><em>Real quick - links are posted in a comment below and are referenced by number throughout the post so that I don't get my post deleted by automod.</em></p>
<p>I came across this post which had information about the Senate Banking Committee bringing forth all of our favorite CEOs for a special episode of "Pretend like we're doing something". The post had screen capped an article (1) which further claimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been closely monitoring the Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees for the past 15 years. <strong>We can think of no other time when the Committees issued a joint statement to announce they were hauling the most powerful men on Wall Street to testify</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that got my tits jacked. But before I let them get too jacked, I always have to fact check. So I scraped 🐍 the Senate Banking Committees list of hearings dating back to 2008 to see if we could find any mention of the words CEO and [insert financial institution].</p>
<p>And sure enough, these guys were telling the truth. <strong>The ONLY other time all these major banks were brought before the Senate Banking Committee (based off the data I scraped) was back in 2008 after the financial crisis (2).</strong></p>
<h1>More Results</h1>
<p>For fun, here's some results based off of the below mentioned keywords. Oh and let me know if you want me to check any other institutions or titles.</p>
<p><strong>Institutions</strong>: Wells Fargo, Citadel, Black Rock, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, and/or Goldman Sachs</p>
<p><strong>Titles</strong>: CEO, Chairman</p>
