    "selftext": "Citadel is a Market Maker and they're responsible for filling orders even if no one is selling that stock, this insures that a security always has volume. This is how a synthetic share is created. The MM fills an order and if they can't buy a real share (they can't we own the float) to deliver to the broker it creates a failed to deliver after t+35 (according to rule 204 https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). The Texas lawyer said that they will hide their FTDs by sending them to companies in other countries that aren't subject to the reporting rules of the SEC. \n\n\nThe recent Robinhood data proves (to me at least) that coming up with real shares is really difficult, Robinhood has to have a real share to transfer it to another broker. There are so many people that have transferred out of Robinhood that they are out of real shares and only have synthetic shares left. So, they're paying a $1,000+ for real shares in dark pools because they have ten days to transfer the share. \n\n\nIf Robinhood is having these issues coming up with real shares, then you better believe that Citadel is having problems coming up with real shares and they have to fill orders whether they can come up with a real share or not because they're a Market Maker. It makes sense to me that they are filling every order everyday with a synthetic share because we own the float and we aren't selling. Every time they create a synthetic share, even if they hide the FTD from the SEC, they still have to deliver that share one day. Basically they're creating millions of synthetic shares everyday because no one is day trading GME and they are still responsible for buying that share and delivering to the broker, it doesn't matter if the price of GME is $160 or $100,000 they have to buy the share to deliver it. Citadel is fucked.\n\n\nEdit: A synthetic share isn't a real share, it's just an IOU from the MM, it shows up in your broker account as a real share, but it's marked in their system that it's just an \"entitlement\" to a real share. \n\nFrom Dr. Susanne Trimbath\n\n\"But in a system wracked with fraud, traders engage in naked short selling, when they sell stock they don\u2018t own and never buy to deliver. So now there are two shares, the real one that was never delivered and a phantom \u201centitlement\u201d given the unsuspecting buyer which is recorded as such by his broker. And which the buyer can now sell! Because the brokers pretend there are real shares there.\"\n\n\"People who buy the undelivered shares get an \u201centitlement,\u201d and the money they paid stays with their broker, who can use it, interest free. The dollar value of shares purchased but not received is a free loan from the investor to the broker. The investors don\u2018t know. The broker is not required to tell the client that he took the payment and did not receive any shares.\"\n\nThis means (to me) that a broker has two pools of stock, real shares and synthetic shares. The synthetic share shows up in your account as a real share, but the broker knows that it just an \"entitlement\" to a real share. But, a broker can't transfer an \"entitlement\" of a share to another broker. So, they send their real shares and when their clients buy more shares they get real shares back from the selling broker.\n\nhttps://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/\n\nMy biggest take away from all this, this is the first time in history that all shares for a heavily shorted stock got bought up and held. This puts the MM in a very bad situation because they've shorted the stock, so they have to make sure the price stays low or they could get liquidated. They have to fill orders everyday because they are required to even if they can't come up with real shares, this forces them to create millions of \"entitlement\" shares that they have to cover one day. It's really the perfect storm.\n\n\nEdit 2: For everyone saying this was disproven because even dark pools are recorded in the NBBO.\n\n\"Dark pools and other alternative trading systems may not always appear in these results, given the less transparent nature of their businesses.\"\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp",
