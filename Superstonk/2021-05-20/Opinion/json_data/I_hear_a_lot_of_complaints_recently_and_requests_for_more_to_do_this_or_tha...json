When those dramas happened, it was uncertain which spin-off sub would emerge from the ashes.\n\nSuperstonk, the founders, and the moderators have exceeded all of my expectations. In my opinion, superstonk is the evolution of all of the others. They respond to FUD and shills so fast I hardly notice them. When i do, as pinkcatsonacid has said, it's that apes are smart enough to spot them and call them out.\n\nI don't think they need constant advice or proposals, as their judgement has been pretty fucking good!\n\n\nEdited: removed my agree question. This was not meant to beg for yogis. If you truly don't think they've done well, then we just disagree.",
