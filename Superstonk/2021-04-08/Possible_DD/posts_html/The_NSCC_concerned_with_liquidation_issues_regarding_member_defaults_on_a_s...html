<p>Disclaimer: I have seen evidence that this excerpt and filing could be unrelated the to the GME scenario, but seeing as the timing and the desperation in this segment is just too uncanny for me, here's my two cents. Links to both the original post and comments regarding the relations of this filing and GME will be edited into the bottom of the post. I'm marking this post as discussion as I don't think it fits into DD yet without verification. See edit 3. </p>
<p>Edit 1: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mn01iu/nscc2021802_just_posted_on_dtcc_website_is_this/">The original post calling for smarter apes to look into this and the subsequent discussion.</a></p>
<p>^ This post highlights much more of the NSCC post as well. I advise reading through that if you want the full picture. <em>DO NOT HYPE DATES</em></p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmzusi/new_dtcc_filing_for_nscc2021802/">One of the buried posts dumbing down the new edits.</a></p>
<p>Edit 3: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mn01iu/_/gtvozz1/?context=1">A direct link</a> to u/the_captain_slog's take and my reasoning for the disclaimer. </p>
<p>Edit 4: u/atobitt did reply in the original post that he'd look into this. Very spicy 🚀🚀🚀
u/rensole just in case. </p>
<p>First off, this it not at all financial advice. I'm an actual idiot. 
Second off: 💎👋 🐒 🚀 🚀🚀 🌚 </p>
<p>Now, this quote is an excerpt from a post that got buried under the overwhelming news today about Cohen's chairman status and the share recall. The skimmed down piece on rule changes regarding 002 from a recent NSCC filing update. This update and its details are regarding 002 and defaults, as well as liquidity issues throughout a specific time period that I myself will not hype up due to such topics being slippery ice. However, I implore you to read this segment. </p>
<h2>Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i)</h2>
<p>"Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) requires a covered clearing agency, of which NSCC is one, to “establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to … [e]ffectively measure, monitor, and manage liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by the covered clearing agency, including measuring, monitoring, and managing its settlement and funding flows on an ongoing and timely basis, and its use of intraday liquidity by, at a minimum … [m]aintaining sufficient liquid resources at the minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day … settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the participant family that would generate the largest aggregate payment of obligation for the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible conditions.”"</p>
<p>🚀Now I'm just a dumbass ape but do you see that last sentence? 🚀</p>
<h2>"...settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the participant family that would generate the largest aggregate payment of obligation for the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible conditions.”</h2>
<p><em>Still not seeing it?</em></p>
<h1>"...in extreme but plausible conditions.”</h1>
<p><em>THESE GUYS KNOW THE POTENTIAL THIS HAS. OUR FLOORS ARE PLAUSIBLE. I'M PRETTY DAMN STUPID BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE INFINITE RISK THEORY IS ON THE TABLE AND THE NSCC IS DEMANDING LIQUIDITY IF SUCH AN OCCASION OCCURS.</em> </p>
<p>Once again, this isn't financial advice at all, but I personally would love to see a phone number in my trading account and if you would like to as well, hold your damn shares and turn your fists into 💎s. </p>
<p>TLDR: The whole post is freaking confirmation bias read it all to get your highs lazy apes. </p>
