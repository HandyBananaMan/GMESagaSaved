**EDIT 3: THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN AS GOOD NEWS!!!**

The initial concern was that GameStop sold a bunch of bonds that have the option to convert into shares of common stock.

&#x200B;

This means an owner of GameStop's bond can convert (under certain circumstances) into shares of GME to cover a large short position, without being traded on the market.

&#x200B;

I have been informed by a few people that they **do not have a currently have CONVERTIBLE BONDS**

This would have been a VERY VERY SNEAKY way for short sellers to cover their asses without us knowing from the stock market.

Thank you to u/the_captain_slog for digging into this!

ORIGINAL POST 

Can't believe I didn't think of this sooner....

u/the_captain_slog any help here? Know anything off the top of your head?

A **convertible bond** is a fixed-income corporate **debt** security that yields interest payments, but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares. The conversion from the **bond** to stock can be done at certain times during the **bond's** life and is usually at the discretion of the bondholder.

Anyone know a thing or two about the corporate bond market? Can we objectively calculate this exposure?

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

* **Convertible bonds are corporate bonds that can be exchanged for common stock in the issuing company.**
* **Companies issue convertible bonds to lower the coupon rate on debt and to delay dilution.**
* **A bond's conversion ratio determines how many shares an investor will get for it.**
* **Companies can force conversion of the bonds if the stock price is higher than if the bond were to be redeemed.**

I know BlackRock is buying a sh\*t lod of corporate bonds because I incorrectly stated they were buying TBonds. Could literally mean a HUGE margin call through BlackRock when they convert those bonds.

Wonder how many of those are convertible?

EDIT 1: Or BlackRock and other bond holders could be converting them into shares and paying the HFs back. But they would be doing it outside of the market.

Q: Wondering if these are the "blips" we see in AH trading?
