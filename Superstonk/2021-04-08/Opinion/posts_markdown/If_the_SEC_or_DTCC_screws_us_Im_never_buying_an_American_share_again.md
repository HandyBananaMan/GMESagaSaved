Dear fellow apes,

I implore you to join me in solidarity to show the SEC/DTCC that any fuckery will not go unpunished. If they do try to fuck us, don't buy a single share. They need to know that we will. 

I am absolutely certain it has crossed their minds to screw retail, and they're doing so at current by not enacting the new rules when they absolutely could do so.

I, for one, will never buy another US stock if they weasel out of this one. They need to know the economic damage of cheating will be worse than what will happen naturally. 

And let me tell you, if you let them get away with this one, the next one will be far worse, and you will be subservient for life.

If they pull any shit, I'm closing my trading account permanently. Please show them you will too, and it should discourage them. I'm forced to play by their rules, and everyone else should be too. 

Yours, to the moon and back,

A. P. E.
