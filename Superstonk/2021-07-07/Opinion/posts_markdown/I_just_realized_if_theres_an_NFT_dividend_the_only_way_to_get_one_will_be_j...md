The MOASS starts when the dividend is announced and will last until short positions are closed.

Gamestop can't award the dividends until there are as many shares as there are tokens.

The only way an ape can get one (other than buy it second hand) is diamond hand.

How much of our lives have we spent grinding for achievements? I dare say this might be the first source of ape on ape conflict: who holds the longest gets the token!

I really, really don't think the SHFs understand what's happened here.

A digital dividend is the ultimate IRL gamer prize. It means you committed, spent time, and passed the peak of gains to get this trinket.

I was holding for fractional Hodlers to get a Lambo. But now... I've got my eyes on the prize.

Edit: Thanks for all the awards! Also, a few folks in the comments pointed out that an NFT dividend can't be a thing, but single purpose c r y p t dividend is the same in effect.
