# Title: There are too many posts saying "$X drop on just [low number] volume?! wtf SEC" Low volume can result in bigger moves since each order would be "weighted" more. How would you react if others called it manipulation if the price went up a lot on low volume?

Plus today's volume after 1 hour since market open is already approaching the average total volume over the last few days.

I understand seeing the price drop hurts but making incorrect complaints isn't a good look. And it's nothing we haven't seen before.

**Big movements on low volume is just the result of apes owning the float multiple times over and not letting go of that shit.**

Just relax apes. MOASS is coming. Trust in the DD and BUY and HODL
