Tagging this person because i see that they know their options / data manipulation stuff very well and hoping they'll chime in on this post. u/yelyah2

Gonna keep this post very minimal and ELIA less i confuse people more than i should.

^(The data here is from blackboxstocks and zerohedge. Each is a 100 buck subscription. The first service sends me end of day option flow data for the entire market that i use to filter for GME and make these charts for my own perversions. The second service sends me banks intra-day professional letters and customer communications that sometimes have bytes of information on GME. Also using a Fintel subscription here.)

**Random Goldman Sachs stuff from one of their Professional Letters (Posted in June)**

**My own Crap**

![How i see the cycles. More dynamic than static singular equidistant singular lines. The cycles are alive, you can't just put arbitrary equidistant lines and that's that. I think this is a more accurate version of the cycles, but that's just me and who am i to say anything so yeah.](https://preview.redd.it/snuslnqqer971.png?width=2437&format=png&auto=webp&s=57f950ae3f4a0767d975f09b3ef66088b2111f4d)
