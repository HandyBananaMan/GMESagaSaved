#Title: 07-07-2021 Stockcharts TGA: Volume nearly inexistent. MACD in the negative. The drop in price this morning may have been artificial, but it pulled us into what I call the sling-shot zone. It's where dips live. This is where dreams come true, fellow apes. No dates. Just buy and HODL. Love you all!
