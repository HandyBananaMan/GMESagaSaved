Guten Tag to all of you Great Apes across the world! üëãü¶ç

What a day to HODL GME! German markets set up a nice $4 jump going into US pre-market! Of course, with the bullish news of another distribution center, the price of shares had a nice dip. Sentiment on r/Superstonk remains very high, as this wonderful community repelled FUD attacks over the long weekend and emerged more energized than ever. As we look forward to HODLing another day, let's see where the German markets lead!

Today is 7/7, and you know what that means! Join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange!

###üöÄ Buckle Up! üöÄ

FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from a single German exchange and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18679994. There are sometimes tiny differences in price that are below the rounding error, which can lead to colorful boxes without obvious price change. I wrote a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post.

Many among the Diamantenh√§nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received a direct response. Over a week ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the originator of the series. I've been serving as guest-host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.

Diamantenh√§nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!
