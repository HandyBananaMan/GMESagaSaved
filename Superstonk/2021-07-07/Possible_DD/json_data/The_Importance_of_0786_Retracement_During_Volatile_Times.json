    "selftext": "TL;DR:\n\nGME has completed its 0.786 Retracement from the peak of its June impulse wave. This signals a change in trend, and confirms that Fibonacci Signals can be used to detect trend reversals on a macro and micro scale.\n\n**Introduction**:\n\nMost people in this sub have certainly heard of Elliot Wave Theory by now. Many of us smooth brained apes probably have little understanding of how to use this strategy of technical analysis to make estimates about our favorite stock. However, it is very commonly used by day traders, swing traders, and algorithmic traders to make educated predictions about future price movements. Because of its popularity, many of the traders who don't rely on EWT for trading, still learn to recognize EWT and Fibb signals in order to form an understanding about the retail trading tendencies.\n\nAll of this boils down to the fact that: the price is manipulated beyond belief, but the fake price we all see is still responding to trade signals! We all know that we have some institutional investors and whales that are Long on GME (Blackrock), and we know that they are using some sort of TA to make their risk calculations. Meaning, these large investors have a plan where they want to enter and exit this trade, and they didn't pull these numbers out of their tushies (shout out to u/Rick_of_Spades).\n\n**Volatility**:\n\nWhen a security is volatile, we have a different set of indicators we look for to tell us when a trend is changing. Normally, the 0.618 number is a very strong level, which pulls the price toward it several times throughout a cycle. However, when we observe an extra volatile security (GME), the level we look for is the square root of 0.618, which is 0.786. this 78.6% retracement is what we reached today:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gaps in Price movement indicate high volatility, meaning we need to look for the 78.6&#37; retracement before the trend reversal.](https://preview.redd.it/5y1x7lbs3v971.jpg?width=2551&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf6148569482a39f520c106810a29c77b5848786)\n\nFib ratios and GME:\n\nNow, many people will argue that TA has no place in our world of GME do to the hedgies and fuckery that's run amuck. I, however, would argue that although the price we see is fake, everyone out there trading GME need to have some sort of signals to rely on, if they're not an Ape of course. Not everyone trading GME are apes, and here is evidence that the price we see is heavily influenced by Fibb levels:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Notice how we finished a gap fill after the 61.8&#37; retracement. Also, the initial 0.786 level of the Fib extension was retested twice.](https://preview.redd.it/ga18mjwm4v971.jpg?width=2551&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b879fcf0c658120af81bbc4e7cf0d23d261997c9)\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nThis, my friends, my family, and my fellow gorillas, is where I must admit I have no idea. All I can say is this 78.6% retracement is BULLISH AF, and to Buy and Hodl. I am a smooth brain who is not an expert or financial advisor lol\n\nEdit: new [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ogdgjd/todays_price_action_so_far_fib_ratios/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)  today",
