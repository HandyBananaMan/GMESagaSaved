Hello everybody!

I hope we all had a wonderful 7/7, finally a date we can all agree upon.  
I am here to give today's update to my first post - [Insecure about the size of your volume? Don't worry, it looks even weirder than you think!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/obzyst/insecure_about_the_size_of_your_volume_dont_worry/)

Yesterday's update can be found here - [Your volume is still small, but maybe there's a reason it looks like that (July 6th)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of3vab/your_volume_is_still_small_but_maybe_theres_a/)  
And here is the link to [the post summarising the week beginning 28/6/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ockost/27_update_your_volume_is_still_small_and_still/)

**Explanation for people new to these updates, feel free to skip**

Obligatory - I am not a financial advisor, this is not, and should not be taken as financial advice. 

For those of you who don't know, I have observed that GME has an oddly high amount of minutes in the day with more than 1% of the total day's volume being traded (for context each minute should have an average of 0.256% of the day's volume). So I have decided to count how many happen each day, what percentage of the total volume they make up, and how this compares to last week's statistics (check my previous posts here).

Any minutes with volume of 1%+ in relation to the day's total volume will be referred to as **Majorly Significant Ticks,**  
Minutes with volume of 0.8%-1% of the day's total volume will be referred to as **Minorly Significant Ticks.**

**End of explanation**  


Finally, [here is a link to my DD from last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of8tvx/how_much_volume_are_you_hiding_in_your_shorts_a/) on why I think this is all happening - warning, unlike Kenny, this one of mine is very long.

***Now onto today's figures***

Oh boy was today a day containing 390 trading minutes where some of them were far too **thicc.**

 7/7  
Volume - 4,194,228

**Total Majorly Significant Ticks - 19**  
Total Minorly Significant Ticks - 7

**Total Significant Ticks - 26**

**Majorly Significant Tick total volume - 1,355,146 = 32.3% of the total volume for the day.**  
19 Majorly Significant ticks represent **4.87% of the day's minutes for 32.3% of the volume.**

**Total Significant Tick volume - 1,618,732 = 38.6% of the total volume for the day.**

**Therefore, the 26 largest ticks of the day, representing 6.66% of the minutes of the day, were responsible for 38.6% of the volume** **^(Hedgie manipulation is the devil confirmed)** 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how it compares to yesterday, and last week's 5-day average

Okay that's uh, that's a bit more than yesterday and last week huh.

Well consider my bias **confirmed.**  
In [my DD yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of8tvx/how_much_volume_are_you_hiding_in_your_shorts_a/), I came to the conclusion that:

The more significant minutes in the day we have, the more fuckery and manipulation is afoot  
Therefore, the more significant minutes, the more likely it is that the price is going to take a beating from Kenny and the boys.

Today was the perfect example of that, and I'm going to dig a little deeper.

The pre-market today was already very active, much more than usual recently. We had a pre-market volume of 36,201. Yesterday we had19,555 and on the 1st of July, we had a mere 9,243 - so fuckery seemed to be just round the corner. And fuckery there was.  
We all saw the very blatant attack this morning, dropping the price by $17.83 in just 22 minutes - months ago this would have concerned a great deal of apes, but to us now we see this for what it really is - 

&amp;#x200B;

That's right, ***synthetic.***

In all seriousness though, this attack was genuinely pitiful - and here's why.

This attack lasted 22 minutes, the total volume of these 22 minutes was   
1,130,749 (27% of the day's volume, 5.6% of the minutes)

And the price fell $17.83 - in [my previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of8tvx/how_much_volume_are_you_hiding_in_your_shorts_a/), I showed a period on the 9th of March where GME rose $20 on just 100,000 volume.  
I think you can now see why to me, this is rather weak. Each dollar we went down today took an **average of 63,418 volume** to do so - and yes blah blah blah volume has buys and sells I know, don't worry - however the same is true for the 9th of March, yet **when the fuckery is absent, we spike upwards** ***hard.***

On January 28th, they dropped **12 Million volume on us in 70 minutes, and lowered the price by $300** \- now *that* is an attack. Not only was the actual attack about 12x the size, but it only took them 40,000 shares per dollar of dropping the price, so **they are now less effective in every way.**

Special shout out to 9:58 this morning, biggest candle of the day, this big 148,951 volume boi lowered the price a whopping $1.55.  


**Once again, the message is clear -** ***buy and HODL*** **(groundbreaking strategy, I know).** 

**This is getting more expensive for them - and it costs us nothing to hold, sooner or later they will run out of money to play around with the volume like this, or it will become so ineffective that they'll have to give up anyway. Also, it seems to be roughly 10x as expensive to push the price down by an amount than it costs to push the price up by the same amount (based on an average of figures I have collected from the last week), so it's getting worse and worse for their pockets.**

See you guys tomorrow,
