End asset purchases.\n2. After the balance sheets quit growing then hike rates.\n3. *maybe* shrink the balance sheet after raising rates.\n\nThis approach worked 'well' last time because inflation was so low. As I have been arguing, that is not the environment we are in at this time--people's mindsets have changed about inflation, these prices are getting paid and inflation is running rampant.\n\n[brrrrr running hot!](https://i.redd.it/8ocr9xd80r971.gif)\n\nThe Fed is asleep at the printer (as all the other world banks taking action while The Fed had up to this point only been talking about talking about doing stuff...)\n\n[talking about talking about doing stuff...](https://preview.redd.it/mf9tqz3hqq971.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b352c4cc096fa9b42775d48bbff3cad1361bbae)\n\n# Australia\n\nFirst up, the Australians. First, some level setting on the Australian economy and why inflation is such an issue:\n\n[Also, courtesy u\\/joofntool https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=j2AvU2cfXRk&list=WL&index=161](https://reddit.com/link/ofe7s8/video/wemf6j9xrq971/player)\n\nAll in jest Australia, this Jellyfish loves you!\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.rba.gov.au\\/media-releases\\/2021\\/mr-21-13.html](https://preview.redd.it/pt1kqkwyqq971.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e8925007193dbf8011a41cc32a1f35cfcef2f7b)\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia announced today that it would taper its Quantitative Easing (central bank purchases securities from the market in order to increase the money supply), by reducing weekly purchases of government bonds by A$1 billion a week, to A$4 billion a week--down from A$5 billion per week.\n\n# Canada\n\n[\u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u201csigns of extrapolative expectations and speculative behavior\u201d](https://i.redd.it/2fsdbcrysq971.gif)\n\nCanada announced the first reduction in QE back in October last year, from C$5 billion to C$4 billion, when it also ended buying mortgage-backed securities. In March 2021, it started unwinding its liquidity facilities, citing [\u201cmoral hazard\u201d](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2021/03/market-stress-relief-role-bank-canadas-balance-sheet/) as the reason. In April, it announced a further reduction, to C$3 billion, citing [\u201csigns of extrapolative expectations and speculative behavior\u201d](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-bank-of-canada-governor-says-red-hot-housing-market-showing-signs-of/) in the housing market.\n\nCanada's balance sheet dropped from C$575 billion at the peak in March, to C$481 billion as of June 30.\n\n# England\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[an \u201coperational decision\u201d that \u201cshould not be interpreted as a change in the stance of monetary policy.\u201d](https://i.redd.it/k3pxmw5ctq971.gif)\n\nThe Bank of England [announced in May](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2021/may-2021) that it would reduce QE, winding down the bond purchases from \u00a34.4 billion a week to \u00a33.4 billion a week.\n\nThe Bank of England denied that it is reducing QE, calling it an \u201coperational decision\u201d that \u201cshould not be interpreted as a change in the stance of monetary policy.\u201d\n\nThe reason this does not count, [according to BoE governor Andrew Bailey at the post-meeting press conference](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210506583/bailey-says-reduction-in-bank-of-england-bond-purchases-isnt-tapering-markets-seem-to-agree), is that the BoE didn\u2019t change its \u201cfixed amounts\u201d of its overall QE target of \u00a3895 billion, it\u2019s just buying less per week to get to this target.\n\n# Ireland\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/01aqagf0uq971.gif\n\nThe Eurosystem is purchasing \u20ac60 billion of public sector and private sector bonds per month across four purchase programs. The programs were launched to address the risks of a prolonged period of low inflation. There are four purchase programs, namely the:\n\n1. Third Covered Bond Purchase Programme ([CBPP3](https://www.centralbank.ie/monetary-policy/policy-implementation/asset-purchase-programmes/cbpp3))\n2. Asset-Backed Securities Purchase Programme ([ABSPP](https://www.centralbank.ie/monetary-policy/policy-implementation/asset-purchase-programmes/abspp))\n3. Public Sector Purchase Programme ([PSPP](https://www.centralbank.ie/monetary-policy/policy-implementation/asset-purchase-programmes/pspp))\n4. Corporate Sector Purchase Programme ([CSPP](https://www.centralbank.ie/monetary-policy/policy-implementation/asset-purchase-programmes/cspp))\n\n\\*More information on the purchase programs can be found on the [ECB\u2019s website](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html)\n\n[Irish-resident banks\u2019 outstanding borrowing](https://www.centralbank.ie/statistics/data-and-analysis/credit-and-banking-statistics/bank-balance-sheets) from the Central Bank as part of Eurosystem monetary policy operations were unchanged in May and stands at \u20ac18.6 billion.\n\nBonus 'Fun fact on housing': Loans for house purchase decreased by \u20ac86 million in net terms over the month. In annual terms, the growth rate in May remained positive, at 0.6 percent, but down from 1.6 percent a year earlier. In annual terms, the net flows of lending for house purchase amounted to \u20ac451 million, an increase from the month of April, which was \u20ac408 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5rhwgwl5uq971.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7738f0d438213722037c36a27646d11514501dc\n\n# Japan\n\n[Bank of Japan is one of the OG's of brrrrr!](https://i.redd.it/vgzl6phmuq971.gif)\n\nThe Bank of Japan on [July 2nd showed](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/boj/other/acmai/release/2021/ac210630.htm/) that its total assets fell by \u00a57.7 trillion (\\~$70 billion) at the end of June compared to the end of May. Balance at \u00a5717 trillion (\\~$6.5 trillion).\n\n# Ukraine\n\n[Not a review of their central bank, but Ukraine working to lock up a strategic natural resource that will help their economy hedge inflation:](https://i.redd.it/g8y56ekdzq971.gif)\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.ebrd.com\\/news\\/2021\\/ebrd-supports-private-ukrainian-gas-trader-eru-trading-.html](https://preview.redd.it/ziubk3x1zq971.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0901b8ba8ccde62741a6f3dc004c4d67c85daf0)\n\nI think I can update this post as I find more central banks to update with?
