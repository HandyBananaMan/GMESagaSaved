If a members positions makes it so they don't have enough liquidity posted, Marge calls. If they don't post sufficient liquidity within ONE HOUR then they'll be snapped and their positions liquidated/they default.\n\n**Overview**\n\nOn 6/24/21 this rule went into effect. It's been a total of 8 trading days, so low sample size, but is beginning to show a trend. Since that time we've seen a couple of different data points arise that indicate the rule is causing the SHFs to scramble. \n\n**Low Volume**\n\nPer this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of2utv/i_cant_hear_you_closing_with_260_mil_volume_5th/) by u/edgar510, since 6/24 we've had 5 of the top 10 lowest YTD daily volume. Low volume could be an indicator of low liquidity and the noose tightening. In the past when we've had weeks of sideways trading and low volume, it's inevitably lead to a breakout to the upside. \n\n**Lower Highs and Lower Lows**\n\nSince that time, we've started to see lower highs and lower lows. Opening that day we started a run-up to $227, but ultimate got knocked down to a low of $211 and closed at $212. Only one other day since then (6/28) did we have a run-up go past $220. We haven't been below $200 since 5/24 when we closed at $180.01 and yesterday we closed at $199.56.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.nyse.com\\/quote\\/XNYS:GME](https://preview.redd.it/83mj8lexfs971.png?width=2592&format=png&auto=webp&s=3470659e635e54418e029b4b77022842b715a730)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theory/Speculation**\n\nSince the implementation, the SHFs have been very diligent about price suppression. We're no stranger to them trying to lower the price, but I believe we are starting to reach an apex between liquidity and their short position. Everyday they bleed money from their position, but are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either they use money to suppress the price lower than yesterday or they let it run higher and risk failing the liquidity check. \n\nI believe at this time, the cost to lower the price more than yesterday is less than the cost of their position increasing because of price. They may even know what price will trigger a failed liquidity, so spend the money to lower it further. For instance (completely arbitrary numbers), if the price today stays above $198 it'll cost them $10B and a failed liquidity, but to lower the price below that to say $190 it'll cost them $5B and another day. Eventually these numbers will converge as the cost to keep suppressing the price will outweigh the cost to let the price rise. In either scenario they'll be fuk and price goes boom. \n\nAnother aspect to this could be coordinated efforts to ensure smaller SHFs don't fail the margin call. We know $350 seems to be a big barrier and we always see a strong short attack when we get close. That may be the bigger SHFs (Shitadel, SUS, P72, etc) coordinating that. At this point, they may know the price that will fail smaller SHFs and work to ensure they don't fail their margin call. If they do, the price will rip due to closing out their position and put $350 in the rearview mirror, causing a domino effect. \n\nWe could see the price to continue to slowly trend slightly lower. This is also speculated by u/possibly6 in a recent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of4zjh/elliott_waves_gme_wen_the_fck_moon/) (*What I want you to take away from the above visual is in the event that our reversal doesn't begin tomorrow from today's low, lower bound of the channel comes out to around 175*).\n\nI expect we'll continue to have record low volume days. All until the apex converges or a catalyst causes the price to jump and the house of cards to come falling down. \n\nBuy, Hodl, and Buckle up!",
