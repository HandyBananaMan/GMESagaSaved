    "selftext": "Just noticing a potential psychological assault forming within this sub. \n\nA significant amount of post are suddenly cropping up, all of them talking about how they are diamond hands and their family/friends telling them they should have sold or they have a problem.\n\nOn any other day I would find this inspirational, but the sudden surfacing of these post all on one day raises my paranoia alarms and I feel like its phase one of a FUD campaign. Some of them are straight up saying their families are afraid people PENSIONS will be harmed. I suspect here in the next week or two they campaign will do a 180\u00b0 turn around and the narrative changes to they \"sold\" their shares and probably include somethings along the lines of \"im happy with my profit\" or \"this is the peak.\" \n\nIm not saying down vote them and stuff. They may be true but remember be cautious. If everything where what it seemed this forum would have never came to fruition.\n\nEdit: Got way too triggered too quickly, there are other posts similar to mine with earlier time stamps.\n\nEdit 2: Ape no fight ape, if you believe a story is real engage positively or just move on. No need to down vote either, the post might just be inspirational for an other person. Unless of course they are blatantly breaking a rule or something alike.",
