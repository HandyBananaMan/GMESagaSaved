Hello Fellow Apes!

Hope everyone is staying hydrated.

I wanted to share an archived version of some of the most popular DD on this sub, available offline in case any fuckery happens during the MOASS when Reddit decides to disconnect our banana phones. Here is the link to the PDF version of the archive with clickable links and easy to use navigation:

[Superstonk DD Mega Back Up](https://pdfhost.io/v/iIJ7hlGof_Superstonk_DD_Mega_Back_Uppdf.pdf)

This pdf is located on pdfhost.io

Each post has a hyperlink to jump to that specific content. Each post contains the original poster, within the table of contents, that also contains a hyperlink that will direct you to the OP! At the end of each post, there is a link to direct you back to the TOC.

Everything I have used has been credited to the OP of each post. 

Disclaimer

This is not going to be perfect. All DD is not archived. Only the most popular, or posts with most attention. Think of this as your 'MOASS Survival Kit' if or when things go dark. It's meant to keep your hands diamond. 

I tried everything my smooth brain could muster in order to keep the correct formatting of each DD posted. Some of the pictures contained in DD posts will be compressed to save on space, however, most still contain their hyperlink that will redirect you to the full quality image. (May not work if Reddit shuts down.)

If you would like to use this archive for something else, go for it! The only thing I ask is if you could credit the archive as a whole, as it took me 3 days to put together. 


Hope you all enjoy it. See you on the other side! ðŸš€
