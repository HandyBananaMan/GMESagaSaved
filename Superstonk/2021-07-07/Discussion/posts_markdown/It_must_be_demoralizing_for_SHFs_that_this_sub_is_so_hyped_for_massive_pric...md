#Title: It must be demoralizing for SHFs that this sub is so hyped for massive price dips. Can you imagine the broker interns looking through this sub only to tell their bosses that the Apes are enjoying this?

There is nothing they can do except to drop the price and "scare" away folks from the stock. The fact that they keep repeating the same scare strategy to "lower" the price with no success must be absolutely morale shattering for them. This familiar tactic is weak, extremely desperate and overall pathetic... what are you going to do guys? Short it some more?? Okay lmayo. We'll buy it up! Thanks!

There is no escape. You cannot get out. Hedgies r fuk.

Buy and HODL! This is not financial advice do what you want.
