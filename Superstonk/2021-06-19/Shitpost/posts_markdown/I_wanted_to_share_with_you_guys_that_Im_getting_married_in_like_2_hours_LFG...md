My fiance and I have been together for about 2 years, and engaged for about a year now. 

We're doing this now because we finally found the time in our hectic schedules to get hitched! And we're going to have it in our living room!

I wanted to share this because out of all of my friends, I wanted to share this with you- random people on the internet who I don't know.

I hope I get to know you all better some day, and that we take the greatest opportunity we have had in this revolving door of chances to do the right thing for a long time. 

Let's Fuckin Go, apes.

Edit: Okay so we're not *technically married yet*

The fucking issuer of our license didn't put her fucking name on the wedding license. The fucking judge found out right before the ceremony. I greatly appreciate the love I've gotten from all you apes today. God Bless, and let's go have a beer.

Edit 2: tried to reply to everyone on here. If I missed anyone, a blanket thank you to EVERYONE for showing me some love on what is the happiest day of my life so far. ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ On my new wife :)
