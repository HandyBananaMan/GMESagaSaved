    "selftext": "My fiance and I have been together for about 2 years, and engaged for about a year now. \n\nWe're doing this now because we finally found the time in our hectic schedules to get hitched! And we're going to have it in our living room!\n\nI wanted to share this because out of all of my friends, I wanted to share this with you- random people on the internet who I don't know.\n\nI hope I get to know you all better some day, and that we take the greatest opportunity we have had in this revolving door of chances to do the right thing for a long time. \n\nLet's Fuckin Go, apes.\n\nEdit: Okay so we're not *technically married yet*\n\nThe fucking issuer of our license didn't put her fucking name on the wedding license. The fucking judge found out right before the ceremony. I greatly appreciate the love I've gotten from all you apes today. God Bless, and let's go have a beer.\n\nEdit 2: tried to reply to everyone on here. If I missed anyone, a blanket thank you to EVERYONE for showing me some love on what is the happiest day of my life so far. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c On my new wife :)",
