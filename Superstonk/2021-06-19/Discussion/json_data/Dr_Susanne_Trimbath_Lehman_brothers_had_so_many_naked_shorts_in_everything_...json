Since they can just keep screwing with the ftd, they can short as much as they want because they aren\u2019t forced to deliver the shares. \n\nMy thoughts are citadel will eventually be forced to cover cuz after each ftd cycle, the floor is slowly rising and eventually they will run out of cash.

Just look at Jan, March and June, they are trying their best to drop it under 350! So we aren't that far from the endgame. What's behind 350 Kenny?
