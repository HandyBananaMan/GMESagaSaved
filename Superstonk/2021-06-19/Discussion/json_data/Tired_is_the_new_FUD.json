    "selftext": "Anyone posting about themselves being tired is just spreading FUD. Tired? Take a nap. You know what I\u2019m tired of? The crooked financial system having its way with retail investors and manipulating prices. I\u2019ve been an ape since end of January and I\u2019m not tired at all. My tits are jacked to their tits. \n\nPepridge farm remembers when we were down at $120 and no one blinked. PF remembers the drop from 350 to 180. If that didn\u2019t make us tired then how is a constantly rising floor and the head of the NYSE admitting price manipulation making you tired? Seriously have a nap. Walk your dog. Circle jerk for all I care, just don\u2019t post this FUD and hodl. Logging off and waiting is the easiest damn thing to do. Play a video game, smoke weed, sell your kidney for tendies fuck if I care just don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re tired.",
