    "selftext": "Im seeing quite a few comments today regarding the hopefully upcoming release of SR-NSCC-2021-002.Those comments state that **SR-NSCC-2021-002** will be active on Monday June 21 2021 which isn\u00b4t true.\n\nJune 21 2021 is the Date designated by which the SEC has to either **Approve, Disapprove or file legal action against this rule.**\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91788.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91788.pdf)(page 2 if your interested)\n\nSo wether this rule gets approved or not we won\u00b4t know until probably near the end of market on monday.\n\nPlease Remember even IF the rule gets approved (it probably will but expect anything) this rule would at the earliest get implemented for the next trading day but also keep in mind they can take \"up to 10 days\" to implement new rules.\n\nI don\u00b4t want anyone dissapointed if this rule isnt active Monday or Tuesday or in the worst casedoesn\u00b4t even get approved.\n\nYou will see here if there is a new notice either of approval or dissaproval of **SR-NSCC-2021-002**\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm)\n\nor\n\n[https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings?pgs=2](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings?pgs=2)\n\nI wish everyone a nice weekend and hope for a awesome next week :)\n\nIf any of this information is wrong please feel free to correct me.\n\nEDIT: I want to thank everyone for the Awards given even thogh it should be normal in a community to help each other out :)Have a great time everyone.\n\nEDIT 2: Made it to the Hot Page dont know if i should be happy but you guys are all fucking awesome :)\n\nEDIT 3: Some users ( u/rendered_lurker, u/BLOODFILLEDROOM for example) brought to my attention that it will be effective upon release.To clarify any misunderstanding i also like this rule implemented as fast as possible but i wanted to include every possibility on what could happen.\n\nThanks to user u/OkGas9917 who is in contact with people at the DTCC id like to provide this link\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1x5gn/continuing\\_conversations\\_with\\_johnjacqueline\\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o1x5gn/continuing_conversations_with_johnjacqueline_from/)\n\nIf you look at the last screenshot the Vice President of the DTCC says quote:\n\n**\"As noted in the filing we must implement the change within 10 days from receipt of an approval from the SEC\"**\n\nSo yeah it COULD take them up to 10 days.  \nDo i hope for additional 10 days ? Hell no in my opinion this could already be implemented 45 days ago but i included this to prepare for every possibility :)",
