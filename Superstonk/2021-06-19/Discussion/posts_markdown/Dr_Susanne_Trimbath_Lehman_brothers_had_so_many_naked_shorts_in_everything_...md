TDLR: The problem was never naked short selling but rather failure to deliver because they can naked short all they want but they will need to settle within two business days. Since they can just keep screwing with the ftd, they can short as much as they want because they aren’t forced to deliver the shares. 

My thoughts are citadel will eventually be forced to cover cuz after each ftd cycle, the floor is slowly rising and eventually they will run out of cash. Buy and hold 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙏

Edit one: I am not saying Moass is gonna take a decade by rather I wanted to point out how bad the situation was in 2008. Just look at Jan, March and June, they are trying their best to drop it under 350! So we aren't that far from the endgame. What's behind 350 Kenny? Just buy and hold💎✋🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
