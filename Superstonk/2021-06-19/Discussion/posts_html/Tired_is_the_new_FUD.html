<p>Anyone posting about themselves being tired is just spreading FUD. Tired? Take a nap. You know what I’m tired of? The crooked financial system having its way with retail investors and manipulating prices. I’ve been an ape since end of January and I’m not tired at all. My tits are jacked to their tits. </p>
<p>Pepridge farm remembers when we were down at $120 and no one blinked. PF remembers the drop from 350 to 180. If that didn’t make us tired then how is a constantly rising floor and the head of the NYSE admitting price manipulation making you tired? Seriously have a nap. Walk your dog. Circle jerk for all I care, just don’t post this FUD and hodl. Logging off and waiting is the easiest damn thing to do. Play a video game, smoke weed, sell your kidney for tendies fuck if I care just don’t tell me you’re tired.</p>
