    "selftext": "I mean, this stock breaks all common sense in investing. Im averaging up as each day passes and i still feel its a bargain everytime i hit that sweet buy order button. \n\nAs time has passed since january i have gradually converted my portfolio into a 100% GME based one. In the beginning it felt a bit risky, but for every great DD i read, it calmed my nerves some more and i honestly felt some FOMO and just had to buy and hold more to not miss out. \n\nNowadays i\u2019m so zen that there are days when i don\u2019t even check the live ticker. And since i have a price alert set at 50k it is in itself soothing, since the current price is just not right (the price alert is not for selling obviously since it is nowhere near the floor, but for cracking a cold one and getting ready for some real action). \n\nDoes this mean i have completed my evolution into a true ape?\n\nEdit: Yes, this is partially a repost from a post i made from a couple of months ago from r/gme (this was unfortunately one day before the great forum slide)\nI have added some text to further describe my current feeling. \nFeel free to downvote this as im not interested in karma but i wanna spark a conversation making other apes have a forum that can spread zen or helping apes cope with their stress. There is no need for calling me bad things and lashing out your inner rage at me...\n\nIf you want me to delete this, i gladly will, but just be civil about it please.",
