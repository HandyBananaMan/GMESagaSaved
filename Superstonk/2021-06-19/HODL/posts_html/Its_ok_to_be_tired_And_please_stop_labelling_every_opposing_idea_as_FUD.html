<p>I joined this fight the weekend of January 22. I remember getting an article about how GME had halted from circuit breakers. So I read more articles, and then went to WSB to find the sub's sentiment on everything. Then I became aware that this was more than a stock, it was a movement to take down the hedge funds, and I knew I wanted in.</p>
<p>At that point, the movement yet hadn't evolved into Occupy Wall Street 2.0. There were some mentions of people wanting to get back at Wall Street for 2008, but that came in the next week once everyone started hopping on board. I think many of you started your journey from the Jan 25 banana/snake post about short squeezes:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/pupk7c4dga671.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e98f526d2f7c4920735078061feedf7a62e18300">Disclaimer: This is NOT the origin of the term \"ape\" in relation to GME, but that's for a different post</a></p>
<p>Then in the following week I watched the biggest green dildos I have ever witnessed in my 6 years of trading^(1) get crushed by blatant market manipulation when those fuckers turned off buying^(2). And then I watched it plummet over the next weeks to \~$38. That was my personal lowest low from this whole ordeal. At that point, I had felt duped and ashamed. "Did they close the shorts? Why are the numbers so low? <em>Could</em> they have covered?" Even WallStreetBets, our home, became compromised. The FUD was awful and no one had answers.</p>
<p>But then people migrated to r/GME and we built a new home. One of the first things we did was fully adopt the Ape namesake. And then we came together in hopes of building a better world. Posts from all over started popping up about how every single person was going all in, with all their money, with all their heart, soul, spirit. People talked about how much they've struggled, how it's been unfair, and how they've been left behind. And within the comments was always overwhelming support. "We're here for you!" "You've got this!" "APES TOGETHER STRONG!" And complementing these posts were the beginnings of the most amazing stream of DD/memes/shitposting to grace the internet and it all started coming together finally for us! And just when we thought we had built this beautiful oasis, it all comes crashing down in a single night^(3)!</p>

<p>Now we're here at Superstonk and, all things considered in our journey, I feel good about where we're at. I feel like the Apes as a whole have a good grasp on what's Right and what's Wrong and we're able to keep each other in check. It feels like smooth sailing for the most part^(4) but with the flurry of news, DD, and speculative theories popping everyday, it's all taking a major mental toll on many of us. I've been with you through the highs and the lows and I know it's taken a toll on me. I'm fucking tired as hell and I'm not afraid to admit it. And this isn't FUD just because you don't personally relate to it.</p>
<p>If you're some super robot of a human being and you can just take a beating all day everyday then that's great for you. But I'm gonna tell you right now, I'm fucking tired. And every single person who isn't lying to themselves is also tired. I'm tired of corruption, I'm tired of fraud, I'm tired of everything being unfair and I'm tired of everyone telling us we're crazy for believing that society CAN be better and that society SHOULD be better. I'm tired of the media blatantly lying to our faces and trying to use us for their profit. I'm tired of human beings having to work 80 hours a week at 3 jobs just to put food on the table for their kids. I'm tired of teachers having to pay out of pocket for their students' school supplies. And most importantly I'm fucking tired of the elite playing by a different set of rules that <em>overwhelmingly</em>, <em>unjustly</em>, and <strong>royally</strong> fucks us at every turn...I'm tired.</p>
<p>And you know what? It's ok to be tired. We're warriors in what could possibly be the greatest class war in human history. And it's been a long fucking war. Do not feel guilty or ashamed that you're human and that you could use a break. I don't know what you need to hear to feel better about it, but I want you to know that I'm with you. I hear you, I see you, and I'm here for you.</p>

<p>If you're a weary traveler, I invite you to rest by my fire. This isn't gonna happen quick, it might not even happen by summer's end. If you aren't mentally in it for the long haul then you're gonna get burned out. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Go take a breather, go outside, hang out with your friends, have a drink, rip a bong, do whatever you need to do to recharge because it'll happen when it happens and all we can do is wait patiently. If you're tired, know that you're not alone. We're all here with you. And no matter how tired we all get, it doesn't change the fact that Hedgies R Fuk. So hold on, hold tight, and when we launch, rest easy knowing that you secured a seat on a rocket headed to the furthest reaches of the universe. And if you're ever in doubt, just remember <strong>two things</strong>:</p>

<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>^(1) And trust me, I had been trading TSLA calls when they exploded in 1Q20 so I fucking know about big green dildos!</p>
<p>^(2) This event is appropriately nicknamed "The Sneeze" for those of you who are unaware.</p>
<p>^(3) The Great Migration occurred on the night of Sunday Apr 4, 2021. This was before I had made a name for myself, but like any true shitposter would do, I made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mk9s2a/with_subreddit_sinking_like_the_titanic_i_just/">shitpost as the ship was sinking</a> üòÇ</p>
<p>^(4) A lot of that credit goes out to the Mod Squad, Satori, Knights of New^(4A)...thank you!</p>
<p>^(4A) Knights of New need to chill on downvoting my memes üòÇ</p>
