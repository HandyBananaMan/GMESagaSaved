# INTRO : 

As I was doing my usual end of the week technical analysis in preparation for my weekly DD I believe I've finally put all the pieces of the puzzle togheter. I could have called this **''ENDGAME''** or whatever but I don't think we are  there just yet.  


I also want to manage people's expectation as this is only my opinion and technical analysis**, not financial advice** or a guarantee by any mean, still I think it's extremely telling of what's to come next.   


 When you combine this information with Criand's latest [**DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0scoy/the_bigger_short_how_2008_is_repeating_at_a_much/) and dentisttft T+35 [**theory**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o155a6/t35_is_the_one_true_cycle_evidence_to_back_my/) the information and data i'm about to show you becomes an inevitability and a self fulfiling prophecy. 

   
**What is my theory ? üß†**  


 ***I BELIEVE GME is on the verge of making another spectacular parabolic move whiping out the shorts***  
***and in the process, bringing us into tendieland. Sit back relax and prepare yourself for take off !*** üöÄ

# PART 1 : Technical Analysis

**MACD** ( Moving Average Convergence Divergence )  


I believe by the end of this week / beggining of next week, the MACD is gonna crossover signaling the end of a very weak downtrend. When looking at the past we can see that GME **MACD** doesn't really like to stay solid red for more than 5 days and has been very bullish for a long time now.  


Keep in mind that it is a very popular indicator used by many traders and will spark interest in people who were waiting to get in.

 **(*****RSI*****)**  *Relative Strength Index*

As you can see on the picture below, $GME always bounces of the **39** to cross **50** (neutral) and finally **70** (overbought) .   


What does this mean ?   


No one is selling on downtrend except a few paper hands and daytraders, so the dip are mostly artificial and weak the stock always bounces back and create a new floor for itself.   


I think we will get a little dip before exploding again like we always do as you can see GME wants to  
break 350$ so bad, but it is being artificially kept down.

**Volume**   


 *Trading volume* is a measure of how much of a given financial asset has *traded* in a period of time.    


The volume we are seeing now is very similar to the kind of volume we saw before things really started to pick up, by itself it doesn't say much but when you tie it up with the rest of indicators it paints a clearer picture. 

&#x200B;

[Volume is similar to pre-january run up üöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/dkdskk3g9a671.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d7cf53e4ee8a132fa66bc780980b057f598cf9a)

  


**Uptrend**  


  "What happens when an **unstoppable force** meets an **immovable object**?   


I guess we will find out pretty soon, but I think this resistance is about to be broken the same way it was broken back in january, as you can see below the candlestick trend is very similar to the pre-january run up.

**FIBONACCI**  


is a **naturally** occurring pattern.   
The **golden ratio (1.618)** describes predictable patterns on everything from atoms to huge stars in the sky. The **ratio** is derived from something called the **Fibonacci sequence.**  The Fibonacci Sequence is a peculiar series of numbers from classical  mathematics that has found applications in advanced mathematics, nature,  statistics, computer science, 

**Retreacement :**   


 Fibonacci Retracements are ratios used to identify potential reversal levels 

 **Retracements in the 38.2%-50% range would be considered moderate.**   


[A retreacement to .5 is  B O O L I SH IMO üöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/qdy5nkj9ca671.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=4650224e4a44ce625f957b93fadf3156cfc8e9ae)

**Extension**   


 The **Fibonacci extensions** show how far the next price wave could move following a pullback.   


As demonstrated below, even without the MOASS **GME** had the potential to reach an all-time high of 1.6M$ per share. **(4.236 fib)**  


 in my opinion we could definetly say that MOASS officialy starts past the 4.236 fibonnaci or **1.6M$.**  


As you can see once we get past **2K$ , 27K$ , 300K$ and 1.6M$** we can officialy consider we are past all reasonable and possible prices.   


Don't get fooled if we reach these prices this isn't the squeeze so beware, people will most likely take profits in these area. 

[Even without MOASS $GME got insane upside potential based on fibs \($\)](https://preview.redd.it/6o4mc6xaca671.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f6fab74419d912053fd8a4b44bcdd2a40953580)

  


**ELLIOT WAVE**  


This is a scenario of what our road to margin calls could look like, I drew these quickly but if you want more information you can read this excellent [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwyj77/elliot_waves_and_gme_why_im_jacked_to_infinity/) by Elliot Wave guy himself.   


this information correlate perfectly with [Trading Sciences TA](https://youtu.be/BWNGUpy6_bI?t=70) on **ELLIOT WAVE** who predicted AMC's 75$ using this technique.   


JACKED !!!! üöÄ

#  PART 2 : Road to MOASS  (Putting all the pieces togheter üß©)

LFG !!!! üöÄ now that i've explained my theory using multiple indicators and other people DD and TA , let's put all the pieces üß© togheter shall we. This is my final conclusion , our road to MOASS. so if you are wondering **''Wen Moon''** this is how we could do it.  


 As for when ????? I'll let you know at the very end.    


**Once again ; WHEN** we get past 2K$ , 27K$ , 300K$ and 1.6M$ **we can officialy consider** we are past all reasonable and possible prices. This will be **MOASS.** 

  
As for margin üìû ? I think it's clear the area between 350$ and 800$ is extremly sketchy for hedgies, they will do everything in their power to keep us from going there. **They never covered, and they will pay.**
