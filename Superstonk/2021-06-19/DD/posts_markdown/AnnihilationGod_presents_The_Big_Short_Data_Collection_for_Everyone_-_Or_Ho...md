**!NEW CHARTS AT THE END OF THE POST - Updated 21.06.2021 01:42 CET!**  


Hey everyone,

time is running out for some people in the market and it's neither GME nor retail.

A big issue in this whole GME situation is a lack of data. Retails just have access to limited informations, sometimes non, but in generall not enough.

I spend the last month learning everything I could about data, what data is available and how to get this free data.

![Thx to  u\/hamzah604  for this great meme! :D ](https://preview.redd.it/xcsho42eb7671.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0885a916b7d0d61c585208849b267e5ee30a5dd)

Yeah, RegSho. Everyone knows RegSho. But the data just goes back as far as 1 year and thats it.

Really?

On the visible level - Yes.

On smart brain level - No.

I realised that the useable timeframe is moving on with the time passing by. So I asked myself - do they delete the files the moment they disappear on the webside?

&#x200B;

So I merged ALOT links in Excel, threw them into JDownloader and VOILA:11.551 Files - and a way more accurate data collection then Apes ever had!

&#x200B;

I extracted all available GME data and all available CBOE Data back to 2010, merged them with Historical Data provided by Yahoo, Nasdaq and Fail To Delivery and **made on big MasterSheet for every GME retail.**

The overall accuracy is around ~~45%. Means, 45%~~   **50,37% (recalculation at the end)** of all shares traded between 2010 and 2021 are displayed in the data. Its lower at the beginning of the timeframe, but gets better over time.

I already produced some charts for people with the excel-level ape.

I further organised my whole data collection, zipped it and **uploaded it on Mega so that EVERY FUCKING RETAIL has access to better data for free**, totally unrelated to GME. Its a shame that retails are getting no support - so we have to help each other!

One chart from the Mastersheet shall be displayed here to raise your attention for data:

![Because my first calculation was like: WTF GME? This doesnt make any sense - Should compare!  \(thx to the discord dudes giving me this stock names for a comparison\). The results are - interesting - And like: WTF?](https://preview.redd.it/63t4ssmvi7671.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0de8c44bc70e3f9977ac0f303e49a16a46baec9)

I dont know if this data set is enough to proof naked short selling with data, but if this is the case, I really would like this SEC Award! :D SEC pls?

**You can download the Mastersheet here:**

[https://easyupload.io/ogovzr](https://easyupload.io/ogovzr)

Contains all Information I could find for GME in the data sets. Contains prebuild charts and comparisons.

&#x200B;

**You can download the whole fkn collection ( 1,4 GB zipped, 4 GB unzipped - 22.734 Files)**

[https://mega.nz/file/ikgUUCRC#HxOl0afMatKWpmmWrYOBMwQgQwVU2MHgGSoG0p1uRQk](https://mega.nz/file/ikgUUCRC#HxOl0afMatKWpmmWrYOBMwQgQwVU2MHgGSoG0p1uRQk)

Contains my entire data collection  - have fun! And pls, share it with every community that could have use for this information. The data collection is about ALL stocks - and I think alot retails rely their investment on bad data atm. If you want to work with the raw data on your own, get Notepad ++  - makes it way more easier to work with this amount of data.

Thats the part a youtuber would ask for your financial support, but I have another request:If you make money because of this data collection, you already made a fortune in stocks and you are happy to finally have some quality data - **give some money to charity.**

I worked 4 month to get this done - and you would make me happy if your donation would be for a  **Children's hospice** \- because this is something that should be supported more. And I am pretty sure they would love to play some Mario or have a nice  stuffed animal of their favorite character.

**Let's take care of each other and support people who need our help.**

**Let's change the world.**

**Gamers and Retails United!**

Best wishes and have a great Weekend!

PS: I'll publish the link to the updated versions of the collection and mastersheet on my Twitter:@ Annihil4tionGod  or here at r/Superstonk . If you got any questions regarding the data and so on, pls reach out.

**Update 22:50 CET**

\*\*Add2:\*\*I couldnt accept that i couldnt find any stock so far with a negative quote like GME - so I made another research. I decided to choose the stock mentioned in this article I had read back in Feb 2021:

[https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\_id=224548&navigationaction=industrynews&newssection=industry](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548&navigationaction=industrynews&newssection=industry)

![Perhaps someone who already downloaded the collection could crosscheck this pls?](https://preview.redd.it/6ualqyhiba671.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc3ac5612b14a7869a9b5fe404a8dbf69a398737)

Add3: 20. June 2021:I have to admit that I did a mistake while calculating the accuracy of the data. It is 50.37% instead of 45% like i wrote before.

https://preview.redd.it/9ldmzz9g8h671.jpg?width=633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c13ed4b7597f89827a99372df4f0a83625e2917

I looked deeper into the data to understand the relationship between regular volume and short volume better. This is the result for the Timeframe 2010-2021. I am trying to increase my data collection tonight and will try to find out, if the balance had been positiv before 2010.

![Chart OSTK - I though it would be a good idea to use OSTK again because i already compared it above with GME. ](https://preview.redd.it/s4vay0et8i671.jpg?width=5166&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a1f4b2085642b9ca0efae345e97b161c1add7cb)
