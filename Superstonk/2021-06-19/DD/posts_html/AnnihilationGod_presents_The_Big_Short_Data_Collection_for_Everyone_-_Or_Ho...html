<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>time is running out for some people in the market and it's neither GME nor retail.</p>
<p>A big issue in this whole GME situation is a lack of data. Retails just have access to limited informations, sometimes non, but in generall not enough.</p>
<p>I spend the last month learning everything I could about data, what data is available and how to get this free data.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/xcsho42eb7671.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0885a916b7d0d61c585208849b267e5ee30a5dd">Thx to  u\/hamzah604  for this great meme! :D </a></p>
<p>Yeah, RegSho. Everyone knows RegSho. But the data just goes back as far as 1 year and thats it.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>On the visible level - Yes.</p>
<p>On smart brain level - No.</p>
<p>I realised that the useable timeframe is moving on with the time passing by. So I asked myself - do they delete the files the moment they disappear on the webside?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So I merged ALOT links in Excel, threw them into JDownloader and VOILA:11.551 Files - and a way more accurate data collection then Apes ever had!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/80vjjcijc7671.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dab806ac11059f3787a21e0fa79953e0de80c636</p>
<p>I extracted all available GME data and all available CBOE Data back to 2010, merged them with Historical Data provided by Yahoo, Nasdaq and Fail To Delivery and <strong>made on big MasterSheet for every GME retail.</strong></p>
<p>The overall accuracy is around ~~45%. Means, 45%~~   <strong>50,37% (recalculation at the end)</strong> of all shares traded between 2010 and 2021 are displayed in the data. Its lower at the beginning of the timeframe, but gets better over time.</p>
<p>I already produced some charts for people with the excel-level ape.</p>
<p>I further organised my whole data collection, zipped it and <strong>uploaded it on Mega so that EVERY FUCKING RETAIL has access to better data for free</strong>, totally unrelated to GME. Its a shame that retails are getting no support - so we have to help each other!</p>
<p>One chart from the Mastersheet shall be displayed here to raise your attention for data:</p>

This doesnt make any sense - Should compare!  (thx to the discord dudes giving me this stock names for a comparison). The results are - interesting - And like: WTF?</a></p>
<p>I dont know if this data set is enough to proof naked short selling with data, but if this is the case, I really would like this SEC Award! :D SEC pls?</p>
<p><strong>You can download the Mastersheet here:</strong></p>

<p>Contains all Information I could find for GME in the data sets. Contains prebuild charts and comparisons.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>You can download the whole fkn collection ( 1,4 GB zipped, 4 GB unzipped - 22.734 Files)</strong></p>

<p>Contains my entire data collection  - have fun! And pls, share it with every community that could have use for this information. The data collection is about ALL stocks - and I think alot retails rely their investment on bad data atm. If you want to work with the raw data on your own, get Notepad ++  - makes it way more easier to work with this amount of data.</p>

<p>Thats the part a youtuber would ask for your financial support, but I have another request:If you make money because of this data collection, you already made a fortune in stocks and you are happy to finally have some quality data - <strong>give some money to charity.</strong></p>
<p>I worked 4 month to get this done - and you would make me happy if your donation would be for a  <strong>Children's hospice</strong> - because this is something that should be supported more. And I am pretty sure they would love to play some Mario or have a nice  stuffed animal of their favorite character.</p>
<p><strong>Let's take care of each other and support people who need our help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let's change the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gamers and Retails United!</strong></p>
<p>Best wishes and have a great Weekend!</p>
<p>Your</p>

<p>PS: I'll publish the link to the updated versions of the collection and mastersheet on my Twitter:@ Annihil4tionGod  or here at r/Superstonk . If you got any questions regarding the data and so on, pls reach out.</p>

<p><strong>Add: I wanna thank SC - he helped me alot over the past months - this collection would not exist without his advice and support whenever I could not solve a problem!</strong></p>
<p>Thx SC!;) I owe you a beer!</p>

<p><strong>Update 22:50 CET</strong></p>
<p>**Add2:**I couldnt accept that i couldnt find any stock so far with a negative quote like GME - so I made another research. I decided to choose the stock mentioned in this article I had read back in Feb 2021:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548&amp;navigationaction=industrynews&amp;newssection=industry">https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548&amp;navigationaction=industrynews&amp;newssection=industry</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Add3: 20. June 2021:I have to admit that I did a mistake while calculating the accuracy of the data. It is 50.37% instead of 45% like i wrote before.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/9ldmzz9g8h671.jpg?width=633&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c13ed4b7597f89827a99372df4f0a83625e2917</p>
<p>I looked deeper into the data to understand the relationship between regular volume and short volume better. This is the result for the Timeframe 2010-2021. I am trying to increase my data collection tonight and will try to find out, if the balance had been positiv before 2010.</p>

<p><img alt="Chart OSTK - I though it would be a good idea to use OSTK again because i already compared it above with GME. " src="https://preview.redd.it/s4vay0et8i671.jpg?width=5166&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a1f4b2085642b9ca0efae345e97b161c1add7cb" /></p>
