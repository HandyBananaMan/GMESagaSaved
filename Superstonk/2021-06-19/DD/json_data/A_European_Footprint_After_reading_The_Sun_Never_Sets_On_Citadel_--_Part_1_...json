The company, which is also based in the capital, will in future control 100 percent of the shares in Berliner B\u00f6rse AG, as both announced on October 9, 2019.  \n>  \n>Source (German language, please use translator): [https://www.berlin.de/wirtschaft/nachrichten/5934420-3912379-tradegate-uebernimmt-berliner-boerse.html](https://www.berlin.de/wirtschaft/nachrichten/5934420-3912379-tradegate-uebernimmt-berliner-boerse.html)  \n>  \n>Announcement according to Art. 5 subsection 2 of the German Exchange Act: Tradegate Exchange GmbH is the sole owner of B\u00f6rse Berlin AG.  \n>  \n>Equiduct Trading serves as the full electronic trading platform of B\u00f6rse Berlin and is technically provided by Equiduct Systems Limited, a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 02937847) whose registered office is 50 St Mary Axe, London, EC3A 8FR.  \n>  \n>Source (English): [https://www.equiduct.com/imprint](https://www.equiduct.com/imprint)  \n>  \n>The Tradegate Exchange is a securities exchange specialized for private investors.

Nevertheless: 90 percent price increase since November 2020 alone and a stock market value of around 935 million euros is more than impressive. The investment story is quickly told: The Berliners hold 56.2 percent of the Tradegate trading platform, in which Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG is also involved. The number of securities transactions processed via Tradegate is currently soaring upwards that nobody would have thought possible.
