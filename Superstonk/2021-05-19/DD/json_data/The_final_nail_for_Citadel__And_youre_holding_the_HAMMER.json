This was to require more regular position confirmations and clarity.\n\n\u00a0On March 24th, the DTCC officially eliminated month-end reporting and changed this to daily.\n\nBy April 6th, DTCC-2021-005 went into effect, which prevented shares from being used as collateral within the market, multiple times. Tightening up these loopholes makes it harder for naked shorting to have its place in the market.\u00a0\n\nOn April 16th, the DTC-2021-006 Rule change was requested, preventing more shares of a company to be traded than exist, which is still in review.\n\nOn top of all these laws and regulations rolling out, GameStop also has a proxy voting for the shareholder meeting currently taking place. It is expected that GameStop will receive more votes than shares accounted for, showing over selling within the market. These voters can only vote if you own shares in the company, and a number is provided by brokers to individuals. See Wes\u2019 AMA if you need to know more on this topic.\n\n**Every name on a 257-page ADV doc that is affiliated with Citadel Advisors LLC has made the news lately showing heavy losses, extreme stress, or is doing weird sh\\*t (BofA/ JP Morgan). \u00a0 That same document shows 19 umbrella companies connected to Citadel. They are worldwide and the implosion proves to be nasty AF.\u00a0 Blackrock has been buying shares (not calls) like crazy. The same shares that Citadel has heavy shorts and puts in. Blackrock has been buying up housing. Blackrock has been buying shares in everything Citadel is short on. Citadel bought a crapload of bank assets on 08 before everything exploded.**\n\n[https://docoh.com/filing/1456739/0001806691-20-000010/DA](https://docoh.com/filing/1456739/0001806691-20-000010/DA)\n\nSection 5 Bottom right of the page shows them all. 7.7 billion dollars worth.\n\nThese are all sales.

Madison Dearborn, Ashler, and Citadel (and others) are all essentially the same company, or at least connected through bank accounts. \u00a0 Madison is buying up assets after Kenny's group of shorters f\\*cked those companies into the ground. \u00a0 We now know that this is 2008 2.0 but this time, with commercial properties.\u00a0 Ashler = Freddie Mac.\u00a0 BofA is now connected to Citadel after permanently closing a ton of branches.**\n\n005 rule shows up and Bitcoin tanks.

Thank you everyone who contributed. Hours of work were spent digging into this information with several brains. Especially that spreadsheet which is available for view. Thanks you, and cheers\ud83c\udf4c\n\nAuthors: u/Broad_Grapefruit u/Bloodhound1144 u/gmorgan99\n\nedit 1: please no stupid questions, this is a lot.. also, if the sheet links are not allowing you access, thats being worked on right now. Its simply the 257 page paper broken down into 4 sheets.\n\nedit 2: links should be guud :)\n\nEdit 3: thank you for the luv n support. For some reason this cannot get posted into gme sub... a bit weird, and VERY sus \n\nEdit4: 005 did go into effect immediately but was removed for formatting. This is expected to go back into place and be once again, effective immediately",
