I just want to say thanks to all the apes that check in on reddit to read read the DD, watch the memes and upvote good posts.

You guys are the reason everything isn't crumbling.

You can already see that the people who are too engaged are getting consumed by the whole situation and drama ensues. 

The silent apes are just as important in my eyes as the clever apes doing DD, because the silent apes are the ones reading and acting upon it without creating drama and tension.


So if you are a lurking ape then, **THANK YOU** .


Apes together strong!


**EDIT

I just want to clarify that I of course am also grateful of the clever apes posting the amazing DD, It is some next level investigating that has and still is taking place.


**EDIT 2

I see some people are taking offense from this post and I just want to again clarify that I am not trying to say that people who are engaged in the community are less worth than the lurkers.  

I was just trying to say thank you to some of the people who aren't normally seen or heard from.
