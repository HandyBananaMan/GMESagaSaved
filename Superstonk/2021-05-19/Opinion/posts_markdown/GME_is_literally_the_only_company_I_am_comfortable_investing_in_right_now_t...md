#Title: GME is literally the only company I am comfortable investing in right now. there is no other stock with this breadth of data or crowdsourced info. we have 250k people (+) searching for, reviewing and analyzing all available data and then sharing it. there is no other stock with this much info.

forget peer reviewed academic journals. we have 250k apes reviewing every bit of research. analyzing the company and the situation from all angles. online, by phone, at libraries, watching documentaries, knocking on doors, reviewing legal fillings. 

itâ€™s really a once ever opportunity. 

thank you. that is all.
