<p>forget peer reviewed academic journals. we have 250k apes reviewing every bit of research. analyzing the company and the situation from all angles. online, by phone, at libraries, watching documentaries, knocking on doors, reviewing legal fillings. </p>
<p>itâ€™s really a once ever opportunity. </p>
<p>thank you. that is all.</p>
