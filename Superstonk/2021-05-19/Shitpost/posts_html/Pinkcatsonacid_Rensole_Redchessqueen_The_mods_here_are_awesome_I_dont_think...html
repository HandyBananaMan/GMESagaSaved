<p>This has been a really odd ride. I was one of the idiots who joined the bandwagon in January when it hit 80 usd. Everyday has just been interesting, and I've learned more about the US financial system in the last few months then I ever expected to learn In my life time. Thank you all for being here, I'm not sure what will occur when this all ends, but its been a blast experiencing all of this with you guys,</p>
