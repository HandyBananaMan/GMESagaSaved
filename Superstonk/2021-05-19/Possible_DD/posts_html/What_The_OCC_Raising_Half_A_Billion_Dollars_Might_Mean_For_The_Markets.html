<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> The OCC increased its capitalization requirements by $588 million to over $7 billion after conducting its liquidity test, warning us that one or more of its members (which includes banks and HFs) may be screwed to the point their own assets, $6.5 billion, and its insurance policies might not be enough to foot the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Background On The Stress Test And What It All Means</strong></p>
<p>For those of us who don’t know, the Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”) is the “sole registered clearing agency for exchange-listed <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp#:~:text=An%20options%20contract%20is%20an,prior%20to%20the%20expiration%20date.&amp;text=For%20stock%20options%2C%20a%20single,shares%20of%20the%20underlying%20stock">option contracts</a> on equities” (AKA stocks). In ape, if someone wants to trade option contracts (calls/puts), the OCC ensures those trades are fulfilled. <a href="https://www.theocc.com/Company-Information/What-Is-OCC">Source</a>. While the OCC is a private (or quasi-private) entity, like the DTCC, it is considered “systematically important” to ensuring that America’s financial markets operate. As a result, it is subjected to a different manner of regulation by the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including requirements that it craft and implement risk management policies and procedures necessary to make certain the markets continue to function properly (<em>e.g.</em>, there is enough liquidity in the market that people can continue to buy/sell.)Three of the OCC’s relevant policies/tasks are: (1) ensuring its members (banks and large hedge funds, including <a href="https://www.theocc.com/Company-Information/Member-Directory">Citadel Securities</a>) have enough cash or assets readily available in case something bad happens to the market (like one of its member banks failing); (2) maintaining a Clearing Fund to help stabilize the market if one of its members does fail, so that the failed party can be liquidated (sold off); and (3) requiring its members to post collateral for their larger calls/puts in an effort to make sure they are not overleveraged (<em>i.e.</em>, gambled more than they can pay if they lose their bets).</p>
<p>This is important, as we saw during the 2008 financial crisis, because when banks lose their bets and fail this can cause a huge ripple effect across the economy, causing companies to struggle in gaining access to their money (or loans), which in turn causes companies to horde their cash in fear they can’t make payroll, which causes other companies to struggle to get loans from other companies and/or banks, which causes layoffs and missed payroll, etc. <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2012/may/liquidity-risk-credit-financial-crisis/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20in%20the%202007%E2%80%9308,commercial%20paper%20market%20dried%20up.&amp;text=As%20a%20result%2C%20funds%20became,high%20precautionary%20demands%20for%20cash">Source</a>.</p>
<p>In short, the casino (here, the OCC) has to make sure its players (the banks and HFs) have enough cash to back their bets and that it (the OCC) has enough cash to cover the player’s debts if they lose and cannot pay in full. Meanwhile, the casino liquidates the player’s assets and uses its emergency Clearing Fund to keep the casino running while things calm down.</p>
<p>Sidenote: In April 2021 the OCC noted its total options trading volume was up 44.9% compared to April 2020 (<a href="https://www.theocc.com/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2021/05-04-OCC-April-2021-Total-Volume-Up-29-7-Percent">Source</a>) and it saw a 52.4% overall increase in volume in 2020 compared to 2019. To give you an idea of size, in 2020 the OCC cleared 7.47 *billion* options contracts (each contract contains 100 shares). <a href="https://www.theocc.com/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2021/01-05-OCC-Clears-Record-Setting-7-52-Billion-Total#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20OCC%20cleared%207.52,and%207.47%20billion%20options%20contracts.&amp;text=Compared%20to%202019%2C%20OCC%20had,increase%20in%20options%20contracts%20cleared">Source</a>. Weird. It is almost like people have been hitting the casino floor pretty hard.</p>
<p><strong>Enter The OCC’s Liquidity Test</strong></p>
<p>Last Thursday, the OCC conducted a liquidity stress test of its members, and it must have found something interesting because on May 17, 2021 it issued <a href="https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=48718">this letter</a> to its members requiring that they collectively, and <em>immediately</em>, increase the Clearing Fund by an additional $588,378,155. If they fail to comply by paying their share by May 19, 2021, the OCC will draft the money from their bank. (Side note: <em>the date I am posting this is May 19, 2021 and the markets is absolutely bleeding red, including crypto, which is lower than I have seen in a long time</em>.</p>
<p>This letter made me wonder two things: (1) what was the Clearing Fund amount prior to May 17th; and, (2) who is undercapitalized to the point the OCC wants more than half a billion dollars on hand immediately?</p>
<p><strong>The Clearing Fund And The SEC’s Enforcement Action Against The OCC</strong></p>
<p>In digging for the baseline Clearing Fund amount, I came across <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2019-171#:~:text=OCC%20to%20Pay%20Combined%20%2420%20Million%20Penalty&amp;text=According%20to%20the%20SEC's%20and,%2C%20and%20information%2Dsystems%20security">this press release</a>, detailing how in October 2019 the OCC settled claims made by the SEC that it was failing to implement effective policies and procedures necessary to ensure that it regulated its players/members so that its casino did not run out of cash. Basically, the OCC agreed to do what the SEC asked (update its policies and procedures), to pay a $20 million fine, and to hire an independent compliance auditor to oversee its “remediation of the violations and subsequent compliance efforts.” That’ll teach them…</p>
<p>Anyway, I think I found the OCC’s Clearing Fund size from <a href="https://www.theocc.com/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2020/07-06-OCC-Implements-Phase-III-of-Financial-Safegu">this press release from July 6, 2020</a>, which references an “[i]ncrease [in] OCC’s base liquidity resources to <strong><em>$6.5 billion</em></strong>”. If I am right, this means the OCC conducted a stress test and realized that $6.5 billion was not enough to hedge against its player’s bets and required they raise the Clearing Fund by another half billion to a approximately <strong><em>$7 billion</em></strong>. Keep in mind the OCC operates its own casino, we are not even talking about the <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/">DTCC</a> and the issues it might be observing.</p>
<p>Okay, so who has overleveraged so badly that the OCC alone decided $6.5 billion (plus the player’s liquidated assets) might not be enough to cover its players’ option contracts? I know we are all thinking “Shitadel!” and collectively squinting at our screens, and I think this is correct, <em>however</em>, I think there may be something bigger to the situation.</p>
<p><strong>I Put On My Robe And [Tinfoil] Hat</strong></p>
<p>Remember how HFs tend to have insider information so they are often ahead of the trade, making profit before retail and other institutions can move their positions? (<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2016/12/02/how-everyday-investors-can-make-money-by-peeking-into-the-dark-pools/">Example</a>.) So if a major player – like maybe *<em>Berkshire Hathaway</em>* – were to make a major move, it is likely they know something big. (BTW, this is Warren Buffett’s hedgefund.)</p>
<p><em>Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F filing reveals that it cut its holdings in Wells Fargo by</em> <strong><em>98.3% from last quarter</em></strong> <em>(dropping from $1.58 billion in shares in January 2020 to $26.4 million as of March 31, 2021.)</em> [<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/21167749/warren-buffetts-berkshire-sheds-wells-fargo-chevron-stakes-and-buys-this-stock-instead">Source</a>.]This is unusual because Buffett has been investing in Wells Fargo since 1989, at one time holding up to 10% stake in the bank. So what did Berkshire Hathaway buy? <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-buffetts-berkshire-buys-aon-215958612.html">AON</a>, a firm that “sells a range of financial risk-mitigation products, including insurance, pension administration, and health-insurance plans.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aon_(company)">Source</a>. Bonus note, “Aon” is a Gaelic word meaning “one.” I’m getting a Matrix vibe, like we are living in a simulation.</p>
<p>So how do we use our red yarn to connect Berkshire Hathaway dropping Wells Fargo so hard after all these years? The wrinkly brains among you may already be a step of me, thinking: Berkshire Hathaway closed its position on Wells Fargo two months ago, so this has nothing to do with the OCC’s stress test. I partially agree and cast Lvl. 3 Eroticism. (You either get the joke or you don’t, let’s move along.)</p>
<p>The answer is: I think Berkshire Hathaway was responding to Wells Fargo's results of a stress test that occurred in 2020, and the OCC's letter merely reaffirms what the prior stress test showed. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201218005724/en/Wells-Fargo-Comments-on-Federal-Reserve%E2%80%99s-Stress-Test-Results">Source</a>. After last year's stress test, the Federal Reserve gave Wells Fargo, and the other major banks, until November 2020 to resubmit their capital plans (noting this was due in part to the realities of COVID-19, but I think that's just cover given the investments we saw going through the OCC, which presumably is mirrored by the banks). This could explain <em>not only</em> why Berkshire Hathaway divested from Wells Fargo, but why Bank of America and JP Morgan issued record-setting bond sales last month (likely trying to raise capital to meet liquidity requirements… which is not great news, if true, because it might mean they are overleveraged). Notably, I found no news about Wells Fargo going the bond sale route of its competitors.</p>
<p>I also think last week’s stress test by the OCC confirmed what the Federal Reserve found last year, major banks like Wells Fargo might not have enough liquidity to handle one or two massive short sell events, particularly if Citadel and friends fail and leave them holding the bag. As a result, the OCC raised its Capital Fund by another half billion dollars. If true, this could mean we are in for a wild ride when things pop.</p>
<p>Why? Well, look at Archegos, the margin-called HF, and how its collapse cost the banks lending to it billions of dollars. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-faces-banker-talent-drain-after-5-5-billion-archegos-hit-11621288761">Source</a>. The linked article also explains how these effects rippled, causing banks to lose money, be unable to pay competitive rates to their bankers, which causes them to lose employees. This is sometimes known as "brain drain" because the company/bank loses key people, thus affecting the company's operations until it can fill those positions and catch up on the departing employees' work (think Margin Call where they fire the HF's Risk Manager, who was on to the fact the housing market was about to collapse and they were overleveraged, forcing another employee to review his work and pick up where he left off... but keep in mind it usually takes A LOT longer than a few hours to accomplish this kind of task, but it's a movie, so...)</p>
<p>Anyway, Archegos managed only $10 billion and we saw how that cost several banks, even in the personnel department. <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1396619/archegos-capital-management-a-10-billion-fortune-smoked">Source</a>. Now imagine what Citadel Security’s failure will look like, knowing it manages approximately $35 billion, and is likely overleveraged for much, much more than that. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/billionaire-ken-griffin-top-10-160425844.html">Source</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In sum</strong>, the OCC’s May 17th letter may be reaffirming what we already believe: one or more large banks and/or HFs are sitting on many bad bets and the casino is worried its players will not have enough capital to pay up if/when they lose, so it is increasing its “insurance” policy (<em>i.e.</em>, Clearing Fund) by another half billion dollars.</p>
