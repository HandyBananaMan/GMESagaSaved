That would mean they're GME Shares are valued at 2,865,000. Divided that by 15,000 shares and you have an average cost basis of **191 per share**. The average cost basis that Fintel lists doesn't even mathematically compute given their total value and number of shares.\n\nhttps://prnt.sc/134x2bi\n\nhttps://fintel.io/i/metropolitan-life-insurance-co-ny\n\nGME would have been priced at 191 multiple times before 03/31/21 after the run up from 40 dollars in February.\n\nI don't know what exactly other posters were looking at but I don't see that when I go to Fintel's site.\n\nThe same goes for UBS Asset Management. https://fintel.io/i/ubs-asset-management-americas\n\n62,845 shares at a 11,929 (x1000) value of $11,929,000 equals to  an average of about **189 dollars**. GME was sitting at around that price before 03/31/21.\n\n**TL,DR: The average share cost was likely an error because it does not mathematically computer with the other numbers given in the charts.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I am an idiot and I think this is actually the first post I've made on GME besides commenting a lot, so if I'm completely wrong, go easy. Lmaooo*\n\n**Edit:** Dave Lauer also calling it as an error. https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ncj6q6/fintel_showing_two_new_institutional_holders/gy5ef9b/?context=3\n\n**Edit 2:** The post where Dave Lauer is calling it an error is also 5 days old. So it's been disproven for DAYS.",
