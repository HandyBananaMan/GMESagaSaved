I was going to rewatch parts of this after the Wes Christian AMA yesterday and saw it has been taken down. It says it is due to a copyright claim from Kristina Leigh Copeland the director but the original title said that the uploader had permission from the creator so who knows. 

For those who didn't see it the documentary pretty much fully focused on the mechanics of Naked Short Selling and those involved in the fight against it. It featured Overstock, Eagle Tech and Virugen and the damage done to those companies by Wall Street practises.

I find the timing slightly suspicious, surely the director would have been delighted with the attention it had been receiving. Perhaps someone else lodged the claim to take it down?
