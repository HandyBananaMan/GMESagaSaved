I’m just filling this space to meet character limits but as the title says is there a reason that the biggest DDs not being pinned at the top for everyone new to see?

I think this would be something very beneficial to educate, furthermore if this sub does get locked during moass then they would still be visible right away for all to see.


EDIT: Many of you are missing the point of this saying it’s easy to find with flairs etc. NEW APES with brain crayons have no fucking clue about anything going on here. We need a visible list at the top

EDIT2: Due to the 2 pins limit, I think one is the daily discussions and the other one should be a NEW APES WELCOME MUST READ and compile all the useful important stuff there by most importance. You could have the voting on top and worthy DDs below for example
