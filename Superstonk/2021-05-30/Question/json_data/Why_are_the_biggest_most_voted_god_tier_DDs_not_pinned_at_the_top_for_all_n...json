We need a visible list at the top\n\nEDIT2: Due to the 2 pins limit, I think one is the daily discussions and the other one should be a NEW APES WELCOME MUST READ and compile all the useful important stuff there by most importance. You could have the voting on top and worthy DDs below for example",
