    "selftext": "Yoyoy eTorotards. I come to you bearing good news surrounding the recent eToro FUD and shilling drive. \nToday, I woke up to see the sub being pumped by shills and FUD surrounding the Tilray merger and the news article posted eToro team. https://www.etoro.com/posts/0__entry__19ed9016-5e15-4642-be20-64b8dc9bb89f\n\"If an offered stock is acquired, the stock will be delisted and users will receive the notional amount of the acquisition terms.\n\nAs well, if the offered stock is the acquirer, nothing will happen and the stock will continue to be offered.\"\n\nShills are out in force telling people to transfer/sell on eToro and change to another broker ASAP before the squeeze. DO NOT SELL YOUR SHARES!!! As eToro does not allow transfers, shills know selling is the only way to get off the platform. And due to having over 1mil+ shareholders on eToro, this would be a huge gain for SHF if even 25% bought into the FUD and sold. \n\n\nAs stated above, this will not affect current holders of $GME as long as Gamestop is the acquirer. This is the most probable outcome of a merger. It would be downright silly for GME to merge into a new shell company after millions of people around the world have grown up to love the company Gamestop. Furthermore, in the last 6 months, Gamestop has received an unprecedented amount of free advertisement from both MSM and Apes(signs, billboards, airborne messages). Also, re amping all their stores with new Gamestop signs that shine brighter than the beacons of Gondor Why would they then suddenly change the company brand after all of this..? It doesn't make sense for them to do this. \n\nIMO, a merger is highly probable considering all the clues and hints pointing towards this conclusion. However, I'm skeptical that a 'reverse merger' will be the exact method. Generally, a reverse merger happens when the public company(GME) is on the bring of bankruptcy and their most valuable assets is the shell ($GME) which its traded under. This is obviously not the case for Gamestop due to clearing all their debt and raising well over 500mil in capital to push their company evolution. Furthermore, generally in a reverse merger, the public comany dies(Gamestop) and the private company trades under their new shell. (https://finance.zacks.com/reverse-merger-mean-stocks-1096.html) \n\nWith all that said, I am just an Ape, swimming through the world of 'new' on r/superstonk, trying to dispell FUD on the weekend and help the MODS in their brilliant effort to keep this community excellent. Theres always the possibility I am dead wrong about this. I have sent an email to eToro for some classification surrounding this topic and will update this post astoundingly when get news back.\n\nLastly, due to eToro allowing apes to vote which went against what their T&Cs state. They are making a conscious effort to satisfy apes, and keep on their side. They know if they mess things up, they will lose millions of valuable customers, and be pooled into the same category as Robin Da Hood. It appears they are trying to avoid this happening at all costs with their upcoming IPO.\n\nTL;DR - DO NOT SELL YOUR ETORO SHARES. Don't believe the shills telling you etoro will fuck you over and transfer out ASAP. Any form of urgency seen shall be taken as FUD until proven otherwise. Remember your training, we are all in this together(as independent retailers obviously) See you all on the MOOOOON!!!",
