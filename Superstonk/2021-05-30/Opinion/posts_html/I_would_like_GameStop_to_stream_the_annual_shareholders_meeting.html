<p>After months of cryptic twitter posts and near silence, it would be great to hear Ryan Cohen's thoughts on how he plans to move the company forward as chairman.</p>
<p>This would also enable the 300 million shareholders to all attend the meeting without having to be physically present! We know Berkshire streamed theirs and to be honest, those are ROOKIE NUMBERS.</p>
<p>Ryan, we know you lurk here. Give us all the opportunity to attend a meeting we wish we were at!</p>
