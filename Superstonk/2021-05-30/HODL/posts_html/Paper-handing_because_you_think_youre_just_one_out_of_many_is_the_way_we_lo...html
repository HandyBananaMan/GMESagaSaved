<p>MOASS is only possible if we ALL hold through 1,000, 10,000, 100,000. Remember that they HAVE to pay us, either the system has the largest FTD in history, or they pay. </p>
<p>You may think you’re being smart by skipping out before everyone else, but remember that you are never the first person to come up with any idea, nor the last. We have likely ALL thought long and hard about selling on the upswing. After all, how high can this thing go, really? </p>
<p>This is about your future. Do you want to invest in equities after GME? Do you want companies with great ideas to have a fighting chance in this market instead of being preyed upon by large HFs? Do you want to show the the whole world that the tides have changed, and greed will no longer go unchecked? Do NOT waver. Literally every single time any one of us sells a share, it makes us weaker. It shows the enemy that we aren’t what we say we are.</p>
<p>This is a bitter siege, and the hardest time to keep our gates closed is when we’re winning. Hold.</p>
