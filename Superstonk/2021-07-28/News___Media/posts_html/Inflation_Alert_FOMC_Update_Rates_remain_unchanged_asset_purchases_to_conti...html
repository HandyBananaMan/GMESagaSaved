<p>$40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. This will continue to depress mortgage rates and <strong>only continues to add gasoline to the inflation fire</strong>.</p>
<p>$80 billion in Treasury securities a month (with policy rates near 0%): represses short-term and long-term interest rates in general, and inflates asset prices and consumer prices, which <strong>further DESTROYS the purchasing power of the dollar</strong>.</p>

<p>TL:DR - The Dollar losing purchasing power + Inflation = Permanent Loss of purchasing power.
