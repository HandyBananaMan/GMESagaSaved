The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to establish the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 0.15 percent, effective July 29, 2021.

* As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: "Effective July 29, 2021, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  

   * Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent.
   * Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities by $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $40 billion per month.
   * Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities.
   * Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.
   * Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $80 billion per day; **the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.**
   * Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.
   * Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.
   * Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions."
* In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent.

$40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. This will continue to depress mortgage rates and **only continues to add gasoline to the inflation fire**.

$80 billion in Treasury securities a month (with policy rates near 0%): represses short-term and long-term interest rates in general, and inflates asset prices and consumer prices, which **further DESTROYS the purchasing power of the dollar**.

[While the rest of the world's banks are acting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okicjz/inflation_alert_bank_of_canada_and_bank_of_new/), the Fed still claims this inflation is â€œtransitory"...

TL:DR - The Dollar losing purchasing power + Inflation = Permanent Loss of purchasing power. Unless one of the many other catalysts triggers the MOASS, [I believe inflation is the match that has been lit that will light the fuse of the rocket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oe6i3l/tldr_i_believe_inflation_is_the_match_that_has/).
