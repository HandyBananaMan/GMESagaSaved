<p>The manipulation and corruption is so blatant I have no idea how US markets will recover after this. And don't come at me with that bullshit about being patient because the SEC is silently investigating. Guess what, while they silently investigate people have been loudly losing millions for months. We might be diamond handing GME but we are not the only people in the market. For everyone of us they are probably hundreds that have paper handed GME or any of the other stocks that are actively being manipulated. After MOASS there's no snowflake in hell that will convince me to invest in any US market. Buckle up and see you on the other side. Hodl!</p>
