<p>The announcements that $GME and GameStop had recently is massive news. </p>
<p>Firstly, rebranding the GameStop stores in Canada. This is great news because it shows that GameStop is able to make moves it hadn't been able (or wanted) to do before. It shows the unity and power GameStop is bringing to the table.</p>
<p>Secondly, $GME is moving to the S&amp;P 400 in a week! This is crazy, we've moved from the Russel 2000, to the 1000, and now this in such a short period of time! We are going to be getting a ton of new eyes on $GME.</p>
<p><em>Tin-foil-hat engaged</em></p>
<p>People all over the financial radar will have no choice but to see $GME on one or more of their charts. One way or another $GME is making it to the top of one of their "high priority" intel, and it's becoming harder and harder to ignore.</p>
<p>The only way that SHF can prevent the price from spiking and climbing to levels they can't control is to blow their load now.</p>
<p>But here's the thing, there's no way they can keep this up. Time is on our side, and time is a bitch of opponent.</p>
