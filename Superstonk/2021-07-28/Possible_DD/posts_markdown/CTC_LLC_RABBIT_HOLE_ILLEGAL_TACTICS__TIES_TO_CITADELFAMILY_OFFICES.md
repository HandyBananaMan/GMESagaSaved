Hello fellow apes! I am a college student ape and like most of you all, I have been diamond handing for months, slowly growing wrinkles in my brain. I've been granted access to a Bloomberg Terminal and have been digging for info on GME and something stood out to me. Please take a look at the information I am about to present to you all and I would greatly appreciate any input.

&#x200B;

**Bloomberg Info:**

Recently while digging through GME ownership, I found out that as of 6/30/21, an institution by the name of CTC LLC sold off all of their long positions in GME:

As of 6/30/21, they also hold call/put positions in GME:

Comment on  CBOE regulation: SR-CBOE-2016-082

"While we appreciate the Nasdaq's interest in clearly-defined open outcry trading procedures, the Firms believe that the questions raised by Nasdaq are not pertinent to the immediate issue addressed by the CBOE Proposal..."

* Citadel, CTC, and Friends believe that concerns/comments raised by the Nasdaq are not relevant and encouraged the immediate approval of the proposal

In reference to Nasdaq comment:

[^(https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboe-2016-082/cboe2016082-1439544-129951.pdf)](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboe-2016-082/cboe2016082-1439544-129951.pdf)

"Nasdaq believes CBOE's proposal has both competitive and regulatory impact to other markets, specifically other venues that offer floor trading. Nasdaq's request for clear principle governing the proper application of priority and trade-Through requirements to floor trading in standardized options would address this inter-market disparity."

* This is in reference to the use of PAR (CBOE's Public Automatic Routing System) :

"While off-Floor trading is systematically prevented from violating priority and Trade-Through rules, on-Floor trading does not have similar protections as it relates to Floor Brokers. "

* Nasdaq notes that Phlx's FBMS (Floor Broker Management System) does more to allow for "fair and orderly trading" through "consistent application of priority.

&#x200B;

The list goes on...... CTC commits all these crimes and are only fined a few thousand dollars....

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR - CTC LLC has ties to Citadel and BMO Family Offices. Furthermore, they have been let off the hook so many times with their illegal activities. Like our beloved Shitadel, they have likely been manipulating the market to wring profits for their wealthy friends.  There's a lot of shitty people out there. Thesis has not changed. MOASS incoming. HEDGIES R FUK. BUY & HODL. See you all on the moon. <3

Edit: Obligatory not financial advice. Purely speculation :) Ape knows nothingðŸ¦§

Edit 2: Formatting error with some images + addition of CTC position in $IWM
