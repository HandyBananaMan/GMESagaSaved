<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Promotions to the S&amp;P MidCap 400 have had cumulative mean returns of +9.7% from the time of announcement to the implementation of the change. Like with everything, there is no guarantee that this will occur, however, considering the typical price movement upon announcement AND effective change date, and the relative weight of GME to the indices’ total market cap (read: very little difference), my tits are jacked to the MAX.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>The promotion from the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 index to the S&amp;P MidCap 400 is a VERY different animal than the promotion that GME had from Russell 2000 to Russell 1000. There was never any evidence that showed any potential price movement as I wrote in my previous post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7qbds/watch_out_for_overhype_on_russell_1000_inclusion/">Watch out for Overhype on Russell 1000 inclusion: It may not affect stock prices as much as we hope</a>. </p>
<p>However, THIS time, there is significant data for the S&amp;P promotion that indicates significant movement in the price of stock that face promotion on BOTH the trading day following the announcement (in the case of GME, July 28) and the effective date of the implementation of the change (in the case of GME, August 4)</p>
<p><strong>What has happened to other stock in the past?</strong></p>
<p>If a stock is promoted from the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 to the S&amp;P MidCap 400, the day after announcement sees an average of +6.7%. On the effective change date the promoted stock sees an average of +5.7%. Promotions to the S&amp;P MidCap 400 has had CUMULATIVE abnormal returns of +9.7% from the time of announcement to the implementation of the change. From about 50-75% of the price movement that occurs up through the implementation date is PERMANENT and doesn’t revert back to pre-movement numbers.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean for GameStop?</strong></p>
<p>Since the typical cumulative returns is roughly 10% over the course of a week between announcement and implementation, this could provide the price pressure that might ignite the fuse for MOASS.</p>
<p>Look for strong positive movement tomorrow, July 28th, then again on August 4th. If this price pressure and visibility of the promotion to the S&amp;P MidCap 400 affects volume, even a little, this has a strong chance to be the catalyst we’ve been waiting for and beat the average positive price movement that has been seen in the price. </p>
<p>Unlike the promotion to Russell 1000, we will not be significantly net negative in total shares added by ETFs hinged on the S&amp;P indices, which means we will NOT see the same downward pressure that we saw in the Russell promotion. The relative weight of GME to the total market cap of the indices indicate very minimal change in overall shares. And if the jackedness of my tits can be included as an indicator of GME price movement, then we are ready for launch. Buckle Up! Let’s GOOOOOOOOO!!!</p>
