    "selftext": "Tl;dr - Angels in the Outfield is a top tier childhood movie. Also, following the announcement of inclusion to the S&P MidCap 400, companies typically experience a rise in price and volume. This write-up researches fifteen companies included during 2021 and their immediate performance following announcement.\n\nEdit 1 - added tl;dr  \nEdit 2 - added pictures for the smooths to showcase volume  \nEdit 3 - added more data to chart to include price change at end of next day and close of regular trading hours on inclusion date. Also, I used some crayons.\n\n# All Rise.\n\nIf you\u2019ve sifted through the memes to get here, welcome. After hearing the good news of the stock we all independently like being inducted into the S&P MidCap 400, I could not help but reflect on one of my favorite movies \u2013 the classic \u2013 **Angels in the Outfield**.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar, lil Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a foster kid who absolutely loves an MLB team that everyone has chalked up as a dud. He\u2019s been promised the moon by his estranged father if the Angels make it to the World Series. So, adorable JGL decides to **buy faithfully into the future** of the team and **hodl with conviction that they will turn things around.** Not long after, heavenly Angel Chris Lloyd shows up to answer the prayer and not yet too old for this shit Danny Glover is surprised every day when the team gets on a winning streak.\n\nWhether your one, two, four, seven or more months into this investment, there's likely someone in your life that somehow is surprised GameStop is still winning.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5aiuir1cwd71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=37521a3ed01aafcb14dd8ba88d861e6981a75e34\n\n# Rally Rally.\n\nYou and 500,000+ apes decided to buy and hodl onto the belief that Ryan Cohen, Matt Furlong, and the rest of the folks at GameStop will turn this thing around.\n\nThat's not just what they're saying - it's what they're doing.\n\nYesterday, with the news of the inclusion into the S&P MidCap 400, we got another sign that we\u2019re starting to string some wins together.\n\nIf Ryan Cohen, Mr Furlong and others keep sawing wood, we\u2019ll be at the top of the S&P 500 in no time.\n\nBefore we hop into new business, I\u2019d like to offer a friendly reminder that GameStop\u2019s quarter closes this week if you\u2019ve been thinking about adding some joy into your life. **Also, I\u2019m not a financial adviser. This is not financial advice. Do what you want\u2026. As for me, I just like the stock, JGL, and baseball movies.**\n\n# On Deck.\n\n**The purpose of this research is** to have warm fuzzy feelings while thinking back to childhood movie memories while seeking **to learn of the impact on an underlying security\u2019s price upon and following the announcement of inclusion into the S&P MidCap 400.** While I am myself waving my arms in full preparation of a strong end to the week for GME, the intent of this DD is to merely present research and let you decide if you believe.\n\n# Batter Up.\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find a chart of companies added to the the S&P MidCap 400 in 2021 and the following lineup of details:\n\n* Ticker\n* Announcement Date\n* Effective Date\n* Closing Price before Announcement\n* Next Day Opening Price\n* Open to Close Variance (how much did price move outside of regular trading hours?)\n\n\\*Asterisk denotes earnings relatively near of announcement\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Included stocks bat .600 when considering a gap up by opening bell.](https://preview.redd.it/tt613a3jszd71.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=817e2b309d50f948e2b54b8675a28daa642ebebd)\n\n# 7th Inning Stretch.\n\nImportant, but c*oming soon:*\n\nVolume changes: in general, there appears to be a volume pattern across securities added to the index that resembles:\n\n* Announcement + 1 = substantial increase in volume\n* Announcement + 2 = less volume than prior day, but more than announcement day\n* Announcement + 3 = boom\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Exhibit 1 - STAA](https://preview.redd.it/k3eksxpuayd71.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d0782d971d72878de1e2a8111d1cb1cebf23a5d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Exhibit 2 - NBIX](https://preview.redd.it/o9l65i1bbyd71.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=84f4bb656dc9ccecf85c5cf5842eeb918d6cfe6c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Exhibit 3 - NVST](https://preview.redd.it/mbq082fgbyd71.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=a034a7d28765b9d2cf650feca3a34c37a4080e6a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Exhibit 4 - G](https://preview.redd.it/9n8fdeurbyd71.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ffdb41f103d47a4b049a327e0e985d915ed694e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Exhibit 5 - ENV](https://preview.redd.it/ru6b3ytwbyd71.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f437ea6dc8c6b82a261869e4649856b24f5d8b6)\n\n**Notice anything about the volume right after an inclusion announcement?** <*insert Pam from Office Meme here>*\n\n# Final Inning.\n\nI know\u2026 this whole year has felt crazy. Some days I don\u2019t know up from down and sideways in my life. Yet, what I do know is that when someone asks me if I believe in a real transformation of GameStop, I say \u201cyes, I absolutely believe.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[No precise target.
