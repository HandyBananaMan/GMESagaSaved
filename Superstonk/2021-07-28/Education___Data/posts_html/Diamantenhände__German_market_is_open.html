<p>Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>RRP goes up, volume goes down, and GME is being transitioned from the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 to the S&amp;P MidCap 400. Apes continue to HODL with Diamantenhände, eagerly awaiting, well... anything. We're basically able to get excited about anything at this point. We know something big is coming, we know that many signs are pointing at its imminent arrival, we're gaining understanding of the tactics used to delay it. We continue to HODL, confident in the thesis and the DD. There is nothing they can do to shake us, now it is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Today is Wednesday, July 28th, and you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>

<p>FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.17962783. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post.

<p>Many among the Diamantenhände community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler, following their sudden disappearance after Memorial Day. I also am worried, as I had tried to make contact many times and never received a direct response. Over four weeks ago, DerGurkenraspler deleted their Reddit account. While this gives me hope that they are alive and well, it seems to be a certainty that they will not be resuming their role as the curator of the series. I've been serving as host since their unexpected absence began and I intend to continue to post updates, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and sincerely thank them for the effort they put into building the worldwide community that lives on.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!</p>
