The website includes a message inviting engineers, designers, gamers, marketers, and community leaders to join the video-game retailer's team.It also posted a link to an ethereum address, suggesting it would base its platform on the blockchain technology. NFTs, a type of digital asset, exploded in popularity during the pandemic as enthusiasts and investors scrambled to spend enormous sums of money on items that exist only online.\n\nGaming is a natural fit for NFTs, given that gamers are already accustomed to buying in-game virtual assets like skins, currency and more to up the ante. The most popular NFTs have been known to sell for tens of millions of dollars. A GameStop NFT could generate some excitement both in the blockchain industry and among traditional gamers, which has the potential to spill over into the stock to give it a much-needed jolt.\n\n--- \n\n\n\n*\"Shorts covered/closed back in January.

Who will be the next new hire? What will be the next catalyst? Even without a catalyst, based on the hires and business direction/model, this stock is soaring higher than anything we've seen before.
