There was zero liquidity for 2 days, but they magically find 1,000,000 shares to sell in the opening hour?\n\nSeems legit.\n\nIf 1,000,000 shares being sold only drops the price by $10... just wait til they see what happens when 1,000,000 shares of buys all come in...\n\nThe lower the price goes, the better the chance of a whale/firm buying in large because there's no further downside.\n\nKenny and the boys are fighting a losing battle...\n\n**Edit**: I don't think you are understanding that we just absorbed an ENTIRE DAYS worth of selling pressure in a single hour and we didn't even lose 10%... We just absorbed 1.25% of the entire share amount of GME in an hour...\n\nIt's over. They can't sink the boat. Today, they just took their shot...",
