<p>...and price goes down.</p>

<p>They've been saving these shorts for days to dump on us. There was zero liquidity for 2 days, but they magically find 1,000,000 shares to sell in the opening hour?</p>
<p>Seems legit.</p>
<p>If 1,000,000 shares being sold only drops the price by $10... just wait til they see what happens when 1,000,000 shares of buys all come in...</p>
<p>The lower the price goes, the better the chance of a whale/firm buying in large because there's no further downside.</p>
<p>Kenny and the boys are fighting a losing battle...</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I don't think you are understanding that we just absorbed an ENTIRE DAYS worth of selling pressure in a single hour and we didn't even lose 10%... We just absorbed 1.25% of the entire share amount of GME in an hour...</p>
<p>It's over. They can't sink the boat. Today, they just took their shot...</p>
