# **GameStop is building an NFT platform as part of an ambitious plan to transform itself into the Amazon of gaming**

GameStop launched a website this week that says it's hiring a team to build a platform for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The website includes a message inviting engineers, designers, gamers, marketers, and community leaders to join the video-game retailer's team.It also posted a link to an ethereum address, suggesting it would base its platform on the blockchain technology. NFTs, a type of digital asset, exploded in popularity during the pandemic as enthusiasts and investors scrambled to spend enormous sums of money on items that exist only online.

Gaming is a natural fit for NFTs, given that gamers are already accustomed to buying in-game virtual assets like skins, currency and more to up the ante. The most popular NFTs have been known to sell for tens of millions of dollars. A GameStop NFT could generate some excitement both in the blockchain industry and among traditional gamers, which has the potential to spill over into the stock to give it a much-needed jolt.

*"Shorts covered/closed back in January. The stock is clearly spiraling back down to $50 / share"* 

#**If shorts covered/closed, then why do they continue to short the stock DAILY?**

After months of almost zero movement, who the fuck decides to wake up and sell the stock after fortuitous, bullish news?

The answer is ABSOLUTELY NO ONE

Ask yourselves this: If the shorts covered/closed in January, then why the fuck are they still shorting the stock?

#**Block out the FUD while we wait for the next big piece of news**

Anyone that tells you that Gamestop isn't going anywhere or is a worthless "meme" stock literally has no idea what they are talking about. 

What will the next piece of news be? Who will be the next new hire? What will be the next catalyst? Even without a catalyst, based on the hires and business direction/model, this stock is soaring higher than anything we've seen before. You and your grandma better buckle the fuck up.
