<p>I got a RemindMe notification of some comments I made arguing with someone about how GameStop was going to do really well and how it was going to reach a far higher fair value than people were suggesting at the time. This was during the beginning of the GME's first run up when GME was just at $40 or so</p>

<p>Keep in mind that my comments here were based on the information at the time, which suggested that GameStop should have a fair value stock price lower than I think it should now. If I were to give a different price target for GameStop post-squeeze, I would now say that GameStop is worth at least $500 a share, and I am sure it will accrue more value as RC implements his strategy and continues to grow the company.</p>
<p>Back then all the shills were saying that GME was worth no more than $20. And here we are, and GameStop has maintained strong floors at 150, 160, and now is establishing higher floors still. And these prices are HIGHLY suppressed.</p>
<p>People will continue to egregiously disvalue GameStop in an effort to scare people away. Don't listen. Short-squeeze aside, GameStop is a strong fundamental value company that should be evaluated much higher than it is currently</p>
