    "selftext": "My friend and I have a rule for buying new games that come out these days. We say that we have to play the game for 1 hour for every dollar the game costs in order to get our worth out of it. So a 60 dollar game needs 60 hours of gameplay to be worth the purchase. A 30 dollar game needs 30 hours, etc.  \n\n\nI bought a share months ago at around 200. I think it's like 220 or something, I honestly couldn't tell you. But through all the memes I've read, wrinkles I've added to my brain reading DD, etc., I've gotten my 200 dollars worth of enjoyment out of this saga. The price could literally drop to 0 and I'll still say \"damn that was money well spent\" and then hop on dota 2 and add my 16,000th hour without a care in the world.   \n\n\nI'm never selling. Maybe not ever, even after the MOASS. It literally wouldn't affect my day-tp-day budget whatsoever, the money has already been written off as \"well spent, worth doing again\".\n\nGoodbye.",
