I got a RemindMe notification of some comments I made arguing with someone about how GameStop was going to do really well and how it was going to reach a far higher fair value than people were suggesting at the time. This was during the beginning of the GME's first run up when GME was just at $40 or so

Keep in mind that my comments here were based on the information at the time, which suggested that GameStop should have a fair value stock price lower than I think it should now. If I were to give a different price target for GameStop post-squeeze, I would now say that GameStop is worth at least $500 a share, and I am sure it will accrue more value as RC implements his strategy and continues to grow the company.

Back then all the shills were saying that GME was worth no more than $20. And here we are, and GameStop has maintained strong floors at 150, 160, and now is establishing higher floors still. And these prices are HIGHLY suppressed.

People will continue to egregiously disvalue GameStop in an effort to scare people away. Don't listen. Short-squeeze aside, GameStop is a strong fundamental value company that should be evaluated much higher than it is currently
