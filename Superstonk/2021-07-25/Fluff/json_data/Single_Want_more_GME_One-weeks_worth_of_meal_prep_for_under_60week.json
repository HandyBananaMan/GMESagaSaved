    "selftext": "TLDR; I\u2019m a mom and seeing y\u2019all eating ramen is stressing me the fuck out. The vast majority of our ape brethren are likely men, so I\u2019m here to help.\n\nMy kids are with their dad for the Summer, so I\u2019ve been on a strict diet of \u2018fuck everything else, buy more GME.\u2019 No bullshit. I haven\u2019t gotten my nails done in months and I\u2019m eating the same damn thing everyday. Post-MOASS, I\u2019ll be feasting on ribeye and filet marinated in the tears of the wealthy elite. Until then\u2026 \n\nBreakfast \n\nSmoothies: \n\n\ud83d\ude80 Bag of frozen fruit ($5-$10)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 One large carton of vanilla yogurt ($2.50)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 One bag spinach ($2.00)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 One carton of plain oats ($2.00)\n\nTotal: $16.50\n\nBlend one cup frozen fruit (no need for ice), 1/4 cup of yogurt, 1/4 cup old fashion oats (uncooked), handful of spinach, and add water or juice. Boom. Breakfast smoothie.\n\nTired of smoothies? Cook the oatmeal and add honey, fresh fruit, and/or brown sugar. Boom. Healthy oatmeal.\n\nOR \n\n\ud83d\ude80 One dozen eggs ($2.50)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 One loaf of whole wheat bread ($2.00)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Bag of grapes ($3.50)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Bunch of bananas ($3.00)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Box of blueberries ($1.50 \n\nTotal: $12.50\n\nDon\u2019t like smoothies? Great, you save $17.00 and boom... Eggs, toast, OR French toast and fresh fruit.\n\nLunch AND dinner:\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Big ass bag of rice (brown, basmati, white, whatever\u2026 I buy basmati\u2026 $8.00)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Two cartons of low-sodium chicken or beef stock ($2.50/ea, $5)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 A bag of beans (black, red, garbanzo, whatever\u2026 I buy garbanzo) ($1.29)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 A large bag of frozen vegetables (I buy broccoli florets or mixed\u2026 $2.50)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Three avocados (@ $1.50/ea, $4.50)\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Meat (optional).. I buy ground turkey or ground chicken ($5.00-$7.00)\n\nTotal: $28.29\n\nGrand total: $57.29\n\nPro tip: use chicken or beef stock instead of water to cook the rice. More flavor and it\u2019s delicious. Cook your meat with salt/pepper/whatever, steam your veggies (you can cook your spinach and throw that in, too) cut up half of an avocado (when ready to eat. They go bad quick), and toss on top. \n\nYou\u2019ll spend under $100/mo if you buy the rice, oats, bread, eggs and meat in bulk. Frozen fruit can be expensive (fresh fruit is fine) but don\u2019t spend more than $10/bag. \n\nPros: These items are extremely versatile, easy to make, and will last you all week - if not longer. Budget-friendly and a million times better for you than ramen (high sodium content). Also, MORE GME.\n\nCons: You\u2019ll never want to eat a single grain of rice again when this is over. \n\nIf you have other healthy meal suggestions, drop them in the comments. \n\nTake care of yourselves. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not worthy, but thanks for the awards. Legitimately want everyone here to be happy and healthy. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSuggestions from our ape brothers and sisters added are in the comments. \n\nu/bvttfvcker (lmfao, I love this sub): Tired of Rice and wanna treat yourself to some protein? Quinoa is fuckin hella cheap as well.\n\nu/PollutionNice7392: Ever try boiling an old boot?\n\nu/KateSoundsGood: Protip. When cooking rice with stock dont use more salt. Stocks has plenty.\n\nI also cook grits with stock. \n\nMmmmm. Soooooo good.\n\nMainly use veggie stock.\n\nu/PrecariouslyLevel: Also, make sure you add garlic. Butter garlic sticky rice (I use medium grain) is great stuff even when you're not trying to budget.\n\nPotatoes are cheap, filling and HIGHLY nutritious.  You can live for months at a time on just potatoes -- the longest I did was three months, but then I had to break for travel.  Add a little dairy and you've got a diet that supported people in great health for hundreds of years.  I'll blow a couple of extra pennies to keep up on the nutrition side.",
