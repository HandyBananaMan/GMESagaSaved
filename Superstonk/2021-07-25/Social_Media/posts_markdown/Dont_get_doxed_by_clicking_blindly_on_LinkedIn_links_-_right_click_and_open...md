Hi fellow apes,

A lot of you like me who actively use LinkedIn to track jobs, present/past co-workers etc. have "remember me" sign-in option on LinkedIn like most social media. Unless you have your LinkedIn profile setup to not share that you viewed someone's profile (you won't know who sees yours as well) then you can be easily doxed by just viewing someone's profile.

Be careful out there, have a good weekend.
