Good Evening Apes!

So I ended up with a lot more on my plate than expected this weekend and am in kind of a rush to get this out. I had some family medical things to deal with and some computer issues. So this weeks version may be a bit more succinct than I would have liked. But suffice to say this week was pretty similar to last weeks in the way ITM options were being used to drive the price down.

I will probably add some additional information into the daily posts as the week plays out to keep everyone up to speed on the things I'm looking at. Most of the trends here we have been following for a couple weeks already so you guys should be pretty familiar.

As always I will post a consolidated [Video DD of this on my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial) for those of you that don't have the time to read through this, or have visual impairments/reading comprehension issues. This will be uploaded by...

11pm EDT/UTC-4. (Sorry for the delay here, I know the visual/audio representation is important for a lot of you)

# Part I: Technical Analysis

**Section 1: Ascending Triangle**

This is the trend we have been following the last couple weeks. This week we continued to chop along that 180 resistance. We had our two lowest volume days this year on Thursday and Friday. Ending another week slightly below max pain however the strength of the weighted VWAP that I introduced last week has really continued to prove where apes hold the floor of this thing.

![Ascending Triangle on 1D Timescale](https://preview.redd.it/w6ky00qyxfd71.png?width=2460&format=png&auto=webp&s=6671be7d80cf1b715284bcfe457a827d854e9786)

Friday we bounced off that weighted VWAP and started heading up I think this trend could continue and expect similar action this Tuesday that we saw last week ($20 price increase on 3m volume) as market makers once again are forced to cover their Gamma Exposure. I expect price action to look something like this.

As long as week repeat last weeks trend as market makers are still forced into the same t+2 for those closed contracts. I expect we will repeat last weeks Monday-Tuesday price action at a minimum. Which lines up well with our bounce off weighted VWAP for a test of 200 and a possible break through. Volumetric breakthroughs at 200 in the past have been very good for GME.

**Section 2: Other Indicators**

**MACD**

So I've seen a bunch of posts say MACD has crossed on the daily. This is technically not true go into pre-market tomorrow. Although the signal line is touching they have yet to perform a crossover but if we see the action I expect Monday and Tuesday we will see a crossover. This indicates we should be seeing a period of higher volatility occur this coming week. Remember this is a trailing indicator if the price trends down against expectations this event will be delayed further.

**Stochastic RSI**

So I smoothed out the StochRSI  a little bit. Lack of volume these last few weeks made me think I should make it a little less responsive so I went with 14/14/21 instead of last weeks 3/3/14. As we can see the trend from that k/d crossover is looking very nice as it climbs up from oversold.

# Part II: The Market

Just gonna do a quick breakdown on this as the overall market sentiment remains bullish. However if the SHFs plan was to try to drag this out into a market crash it looks like all the powers that be are actively insuring that doesn't happen. Jerome Powell maybe the most OG bull.

Regardless, the market is still choppy overvalued and unstable so lets look at our indicators moving forward. We saw a decent bounce off Correction Zone #1 this last Tuesday as the market turned around. We could see it continue to surge into next week and a test of that long term-trend. If it fails I will continue to monitor the corrective zones for downward movement.

The Shiller PE is back up .31% this week still looking like the bubble isn't headed anywhere good.

![P\/E 10 back up .31&#37; this week](https://preview.redd.it/lkxmbogekgd71.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebbbce4d5cf8566daa735f873fed63c17d265eb3)

# Part III: Conclusion

There were some things I really wanted to cover however time management is really not my best skill, and I did not expect to be doing this 7 days a week when I started. I may do another DD to fill in some gaps around Wednesday. Technical trend continues to look bullish moving into this week, but, if no volume comes into to support it we may be looking at more flat action slightly up towards the end of the week. There is potential that we could launch into a run on Tuesday as MMs continue to cover their gamma exposure from last week. Thank you all for reading along and for all the support.
