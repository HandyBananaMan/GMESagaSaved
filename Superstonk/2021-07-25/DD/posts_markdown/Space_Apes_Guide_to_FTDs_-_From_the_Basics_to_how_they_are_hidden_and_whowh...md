Hi all, I am SajiMeister. I wrote 25 pages of the Long Con and a few other DDs. My old DDs have some good substance but were at the beginning of my research. Please check them out if you are interested, they are linked to my profile.

🦍The attached PDF is a VERY ROUGH draft of a DD I am working on regarding FTD cycles but have not had a chance to finish it. I am posting this only so apes can have access to this information going into the next few weeks. I will post a finalized peer reviewed version as soon as I have enough time to complete. I estimate a 200 page DD when finished.

Link to unfinished DD on FTDS below. Warning it is very dense and unfinished.

Edit: took down google link due to popular demand.

Wanted to include a convo I had in a Direct Message with another redditor on this post as well. I will also write a more detailed DD on this when I have a chance but want to get this info out.

**QUICK THEORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JANUARY**

I was going to get into this in more details, but I wanted to paste a quick DM message I discussed with someone on reddit regarding what happened in January and what most DD writers are missing.

If whales time the super wedge precisely you can get massive price movements since the support and resistance meets up and they need to recalculate algorithms. Recall a few million shares at the apex and you will destroy shorters.

That’s why shorters moved away from borrowing and moved to FTD's and shuffling. Some institutions in January sold off and they ***HAD*** to recall their shares to sell off. It put the shorters in a pickle, they were forced to deliver shares whether naked or market bought

Shorter’s didn't like the predicament  they were in so they used options, ex-clearing, settlement cycle delays and other methods to move short positions to a place where they can’t get forced share recalls.

No one talked about what I just said in other DDs but institutions ***HAD*** to recall shares to sell off in January. Fidelity sold around January 20th with over 10 million shares. You damn well know they had loaned shares. They recalled the shares then sold. Other institutions that evaluated GME as say a 40$ max company started selling off when the price was 50$ plus. They also recalled their shares on loan to sell. Mix that in with retail mega buying pressure and you have an infinite squeeze. Shorts naked shorted institutions who wanted shares to leave positions. They probably also shorted retail or used odd lots and internal clearing to deal with these "pests". Then institutions used the naked shorts to leave. That’s where the massive volume came from. Shuffling. The shorters either used settlement cycles c+35, options, ex-clearing, and other methods to keep short positions open to wait for the price to drop to not go bankrupt. Price didn’t drop so come February the shorters locked into c+35 covered them on the way up since they were locked out from marking shares as short per Reg SHO then shorted it down when they clear their outstanding Ftds. This left the positions open but probably hurt them since they had to buy up FTDs before they were able to short again to not go bankrupt. Say they covered at an average price of 80$ then shorted on the way down with an average gain of 70$ per share. They still lost at 70$ per share but were able to stay alive. Remember shorts do not need to report Ftds if they use ex-clearing. They still have to oblige to maximum settlement time aka c+35 so they can defend any penalties sec tries to throw at them. Hence why they hire SEC execs to work in their legal department. I believe the deep otm put options never get shuffled tho and we are only seeing volume from the shares shorters chose to  move to C+35 cycles. A tip of the iceberg of naked shorts floating around.

Any arguments wrinkled brains? I have never had anyone discuss my theory. The chart I keep sharing shows obvious correlation with c+35 and short interest drops.

![C+35 and threshold T+13 Correlation Graph. Pretty convincing but I'll let you decide.](https://preview.redd.it/h4s2fulfjfd71.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=e935290fcfc98a6b40a3732f1d930950cff9985f)

Would love for someone to make a counter argument.

I put out a dd on this a couple months ago but didn’t get that much attention because ppl said institutions never sold off in January. And the reason why they hated the theory is that if institutions recalled shares then shorts closed their positions but it is not true. You have to think past that and look at the data

Institutions sold off a lot in January through March. Retail bought up shares and shorters naked shorted to not realize any losses hoping the price would fade down since retail is retards.

This chart says a million words. The short interest lines are by the millions of shares and are Ortex estimated short interest drops on said days . The correlation is staggering regaring when short interest drops and the c+35 settlement cycles from that. My guess is that a percentage of the short interest drops is due to institutions big or small wanting to sell off some of their positions. Recalling their shares triggers shorters to naked short in the name of liquidity and use c+35 cycles to reshuffle

It’s old and before I was very informed with settlement cycles but I outlined the theory and still believe the theory is 99% correct.

I even got a snake award for it but I am 99% certain my theory is correct and people dance around it because they believe that shorters report short interst and not institutions. DOMO capital even backed up this statement in the AMA they did.

Now that shorters took control of shorts using naked shorting they don’t report them anymore.

Ftds are settled ex-clearing which is a giant loophole to not report Ftds. The sec acknowledged this and said they wouldn’t change it unless “it gets out of hand”.

The giant drops are from institutions receiving their naked shorts then selling off. Less institutions now, hence why the volatility is less on run ups.

Basically they said only 10% of trades are settled through ex-clearing “external clearing” . So they didn’t think those numbers would impact the market. The thing is that with gme they are using ex-clearing way more than any other stock because they are in a corner and will use any loop hole to stay alive.

# Bonus Graph

The below graph compares reported Ortex estimated short interest (grey line) to estimated short interest based on analyzing data from Ortex regarding borrowed shares (orange line) and returned shares every day. Basically the orange line starts at the end of July with official short interest numbers from July then the remaining line is only drawn using the daily borrowed and returned share data from Ortex. As you can see the estimate falls in line with Oretex's estimated short interest for the most part until the January extreme drop off in short interest. For some reason Ortex's short interest estimate doesn't even fall in line with their reported borrowed and returned shares every day. Using Ortex data instituional short interest is at least at 60 million shares. This does not include option FTDs, settlement C+35 FTDs or in house FTDs. Some more research needs to be done on this but it is eye opening.

If you want to see how the short interest estimate was made using ortex dat see the figure below.

***TLDR:*** The attached PDF is unfinished but has 80 pages worth of useful information regarding FTDs. Shorters use ex-clearing to keep FTDs open without reporting. Short interest drops also follow C+35 cycles. The short interest was moved from borrowed shares to naked shorts since January. These numbers do not have to be reported if done through ex-clearing. Prior to January sneeze institutions loaning out shares were the ones reporting the numbers. The number of institutions loaning shares dropped hence why the reported short interest dropped. The shorts are still being hidden through FTDs which have a complex rule book but obvious loop holes. The institutions left diamond handed through the January squeeze and will not sell at the low runup prices being seen. The flash crashes seen in January and March were due to shorters giving institutions naked shorts. The institutions wanted to sell but had to recall their shares to sell so the shorters gave them naked shorts or shares created out of thin air. The institutions then sold off the naked shorts to leave their position hence creating the flash crashes. Retail bought up these shares thanks to the help of wall street bets and Elon Musk. Check out the PDF linked at the top to discover ways to hide FTDS.

As always buy and hodl. Read through the PDF to get more wrinkles if you are into that. And rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
