Let's make a list. I will add to this list as I go. 📃


The Federal Reserve kicks off its latest two-day meeting on Tuesday

Monetary policy decision and press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell set to take place Wednesday afternoon. 

Debt Ceiling vote this week(?)

The Sikh GG starts, and will be a prosecutor

⚠️Market volitility almost guaranteed with this week's company earnings reports: Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, AMD, Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, PayPal etc..

Higher max pain at 190, suggesting upward movement to the 190 and a nice options ramp ahead of it. Gonna run to the ramp Evil Knievel style! (?)

(Buy shares, options remain an unnecessary risk. Buying in IEX is best)

Max pain is above 190 for 8/6/21 and 8/13/21 as well!!!

T-21 day today and a T-35 on 7/28!
