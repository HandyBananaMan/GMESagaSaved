# PART 1: FIRST CONTACT

Two days ago, I was looking through the DD section and found something interesting: a since-deleted post titled “The invisible shorts and the unfriendly whale” ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the\_invisible\_shorts\_and\_the\_unfriendly\_whale](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the_invisible_shorts_and_the_unfriendly_whale); EDIT: can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20210415022513if\_/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the\_invisible\_shorts\_and\_the\_unfriendly\_whale/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210415022513if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the_invisible_shorts_and_the_unfriendly_whale/)). This was essentially a bear thesis, and while I’m unable to recount the entire DD by memory, its primary arguments were:

* The short interest has drastically decreased and is no longer high enough to sustain or imply a short squeeze
* The movement in the stock price since the January spikes can largely be explained by institutional whales taking advantage of the high volatility to make options plays and is not indicative of an incoming short squeeze

Now, before you all dismiss the DD author (or me) as a shill, hear me out. Although I’m bullish on GME, I’m of the opinion that both sides of an argument can be equally valuable and insightful if they are well-researched and well-argued. This DD—in my opinion—was. Hearing the opposing side’s case can help you formulate a clearer view of the situation while taking factors you might not have previously considered (due to bias) into account.

While I unfortunately don't have a copy of this counter-DD (and don't know how to access/view deleted posts, maybe someone can help me out; EDIT: here it is [https://web.archive.org/web/20210415022513if\_/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the\_invisible\_shorts\_and\_the\_unfriendly\_whale/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210415022513if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the_invisible_shorts_and_the_unfriendly_whale/)), I do have a copy of my initial response to said DD (which does restate what I believe to be the primary components of his thesis, so you can understand what I’m responding to), along with a copy of *his* response to my response (something that I will, in turn, be rebutting in all of Parts 3, 5, and 6—although Part 6 is more of an ordered synopsis—of this post). My initial response is as follows ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the\_invisible\_shorts\_and\_the\_unfriendly\_whale/gukwueq?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mr5mot/the_invisible_shorts_and_the_unfriendly_whale/gukwueq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)):

**1.1: Poking the Bear**

“Hey there. As opposed to the barrage of mindless downvoting and baseless accusations that are getting hurled at you, I’d like to try and start some sort of civil discourse. I simply ask that you hear me out and read all that I have to say before responding. Your DD does bring up some good points, with, in my opinion, the most pertinent ones being the low borrow fee and the drastic decrease in FTDs. If you don’t mind, these are the factors I’ll be focusing on because, as I said, I believe that these are the most relevant components of your thesis. According to Investopedia, “the degree of short interest, therefore, provides an indication of the stock loan fee amount. Stocks with a high degree of short interest are more difficult to borrow than a stock with low short interest, as there are fewer shares to borrow.” Therefore, it stands to reason that a high short interest yields a high borrow fee, and that a low borrow fee implies low short interest, as you say. The borrow fee is actually something I’ve been keeping an eye on for the past few weeks or so, and, indeed, the consistently low rates you mentioned have perplexed me as well.

Now, the FTDs. You claimed that the FTDs and the borrow fee were strongly correlated, so I checked the graphs (from [https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/) and [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), respectively), and once again, you’re completely correct. FTD spikes in late April to early May and early to mid October of last year pretty much line up perfectly with jumps in the borrow fee around the same times. Additionally, I dug up the FTD data ([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)), and, like you said, they have drastically decreased since the start of the year, going from \~15 million in January, to 974k in February, to 386k in the first half of March. If short interest is indicated by the borrow fee, and the borrow fee is more or less perfectly correlated with the number of FTDs, one may justifiably infer that a drastic decrease in the borrow fee and the number of FTDs indicates a drastic decrease in the short interest as well. This is a perfectly reasonable conclusion to arrive at (as you have), and after checking the data for myself, I began to agree with said conclusion. I would describe myself as a pretty rational guy, and the data, at first glance, seems very damning. However, after doing some more research, I have come to believe there is something you failed to account for.

Now, if my memory serves me correctly, I began to hear about large purchases of deep ITM calls as early as February. My reaction was somewhat naive: I simply assumed that this was yet another bullish signal, that big money was betting on the price to go up. Sometime after that, though, I began seeing DD about how deep ITM calls could actually be used to obscure short interest. Now, I will admit, this sounded like some wild and needlessly abstruse speculation to me at first. However, I later came upon this article regarding the filing (and potential passage) of SR-DTC-2021-005: [https://tokenist.com/is-wsb-reddit-army-about-to-make-a-comeback-with-tweaked-trading-rules/](https://tokenist.com/is-wsb-reddit-army-about-to-make-a-comeback-with-tweaked-trading-rules/). Note that this is from a credible publication ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tokenist-receives-perfect-newsguard-rating-180400009.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tokenist-receives-perfect-newsguard-rating-180400009.html)) and written by a similarly credible author (“He started his career with GE in engineering and operations management where he held various leadership roles before leaving to pursue an MBA (he is a proud former co-chair of the Milton Friedman Group at Chicago Booth). After business school, Tim spent several years with Baird Capital where he made private equity investments in consumer and industrial companies. He left Baird to found Protective Technologies Capital in 2018, where he continues to make private equity investments in family businesses looking for help with succession planning.” for Tim Fries at [https://tokenist.com/about/](https://tokenist.com/about/)); the article states that the new regulation implies the following:

* Hedge funds would no longer be able to hide their positions by abusing call option ITM trading. Unlike futures, call options refer to financial contracts that give the buyer the right to buy assets without having the obligation. In turn, ITM – In The Money – call option happens when the underlying security’s price is above the call option’s strike price.
* Of course, with such a price differential, this gives ITM call options value, which can then be sold. When hedge funds then sell ITM call options, they mask their short positions, which appear as having been closed.
* Likewise, this would countervail synthetic put options strategy. This stock market stratagem revolves around combining long call options with short stock positions.  This is done for the purpose of mimicking the long put option, or synthetic long put. In short, when synthetic shares are traded in conjunction with options, they provide an appearance of a closed short position.

Okay, so what? Admittedly, this didn’t mean much to me when I first read it. I basically just thought, “Oh, so the theories about deep ITM calls being used to obscure short positions weren’t just baseless and schizophrenic speculation akin to apes asking if Elon would be the next CEO? Cool!”, and moved on with my day. However, your DD dislodged this quaint little memory for me, so I looked up the article and found it to be incredibly relevant, seeing as how it pertains to the potential obscuring of the short position (something you vehemently declare to be improbable and overly conspiratorial). However—even if they are from a seemingly reliable source—a few snappy bullet points aren’t enough for me (and I’m guessing they aren’t for you either, my fastidious friend). Luckily, combing through your DD for inconsistencies did yield another memory: two incredibly well-researched and plausible pieces of DD regarding the subject at hand. I won’t attempt to summarize them (as I wouldn’t do them justice), but please do give them a read:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the\_si\_is\_fake\_i\_found\_44000000\_million\_shorts/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the_si_is_fake_i_found_44000000_million_shorts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi31m6/deep\_itm\_calls\_activity\_pt2\_april\_1st\_708000\_ftds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi31m6/deep_itm_calls_activity_pt2_april_1st_708000_ftds/)

In my opinion, these are painstakingly thorough (the first more than the second, seeing as how the latter is more a companion piece largely comprised of pure data in comparison to the pairing of data and reasoning/argumentation in the former), backed by hard data, and realistically palpable. Additionally, I’m tagging the DD author ([u/dejf2](https://www.reddit.com/u/dejf2/)) as I’d like to see his thoughts on your DD. This is a collaborative forum, after all.

Finally, I’d like to provide a few relevant passages from this SEC paper (also referenced in the previously linked DD; I’m a bit of a citation grubber, can you tell?) on—you guessed it—resetting FTDs through the utilization of various options-related strategies, titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations” ([https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)):

“The trading strategies discussed in this Risk Alert could be used to give the impression that purchases by the short seller have satisfied the close-out requirement of the clearing firm or the broker-dealer to whom a fail to deliver position was allocated. We have observed, however, that in reality the purchased shares in question are often times not delivered because of subsequent options trading used to re-establish or otherwise extend the broker-dealer’s fail position without any demonstrable legitimate economic purpose, such that the clearing firm or broker-dealer allocated a fail to deliver position does not satisfy the close-out requirement.”

“Although an options market maker engaged in bona fide market making activity may claim an exception to the locate requirement, to comply with Reg SHO, the options market maker must still deliver shares in settlement of the short sale, or if a fail to deliver position results at the clearing firm, the fail to deliver must be closed-out in accordance with Rule 204 of Reg SHO. It may be a violation of Regulation SHO, however, where the options market maker does not deliver shares, and instead engages in a second, subsequent transaction in order to give the appearance of satisfying the clearing firm’s obligation to purchase or borrow the security to close out the resulting settlement fail pursuant to Rule 204 close-out requirements (“reset transaction”).”

“Assuming that XYZ is a hard to borrow security, and that Trader A, or its broker-dealer, is unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. The buy-writes may be (but are not always) prearranged trades between market makers or parties claiming to be market makers. The price in these transactions is determined so that the short seller pays a small price to the other market-maker for the trade, resulting in no economic benefit to the short seller for the reset transaction other than to give the appearance of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.”

I thought the last one was especially relevant, given how you stated that, “married puts and calls are common misunderstandings it's an arbitrage options strategy that uses the word synthetic so people think it has to do with synthetic shares. Its merely a strategy that involves a synthetic position meaning the usage of another financial instrument to in play” yet this paper confirms how married puts can be used to reset FTDs while simultaneously describing how “hard to borrow securities can be subject to a pricing disparity relative to options trading on the same security. Typically, this may be seen in “synthetic” positions (combinations of call and put options that generally would be expected to mirror the value of the underlying security) trading at a lower price than the underlying security” and stating that “This creates a potential profit opportunity for short sellers of the underlying equity security in combination with call and put options if these short sellers can avoid the high cost typically associated with obtaining for delivery the hard to borrow security that was sold short”, exactly like you said. You should read the paper as well; it’s pretty insightful.

So, in summation, short positions can be masked through the resetting of FTDs, something that—in my opinion—is likely the case with GME. As aforementioned, I found the two primary points of note in your DD to be the low borrow fees and the decrease in FTDs, both of which imply a low short interest. However, if FTDs are falsely delineated as delivered (i.e. short positions are hidden and mistakenly assumed to be closed), short interest is obscured and erroneously marked as low, which, in turn, can result in unknowing financial institutions formulating substantially decreased borrow fees based on low short interest that isn’t really so low after all.

You strongly assert that the possibility of short interest being obscured is ridiculous and would require mass market collusion, which you justifiably dismiss as implausible. I disagree: there is a very tangible possibility that resetting FTDs/short position obscuring has led to a laughably low borrow fee and an apparent sharp decrease in said FTDs, thus implying that the short interest is alive and well. This is not conspiratorial speculation; this is not grasping at straws. I believe I’ve presented a veritable monolith of certifiable evidence which strongly suggests that this is—if not the case—at least a strong possibility. This is a known practice, and it is worth noting that this somewhat narrow kind of options arbitrage is limited to a similarly narrow range of actors, as described in the SEC paper: “Such opportunities are extremely rare in options trading, are generally corrected very quickly and may not result in net profit after fees and commissions. Such rare, short lived opportunities are typically only accessible by, and profitable to, professional options traders such as floor traders and market makers who may pay lower fees and commissions.” Hm, I wonder which nefarious, front-running HFT firm-cum-market maker this reminds me of?

Ultimately, we’re all speculating. However, I do believe I’ve provided enough evidence to bring the primary (in my opinion) components of your thesis into question. Get back to me after you’ve parsed all the sources. Thanks!"

**1.2: The Bear Pokes Back**

"ok im back. So I took a long good at the dd and its very evident of deep itm shorts hiding. Its not even a debate that their hiding however the OP seems to think there are 44million shorts but his post shows the contrary

![https://preview.redd.it/rgc2ebma9kq61.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec68c1d5dedb0dfef4e6c3129c9f3b0a662ac5f](https://preview.redd.it/rgc2ebma9kq61.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec68c1d5dedb0dfef4e6c3129c9f3b0a662ac5f)

Lets take the entire deep itm calls as an FTD reset for easier argument.

So we can see about 36 million FTDs have been reset. That is 72% of the float

So at this point we can know from the original short percent of 141% that 69% covered.

Then next t+14 days we see only 7415200 resetted. This is a substantional drop to 14%percent short interest that is hidden. On april it drops even further. We see this tallies up with the decreasing SI. So the hidden SI from janurary had enough volume on the dip rebound downwards to cover this hidden SI.

Then on April it gets worse at only 1,033,500 resetted. So its safe to say that this number is more or less covered hence why you see a lack of deep itm activity.

We can deduce that from the OPs post that they did indeed cover.

As for the married puts argument. Theres very little basis here. So its basically a way to prolong covering shorts to your broker dealer.

"Moreover, if the clearing firm or broker-dealer that was allocated the fail to deliver position enters into an arrangement with another person to purchase securities as required by Rule 204, and the clearing firm, or broker-dealer that was allocated a fail to deliver position, knows or has reason to know that the other person will not deliver securities in settlement of the purchase, then the transaction is a sham close-out, in violation of Rule 204(f). "

However in the Sec documents it says if the broker dealer knows or has a reason to know for failed delivery then he can close out the position himself. However in the case for gme there isnt any evidence of that. Theres some reddit post talking about high OI for puts but the OI has dropped to 2.5k now. Its not common for a stocks total OI to be higher than the float. Look at amc shares relative to their total open interest.

Also in addition to that must married puts use option flex contracts for it. For this strategy to work both put and calls must match each other identical in terms of expiration etc. So there is no indication I've seen anywhere that a mass number of married puts are being used.

As mentioned by sec aswell if the broker - dealer has reason to believe you are doing this then they will force close the position. Which in this case if theres 70 to 250 million shares it would be glaringly obvious they do.

However all evidence suffice to still showing the covered.

Let me know what you think if I missed something"

I saw his response when I woke up and replied with this:

"Hi, thanks for the reply! After briefly parsing your response, I do think you draw some incorrect conclusions and misinterpret the data, but I'm going to have breakfast before digging in deeper and writing up why I think so. Again, I appreciate you opening a dialogue with me on this; I think a lot of people on here need to understand that civil disagreement (and subsequent discourse) can be incredibly insightful and conducive to fact-finding along with helping prevent echo chambers."

...receiving a cheerful "No worries!" in response soon after. By the time I returned, after a pleasant (yet largely unremarkable) bowl of Mini Wheats, both the post and his account, u/solarpanel200, were deleted.

# PART 2: MORE BACKSTORY AND GENERAL PREPARATORY RUBBING TOGETHER OF HANDS BEFORE VENTURING INTO THE DEEP

Now, before I dive into my second rebuttal, I want to clarify something. This particular poster was basically *solely* active on the multitude of subreddits which cover (and are—with the exception of r/gme_meltdown—primarily bullish on) GME. Looking through his comment history, it was clear that he is a *hardcore* disbeliever of the squeeze, demonstrated by his voracious assertions of this (usually backed by relatively logical argumentation and solid data points) along with consistent responses to people questioning him or calling him a shill or a FUDster. A lot of people have pointed out the fact that he has deleted earlier, contradictory posts (one saying something along the lines of "SELL NOW" and another proclaiming "HOLD YOU FUCKING APES, DON'T GET SCARED"—these are not verbatim replications, but you get the gist); to this, he replied by saying that his opinions had changed and that he had deleted older posts precisely so he wouldn't receive the sort of accusations he ended up getting hit with anyways. In my opinion, there are two points of note here:

1. I don't believe this guy was a shill. I genuinely think he was simply an overly earnest and  obsessive type, something I can relate to. A lot of his arguments were evidence-backed and definitely didn't fall into the baseless "hurr durr GME going to 40 tomorrow sell now" kind of claims. I sort of see him as someone justifiably frustrated with this (like it or not) proto-echo chamber that is increasingly unreceptive to alternative viewpoints or differing opinions, someone who genuinely tried to develop a credible bear thesis/counter DD with no intent of shilling. Some might argue that he's a more sophisticated shill, but I don't buy it. And even if this was the case...
2. ...it doesn't matter if he's a shill. What matters is his argument, and, as aforementioned, it's a credible, valid one that deserves to be considered and responded to. I honestly couldn't care less about the intent behind his DD; I only care about its substance. As I said before, taking perspectives which don't necessarily align with yours into account is important; wholly ignoring and dismissing them is likely to lead to the sort of feedback loop of confirmation bias which this subreddit seems to be settling into (and, dare I say, has been for a while now). Having a Devil's Advocate is important, and u/solarpanel200 made a good case (i.e. his counter DD post, which I am yet again asking someone with more Reddit know-how than me to uncover and post in the comments, thank you).

One final point before I move on to my rebuttal of his response: I know his posts have a history of being deleted on pertinent subreddits, but I'm unsure as to whether the mods of a specific subreddit have the power to facilitate the actual deletion of his account, as some of the more conspiratorially-minded users on r/gme_meltdown—where u/solarpanel200 was a known figure—have suggested. I don't know how plausible this is, I don't know if only the user can delete their own account, and I don't why he did delete his (if that is the case). Maybe he was a shill, maybe he was getting a lot of unfounded hate (see the picture below), maybe he gave up on what he saw as a lost cause, I'm not sure. Either way, I thought I'd mention it. Mods, please feel free to clarify.

![Not only is this rude, it's the weak-minded equivalent of plugging your ears and going \\"la la la\\" when someone makes an argument in favor of something you don't want to hear. Learn how to take opposing perspectives into serious consideration—as this can genuinely help develop more nuanced and well-informed opinions—instead of lashing out at anyone who doesn't blindly agree with you and\/or feed your confirmation bias.](https://preview.redd.it/dl1j2z58not61.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e01d202b86524a921ec27079a255cf02d41f87)

# PART 3: ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH

The following second rebuttal is addressed directly to the man u/solarpanel200 himself. If you have some sort of alt or new account, feel free to respond here, or in the original, deleted thread/post of yours, where I'll be attaching a link to this post as well:

(Note: the phrases “FTD reset period”, “reset period”, “reset cycle”, and any other potential permutations/combinations of the words “FTD/s”, “reset”, “period”, and “cycle” are all synonymous. They refer to the exact same thing: a range of time in which an abnormally high amount of FTDs are reset, obscuring short positions and artifically decreasing reported short interest as a result.)

**3.1: The First FTD Reset Cycle, January 1-February 4**

Firstly, I want to acknowledge you conceding the high likelihood of short positions being masked with deep ITM calls. As you say, “So I took a long good \[look\] at the dd and its very evident of deep itm shorts hiding. Its not even a debate that their hiding.” I’m glad we agree on this! The DD truly is one of the best I've read (I will be elaborating more on just why it is so credible in Part 4.2). However, I feel as though you make several mistakes in the assertions which follow: “So we can see about 36 million FTDs have been reset. That is 72% of the float. So at this point we can know from the original short percent of 141% that 69% covered.”

I don’t quite understand what you’re saying here. You say that 36 million FTDs were reset (72% of the float), but then say that we can infer 69% of the original 141% short position was covered (with your logic assumedly being 141-72=69). No offense, but this doesn’t make much sense to me. I refer you once again to these passages from the aforementioned SEC paper ([https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)):

“We have observed, however, that in reality the purchased shares in question are often times not delivered because of subsequent options trading used to re-establish or otherwise extend the broker-dealer’s fail position without any demonstrable legitimate economic purpose…”

“It may be a violation of Regulation SHO, however, where the options market maker does not deliver shares, and instead engages in a second, subsequent transaction in order to give the appearance of satisfying the clearing firm’s obligation to purchase or borrow the security to close out the resulting settlement fail pursuant to Rule 204 close-out requirements (“reset transaction”).”

“These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations…resulting in no economic benefit to the short seller for the reset transaction other than to give the appearance of meeting his delivery obligations…Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.”

These all essentially confirm the fact that resetting FTDs makes it *seem* like borrowed shares have been delivered/short positions have been closed, even though this is **not** the case. In other words, resetting FTDs artificially lowers (reported) short interest while being used to “re-establish or otherwise extend the broker-dealer’s fail position without any demonstrable legitimate economic purpose” and “could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations”.

Let’s look at these graphs from the first pertinent DD (once again, at [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the\_si\_is\_fake\_i\_found\_44000000\_million\_shorts/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the_si_is_fake_i_found_44000000_million_shorts/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)):

&#x200B;

![I'll imaginatively refer to this as \\"the first graph\\" for the rest of this post](https://preview.redd.it/60dz3hivnot61.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=9720a06237d2dce08d4cf74c3fcf34d1e74572df)

![Hmm, I wonder what I'll call this one](https://preview.redd.it/5md8z7t0oot61.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=baeac3e2617ed16e52c93d04bd43ec3c266b5ea1)

So, at the end of the period of time (February 4) when 36.6 million FTDs (let's round down to 36) had been reset (i.e. 72% of the shorts were obscured, **not** **closed**), the number of shorts as reported by S3 was a bit less than 20 million (eyeballing the second graph, I’d say 18m, but let’s use 15m as an overly conservative estimate), or 30% of the float (using 15m). Remember, the 72% isn’t accounted for, so the true number of shorts at this point is 51 million (the reported 15 added to the obscured 36), or 102% of the float.

The only way that 69% of the shorts were covered would be if the number of reported shorts was 0 at the end of that time period; taking away the 36 million FTDs (72%), you’re left with 34.5 million shorts (69%), which you’re positing were fully covered. Unless 15 million somehow equals 0, the number of shorts that were actually covered (or closed) at the end of the first FTD reset period (with 36 million FTDs) is 19.5 million, or

141% of the float (70.5 million shorts) - 102% of the float (72% of the float, or the 36 million obscured shorts, added to 30% of the float, or the conservative estimate of the reported 15 million shorts)

which gives us an overestimate of 39% of the float being covered—and yields a reported short interest of 30% and a cumulative, **actual** short interest ("hidden" SI—as you put it—plus reported SI) of 102% (remember, still a somewhat conservative estimate)—at the end of the 36 million FTD reset period (again, roughly February 4th).

It is worth noting that although the graph shows two separate blocks of FTD resets (6.6m for the first, 30m for the second), there is no two week gap between these blocks (as there is between these blocks and the next block, and between the next block and the beginning of the third block) which has led me to characterize the entire January 1 to February 4 period as one FTD reset cycle, the first of three. You sort of do this as well when you use the full 36 million figure (as you should) instead of using 6.6m and 30m separately.

Edit 2: If you don't want to read the whole thing, I'd say you should at least read sections 4.1 and 5.2
