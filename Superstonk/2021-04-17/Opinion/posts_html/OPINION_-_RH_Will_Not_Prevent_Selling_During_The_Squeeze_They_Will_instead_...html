<p>Edit 3: Apparently partial transfers take significantly less time than full transfers (thanks u/ZenoZh) </p>
<p>If they prevent selling during the squeeze, that helps 💎👐 push the price up. But if they close your position for you at the start (say "for your own protection..."), that helps the shorts cover faster.</p>
<p>Point is, GET OFF RH ASAP</p>

<p>Edit: this is not meant to be fud - just my personal opinion of the type of shady shit RH would pull (closing positions without permission as opposed to restricting selling). I wish the best for all GME holders</p>
