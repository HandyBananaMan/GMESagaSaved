They must be dying to talk about all the things that went on (but couldn't because of all the potential controversy and lawsuits that can be had) and apes would love to get the official explanation on the cryptic, and some not so cryptic tweets from DFV and RC.

Edit: it may be obvious but it's just an opinion of mine on to see what they may have to say. If it does somehow gain enough traction, we would respectfully ask them if they're interested. If not, no AMA. Simple as that.
