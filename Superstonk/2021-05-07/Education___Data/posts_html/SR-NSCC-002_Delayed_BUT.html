<p>Yes this rule did get delayed until June 21st (https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm#SR-NSCC-2021-002) BUT this does not mean that the MOASS will not happen until then.</p>
<p>Volume is so low right now that any even slightly bullish announcement from GameStop could ignite this thing. Possible announcements/catalysts from GameStop; CEO announcement, more votes than float, merger, acquisition, crypto dividend just to name a few. </p>
<p>My opinion is that Cohen was waiting to see if they would approve these rules before the shareholder meeting but since 002 was pushed back until June 21st he may take matters into his own hands. Remember, GameStop specifically stated in their SEC filings that a short squeeze is very likely to happen due to excessive short selling and if this does happen GameStop is not at fault. Cohen is the man with a plan.</p>
<p>Do not let this delay worry you at all. It would help the moass start but is not necessary.</p>
<p>Edit: Many comments are saying it is delayed until June 21st at the latest but can be accepted before then.</p>
