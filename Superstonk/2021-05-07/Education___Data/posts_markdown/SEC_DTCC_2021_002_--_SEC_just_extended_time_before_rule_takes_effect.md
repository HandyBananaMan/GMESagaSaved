Just now a filing on the SEC web site for SEC DTCC 2021 002 (which we're watching closely because it's also connected with 008) went up. It's a notice that the intial 45 day time period for consideration has been extended to the maximum 90 day period.

This one thing remains: I can hold longer than hedgies can stay solvent.

I can out-wait any government agency.

I can out-wait any HF.

Tick, tock.
