I found it to be incredibly tit-jacking. For the first time, we got to see our boy Gary \"The GameStopper\" Gensler (as I like to call him) in action...\n\nAfter all of the rumors that Gary Gensler was gonna' be our guy, I was pleased with with the sentiment he seemed to convey. I really got the feeling that we share similar interests in this.\n\n**These were my top three GG moments:**\n\n1.[This next one completely destroys all arguments that this subreddit or the language we use (such as We or Us) is \"Market Manipulation\" So that FUD is now dead (1:14)](https://youtu.be/vX2X8xxHEns?t=4448)\n\n2.[Gary Gensler says that The Sec has a responsibility to protect us from shills. Also, here he insinuates that that all we are doing here is exercising our free speech (1:18)](https://youtu.be/vX2X8xxHEns?t=4717)\n\n3. [Gensler touching on Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) and how it can end up being opposed to the retail investors best interests](https://youtu.be/vX2X8xxHEns?t=4382) (1:13)\n\n**Honorable mention:** [**The submitted written testimony is definitely worth a read**](https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-20210505?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery)**!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GG's got our back](https://preview.redd.it/3kxcl49rmmx61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0fe683c1cb073848ab104a97bf62a52293a3760)\n\nI am extremely excited to hear more about this \"meme stocks report\" that the SEC is going to put out \"in the summer\", that is where the really juicy stuff is going to come from the SEC...\n\nTill then we continue to HODL, waiting for the slow-moving bureaucracy to catch-up. I will highlight something Dave Lauer said in his AMA to remind us that the SEC is going to help and is our friend here:\n\n*\"They don't move quickly, if there's anything that I can tell you--  It doesn't mean that they're being incompetent, or deliberately dragging their feet. They're a government regulator and they move extremely slowly .\" -* u/dlauer\n\nThese things take time. I am impatient though, so I am going to keep buying more while we have to wait.\n\nNOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\ud83d\udea8\n\n# Back to you, u/PinkCatsonAcid! \ud83e\udd84\ud83d\udc08\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\n\n[We love u\\/Dlauer ](https://preview.redd.it/lh1c691p5mx61.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=be53011914dc49535fd3d2196bdb902c4f0e2aa7)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Worth repeating: Control numbers, voting, and Carl Hagberg!!!\n\n*This is a copy paste of the \"Rock the Vote\" post.*\n\n**The focus of the sub from now until June 9 is going to be** ***VOTING***\n\nWe don't make claims about catalysts around here. So I'm definitely NOT telling you that this could be the catalyst.\n\nBut the importance of exercising your right to vote cannot be understated. **THIS IS OUR ONE SHOT TO PROVE TO THE SEC AND EVERYONE ELSE WHAT IS HAPPENING. GAMESTOP NEEDS OUR HELP!!**\n\nFidelity users, TDA, WeBull, Vanguard, Schwab, and more all reported being able to get their hands on their control number and vote as of yesterday. Feel free to drop a comment below if you have already voted and want to show that off!! **WE ARE GIVING AWAY VOTED STICKERS (FLAIRS) TO EVERYONE THAT HAS VOTED!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nBe sure to check your inbox and contact your broker if you have any questions. And also be sure that if you have multiple brokerages accounts, you will need to get a different control number for each one. So if you carry shares in 3 different brokerage accounts (I do, cuz I don't trust a bitch) then you will have 3 different control numbers and will be voting 3 different times.\n\n**Steps to Voting:**\n\n1. HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER\n\nObtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.\n\n2. INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).\n\nDo not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.\n\n3. UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.\n\nTake a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.\n\n4. SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.\n\n5. SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.\n\n**Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\ud83d\udc08 **BUT PINK, WHAT IF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY CONTROL NUMBER YET?! \ud83e\udda7**\n\n**Well, did you...**\n\n* Check your broker inbox for proxy info\u2714\n* Check your email\u2714\n* Send a message via your broker help/chat interface\u2714\n* Call your broker and request your control number\u2714\n* Look around the comments and other posts to see if any resources have been shared that might help you in your search\u2714\n* Check your broker's website for an FAQ- Many have a landing page with GME specific proxy info\u2714\n\nKeep in mind some brokers just haven't issued them yet. And some are anticipating up to a week or longer wait before you can vote. Geez, it seems almost like they're having trouble finding the shares to vote or something. \ud83e\udd14\n\n**I can confirm that Robinhood and TDA are issuing control numbers that come up invalid when you enter them in the official Gamestop proxy website. I don't know what that means. I am still investigating why brokers seems to have their own landing page for proxy voting.

There wouldn't be so much attack 24/7 if we weren't on the verge of something incredible.** So I urge you to always ignore (but report) the FUD and the attacks.
