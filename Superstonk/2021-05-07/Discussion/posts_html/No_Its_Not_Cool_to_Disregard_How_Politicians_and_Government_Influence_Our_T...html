<p>First of all, It's SO FUCKING EASY to just give up and dismiss the system as "never gonna work for us" and "it's stupid to believe it can, just do you and only have faith in yourself".</p>
<p>That is a very dangerous and unsettling train of thinking. That is exactly the thinking the people in power not working on our behalf and advocating for our interests <em>want</em> us to have, because it <strong>keeps</strong> them in power!</p>
<p>If we citizens cannot and do not hold <em>ourselves</em> accountable for electing and allowing for this behavior, then how ever can the group of individuals who control TRILLIONS of the tendies we've <em>already</em> made, be forced to change?</p>
<p>It is SO low effort to make disengaging with politics and politicians "cool" and "smart". Not only does it perpetuate the current state of affairs, it's in fact, very dangerous to do so.</p>
<p>If we got our tendies and they decided to change tax law, where that we would now have to pay 90% on gains, then what? "Well, we all knew they were cunts so..." And then....<em>nothing</em>?</p>
<p>I am completely dumbfounded by how some people think it's "cool" to dismiss and neglect holding our government accountable, but then bitch about how "none should be trusted".</p>
<p>This is how the fuck they keep getting voted in AND how we keep getting FUCKED over.</p>
<p>I personally am disheartened by some people's apparent nonchalant dismissal of politicians, their role in government, WHO votes them in and WHO is their boss.</p>
<p>WE are their BOSSES!</p>
<p>I'm glad people are upset. I'm glad more people have become disillusioned to the reality. I hope that people do not see these reactions from "newly aware" citizens and encourage them to disengage and just "worry about buying and holding" or "only have faith in yourself". But rather build awareness and power to change who sits in these seats and represents us.</p>
<p>Guess who else doesn't like government, and so much so they <strong>refuse</strong> to pay taxes?</p>
<p>You guessed it, the 1%!</p>
<p>Only thing is people on here give up on taking control of their government, hedgies buy the government....and the people on this sub.</p>
<p>Just think, once people get their "tendies", per the sentiments mentioned above, it'll be cool to just ignore that government exists and let it keep fucking over the general population, cuz, "at least I got mine".</p>
<p>And boy, does that sound familiar...</p>
<p>No. We are change-makers, we aren't waiting for the future, we ARE the future.</p>
<p>The idea we keep re-electing people who  “should never be trusted" while they control TRILLIONS of OUR money and that we should just ignore their existence and accept things as they are, preferring to just say "they are a joke", "they are all the same" and provide no accountability is ENABLING, not helping.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for the idea we are powerless, that we are not creators of change, or that a lot of money is necessary to win; be it your own election run or a campaign for change and accountability.</p>
<p>The message and your believers who will knock on doors and put feet to the fire is what ultimately wins, if you put in the effort.</p>
<p>Stronger Together!</p>
