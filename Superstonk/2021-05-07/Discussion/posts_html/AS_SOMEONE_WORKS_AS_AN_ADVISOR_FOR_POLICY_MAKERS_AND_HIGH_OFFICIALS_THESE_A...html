<p>What makes this sub so powerful is the diversity of its people and their thoughts, educational backgrounds, experiences, the list goes on. We have people from all walks of life that are willing to contribute to society to ensure a fair and equal financial system that works for everyone. In my humble opinion, as long as we see corporate money in federal election campaigns and politics, the US will never see the light of justice and equality. <strong>Where do we go from here?</strong></p>
<p>I think a group of well-educated apes can make a huge difference in the world we live in. I am sure we are all here for different reasons, but we can all agree that besides making money, we are hoping to make positive changes to the financial system and add value to the stock market. Education is critical when dealing with pressing and sophisticated issues that not only the general public can’t comprehend but even experts in the field may find it very difficult to digest. </p>
<p>I proposed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6idf4/i_am_going_to_throw_this_for_mods_to_consider_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"><strong><em>this initiative</em></strong></a>  and it looks like my idea received some attention from you apes. </p>
<p><strong>As someone who works to brief senior management, executive committee members and even policy makers including high official such as ministers (equivalent of Secretaries in US), I can tell you arming politicians with knowledge and preparing them to understand complex issues is extremely important. Love it or hate it, but without politicians, change will not be easy to facilitate.</strong> </p>
<p>As a policy advisor/economist/analyst if this issue was to land on my desk, I would propose the following steps to ensure my Minister is briefed thoroughly:  </p>
<p><strong>Step one:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Pick 3 compelling arguments (DD) from r/superstonk and combined them into one <strong>Master DD</strong>.</li>
<li>Summarize the Master DD and draft 3 page briefing note (AKA “action memo” or “policy memo” - mark it <em>For Information</em> ~~not for action~~)</li>
<li>In the Master DD we need to follow these specific steps: <strong>A.</strong> Small introduction to explain the recurring financial crisis (3-4 lines max) <strong>B.</strong> Define the issue clearly and summarize findings and implications <strong>C.</strong> Illustrate how you arrived to the findings through perhaps qualitative or quantitative analysis</li>
<li>Propose solutions (3 options) and highlight the necessity of thorough investigation or the need to take specific action</li>
<li>Recommend the best approach you see fit to address the issue </li>
<li>At this point, I would run this information by <strong>Dr. Queen Kong Trimbath and Silverback Dave Lauer</strong> for approval.</li>
<li>I would even go ahead and draft a PowerPoint presentation (10 slides max) with more <strong>charts and visual</strong> data versus text</li>
<li>I would reach out to the following members of Congress to read the briefing note</li>
<li>Give them a deadline (yes - a deadline) to come back with comments and questions.</li>
<li>Invite them to attend our educational LIVE presentation on YouTube to address those concerns. </li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Why did I pick those members? Simply because during the hearing they were not afraid of talking about THE important issues, such as naked short selling, Dark pools, payment for order flow and Citadel's incredible power. if Citadel goes under, the U.S economy is at jeopardy. </p>
<p><strong>Step Two:</strong> </p>
<p>What’s next? </p>
<ol>
<li>u/atobitt presents the briefing notes that was shared with Reps. Walk them through the deck LIVE on YouTube to ensure everyone is on the same page (10-15 minutes)</li>
<li>Dr. Trimbath would pick one critical topic that is in line with our findings to unpack (10 minutes) </li>
<li>Silverback Dave would pick another complex issue in line with our findings to unpack and break down to the most digestible form.  </li>
<li>Reps will then have the floor to ask questions (30 minutes). Depending on the nature of the questions, Silverback Dave and Dr. Queen Kong will step in to address any concern or/and to confirm our findings. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I propose to bring Dr. Trimbath and Dave onboard because:</strong>  </p>
<ol>
<li>We will look professional and credible, we are not just mad redditors attempting to break the world’s economy like people think. </li>
<li>We actually do care to have free and fair market to all</li>
<li>We are merging experience (Dave) with Education (Dr. Trimbth). This benefits them by educating people on a very complex topics that if left unnoticed, it will have dire consequences for all. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Would it be possible to get all these people in one room (virtually)?</strong> </p>
<p>We have almost half million in both GME and Superstonk, if 10,000 Apes tweet these people, I think we will gain their attention. I am confident we can put all these minds in one room. <strong>Let’s do it now.</strong> </p>
<p>Now, how do we get started… If it was up to me to manage this assignment, I would task u/atobitt and Hank69 plus 2 other members of DD writers to put together the <strong>Master DD and the PowerPoint</strong> presentation. Then we assign someone to put this into a digestible, nicely written package for politicians (briefing note/policy memo). Email the reps and CC both Dr. Queen Kong and Silverback Dave. Wait for their response to schedule a LIVE meeting. </p>
<p>Please feel free to provide feedback, recommendations, or suggestions.</p>
<p>Edit 1: I am simply responding to mod's u/luridess comment:
I respectfully disagree. We can share information with members of congress as "concerned citizens". Hence, I said to mark the briefing note "for information" not "for action". We are simply trying to unpack our complex DDs and share it with policy makers supported by Dr. Trimbath and Dave. It will be up to policy makers to take action or not. But at least we tried. Educating policy makers shouldn't be viewed as "manipulation or foreign influence".</p>
<p>Edit 2: after adding Edit 1, the photo of members of congress disappeared. Not sure why.</p>
<p>Edit 3: my inbox exploded, apes are reaching out to support this initiative. Some of you even work as a political staff in the congress and willing to share contact information of their respective officials and get them involved. This is what we need "educate officials and people in power, nothing more or less." This is literally the finest community on the internet.</p>
<p>Edit 4: As you probably saw, the majority of Reps didn't ask the questions that matter. That's because in my opinion,  they don't understand the issue to begin with. If you don't understand the issue, how are you going to address it or even talk about it to make appropriate changes?</p>
<p>The purpose of this post is to manage our combined energy and direct it in the proper channel to bring about positive change. Don't get me wrong, I am a mememaker myself, but when things get serious I will step in to help. We have great writers, big minds, economists, lawyers, and individuals  who work closely with officials, like myself. If we roll up our sleeves, put our minds together and bring different expertise to the table, we will accomplish a lot of things. No manipulation here, just education.</p>
