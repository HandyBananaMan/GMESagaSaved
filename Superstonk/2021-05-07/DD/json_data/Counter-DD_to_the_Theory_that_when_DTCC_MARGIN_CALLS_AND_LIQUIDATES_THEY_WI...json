I am considering working on something more of an evolved form of this one, tying together good DDs and conclusions that i have missed, new findings, etc. As I am not adept in the art of posting yet (and threw this together a little too quickly), feel free to over any feedback on structural/format improvements, meme feedback, everything. The next version of this is certain to be better in these areas, but the more exposure i get, the better i can make it. Thanks everyone so far.\n\nAlso, sorry for all caps. I will try to dial my tits back a couple levels on the next one.\n\nEND TOP EDIT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHello follow apes,\n\nTried to get this out before OPEN , buut oh well.\n\nAnyway, this is my first posted \"DD\", which I put together as a follow-up to some conversations within an [earlier cross-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6ojw7/fellow_apes_and_wrinkle_brains_this_post_got_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I made last night I threw in r/superstonk (check it out if you want to see some of the preliminary dialogue and my initial reasoning). I am no stranger to performing Due Diligence, though it is not something I generally broadcast so everyone can see how stupid I am, but I decided to make an exception in this case (my chronic Jackedtothetitzinitus was acting up I guess so I took a night to research a bit and braind-ump). Before going into the fluff and finally the DD (that you will need to lower your expectations on before reading), this is what I am digging into.\n\nWHY DID I TAKE A SHOT AT THIS:\n\nI decided to pursue this DD off of the following comment during of the DTCC CEO during the 5/6 congressional hearing:\n\n**Is it true that the \"DTCC Computer\" really doesn't care about price?**\n\n>**DTCC CEO Bodson, \"if a clearing member defaults between trade date and settlement date DTCC uses that collateral(margin) to complete that defaulting member's trades no matter how much price may have changed\"**\n\n[Original post I started from](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n6gs8t/is_it_true_that_the_dtcc_computer_really_doesnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), posted by u/a_hopeless_rmntic\n\nThe main reason I wanted to dig further is due to his word choice. **\u201cDTCC uses that collateral(margin) to complete that defaulting member's trades no matter how much price may have changed\u201d**. I believe that this statement is generally understood/accepted and supported by evidence. Basically, the \u201cDTCC Computer\u201d go brrr as it rampages through and liquidates the assets of a Defaulted Member (like Shitadel for the sake of the example). BUT\n\n1. WHAT IS NOT CLEAR, IS WHETHER OR NOT THE DTCC/NSCC CHANGES THIS NUCLEAR APPROACH IF THEY RUN OUT OF COLLATERAL FROM THE DEFAULTER TO LIQUIDATE AND WHETHER THEY SHIFT TO MORE STRATGEGIC (or different) METHOD OF COVERING IN A CASE WHERE THE ASSETS THEY LIQUIDATED ARE UNABLE TO COVER ANYWHERE NEAR THE TRUE TOTAL COST TO CLOSE ALL OF THE POSITIONS (such as when a short squeeze rocket is blasting off due to the rapid buy pressure in real-time and low liquidity #diamodehands).\n2. Given that this is potentially one aspect that can affect the peak of the squeeze, whether positively or negatively, I thought it would be worth digging into a bit more so that we can enhance the predictability of how the MOASS will play out and clear up any group-think (unbacked \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d) and route out as much speculation (theories/statements not backed with evidence) and FUD as we can.\n\nThis post is here to help us all tighten as many knots as in our collective DD pre-MOASS as possible and is in no way intended establish or perpetuate any fear/uncertainty/doubt. The goal really is to oppose and combat FUD, but I recognize that this is a sensitive question/topic, and relies on a little bit of faith due to the unprecedented nature of this insane situation we are in. In any case, I look forward to responding to you glorious apes.\n\nNow, starting with a little fluff. Note that most of this DD is not me uncovering new information. It is mainly me asking targeted questions with context so that we can collectively evolve and refine our DD, so there may be some value in reading through some of it (to get a feel for where my head is at basically).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSTART: FLUFF and non-DD CONTEXT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[the day my life changed, - $GME GO BRRR - u\\/SomeGuyInDeutchland](https://preview.redd.it/my369gtwipx61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7785c98c777763514153f910c17cc1e4c9ffa21c)\n\nI know many of you are in the same situation as me, but I just wanted to mention that this \\^\\^ was the day I got into the GME infinity war (and honestly legitimately into reddit for that matter), and like many of you, I have learned so much about finance and markets since Jan that my tits are permanently jacked, my brain is smooth, my tendies are baking, and I helped my wife find her boyfriend(s). Oh, and most importantly: hedgies r fuk.\n\n* Credit to u/SomeGuyInDeutchland for this absolute banger of a billboard and baller move that sparked my ape-instincts (that post still owns the all time spot on r/wallstreetbets btw).\n\nA couple more side details, I am committed to holding GME literally until I know Shitadel goes bankrupt, and I don\u2019t really care at what price that happens. What I do care about is that we collectively understand what CAN help or hurt the MOASS (i.e., responses from the DTCC/NSCC), so that all apes have a good idea on where this will realistically peak as the situation evolves). There may be no guarantees in this crazy world, but I think the least we can do is eliminate a few toxic market participants while all making some tendies as long as we remain informed.\n\nThat being said,\n\n1. DO NOT BE GENTLE IN ATTEMPTING TO COUNTER THIS (the only emotion I feel anymore is tits-jacked, and I am not even sure that is a real emotion, and I value sincerity, constructive criticism, and truth (no matter how raw) much more than things like modesty, coddling, and sugarcoating). CALL OUT ANY BULL SH\\*T/MISUNDERSTANDINGS YOU SEE, AND I WILL EDIT AS MORE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED). ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU DO NOT QUICKLY DISMISS WHAT I HAVE OBERVED TO BE A COMMONLY ASKED/ANSWERED QUESTION WITH NO EVIDENCE BACK IT UP, EITHER BY CITING A CASE OR AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT DUE TO THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THE SITUATION, AS WELL AS DTCC RULE UPDATES.\n2. If you are looking to present a serious argument/feedback around any piece, please present some form of context (hard evidence, which is quite elusive in this case) backing it up/explaining your position so we can continue to refine our collective DD, establishing fact while cutting out speculation wherever we can. I will do my best to form this with as much fact and verbatim references as I can to keep my smooth brain from getting in the way, most of which come from the [DTCC's Recovery and Wind-down Plan](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2018/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2017-017-Amendment.pdf), but I will also summarize my thoughts in these areas so that the smarter apes can counter my perception.\n3. I am not here to speculate on any dates, patterns, prices, or even specific stocks, and this is of course not financial/legal advice, I am not a financial/legal advisor, disclaimer 3, disclaimer 4, etc. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEND: FLUFF and non-DD CONTEXT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSTART: SITUATION CONTEXT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n This thesis is being presented in the frame of this \u201chypothetical situation\u201d:\n\nPart 1: Shitadel got Margin Called and **cannot** satisfy requirements, and the necessary time has passed for the situation to have transcended to the point that the NSCC (part of DTCC that would handles this type of thing) has taken the wheel and is nuking all their assets in order to cover a position so beyond-stupid, that they will make the 10 or so people on r/wallstreetfails look like actual rocket scientists.\n\nPart 2: Though NSCC has liquified (I prefer this term over \u201cliquidated\u201d) to cover what they could, they have run out of Shitadel collateral from the Margin Call, AND ARE NOT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE FITTING THE BILL FOR THIS CLUSTERFU\\*K.\n\nThe thesis is more specifically focused on theorizing \u201cwhat happens after Part 2\u201d, which appears to be unprecedented even at a smaller scale (A Market Maker with a massive short position collapsing). Side note, I can\u2019t even find cases of this happening on a smaller scale with the DTCC/NSCC, which I imagine is a bit different than when a bank Margin Calls an individual or a hedge fund (We saw Credit Suisse take the tit-punch for Archegos, but Archegos is obviously not a MM).\n\n1. We know DTCC/NSCC will torch all the the margin called assets, liquidate, and sell\n2. We also know when that runs out, there are other assets (Real estate, furniture, wendys coupons, etc. they can also give NSCC more fuel to cover themselves\n\nBut what happens when that is gone >.>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEND: SITUATION CONTEXT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSTART: General Thesis\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**WTF am I posting about:**\n\nWhat I am calling into question is the seemingly-widely accepted theory/statement that, IN THE EVENT OF A MARGIN CALL THAT CANNOT BE SATISFIED such as one on Shitadel, the DTCC/NSCC will basically let their \u201ccomputers\u201d go HAM (hard as a montherfu\\*kr) and essentially go out and buy everything that it can to cover the MANY short positions, and liquidate (or \u201cliquify\u201d as I like to say) as much of the collateral of the Defaulting Member (Shitadel) as necessary, and will continue to cover after this point in the same manner, propelling the stock so far out of orbit that, indeed, many of us will be hospitalized for a non-fatal by life changing condition (or chronic condition in my case) that will be come to be known as Jackedtothetitzinitus, or \u201cJacked to the Tits Syndrome\u201d depending on where you read about it.\n\nThesis:\n\nAlthough the DTCC/NSCC may INDEED let the bots wreck everything the Defaulting Member (Shitadel) has to offer in order to cover the exposure (AKA the Ginnungagap) at whatever price they need to (indiscriminately), THEY **MAY** NOT NECESSARILY CONTINUE LETTING THE COMPUTERS RAMPAGE THE COVERING OF SHORTS ONCE IT STARTS EASTING INTO THEIR OWN CASH\n\nI am not suggesting they will shut down the squeeze, but I am entertaining the possibility that the DTCC/NSCC has a few moves that effectively will allow them to \u201cUnwind\u201d the sh\\*t show in a more controlled manner.\n\nWhy am I entertaining this possibility (note that I am not making any statement, just presenting something to be proven or disproven:\n\nI have been reading through [DTCC's Recovery and Wind-down Plan](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2018/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2017-017-Amendment.pdf) and its amendments, and see enough loose language to tell that, at the least, this is not a black or white outcome. There seems to be a fair amount of language that specifically seems to be there to account short liquidity risks and short squeezes, as well as other market phenomenon\u2019s.\n\nSince a DTCC Margin Call resulting in total liquidation of a MM seems to be unprecedented, it is hard to predict what power \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c will have at this level, although we can be sure that \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c will DEFINITELY delete the mofo getting margin called.\n\nIs there a Kenneth Griffin in the house?

The Recovery Plan would describe tools, actions, and related governance for both market risk monitoring and liquidity risk monitoring through this phase. For example, in connection with managing its market risk during this phase, NSCC would, pursuant to the Rules, (1) monitor and assess the adequacy of Clearing Fund resources; (2), when necessary and appropriate pursuant to the Rules, assess and collect additional margin requirements; and (3) follow its operational procedures to liquidate the Defaulting Member\u2019s portfolio. Management of liquidity risk through this phase would involve ongoing monitoring of the adequacy of NSCC\u2019s liquidity resources, and the Recovery Plan would identify certain actions NSCC may deploy as it deems necessary to mitigate a potential liquidity shortfall, which would include, for example, adjusting its strategy for closing out the Defaulting Member\u2019s portfolio or seeking additional liquidity resources. The Recovery Plan would state that, throughout this phase, relevant information would be escalated and reported to both internal management committees and the Board Risk Committee.**\n\nPart of my knowledge gap is around the concept of this Crisis Continuum. My single-digit-wrinkle brain cannot tell if they comprehensively defined WTF the Crisis Continuum is, as I only ever see them mention it is if it is a clearly known/defined thing. To me, is sounds like being in a perpetual  All I could find was on page 11.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[wot?](https://preview.redd.it/mb7i876vhpx61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=86683d3bdbd623749fb9d1451a126122f441604d)\n\nIt seems like my original thought was a little different. Below is a real Crisis Continuum\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Short's Version of the Crisis Continuum](https://preview.redd.it/7dwgtwurhpx61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=4db010a2d0b4ad1eb99e5e7c7715608872773ae3)\n\nJust a little more copy/paste-able detail:\n\n>**Managing Member Default Losses and Liquidity Needs Through the Crisis Continuum. The Recovery Plan would describe the risk management surveillance, tools, and governance that NSCC may employ across an increasing stress environment, which is referred to as the \u201cCrisis Continuum.\u201d This description would identify those tools that can be employed to mitigate losses, and mitigate or minimize liquidity needs, as the market environment becomes increasingly stressed. The phases of the Crisis Continuum would include (1) a stable market phase, (2) a stress market phase, (3) a phase commencing with NSCC\u2019s decision to cease to act for a Member or Affiliated Family of Members (referred to in the Plan as the \u201c Member default phase\u201d), 20 and (4) a recovery phase.**\n\nSo, an \u201cincreasing stress environment\u201d you say? Thanks DTCC/NSCC for the overwhelming clarity and lack of vagueness in a term that has the work \u201cCRISIS\u201d and \u201cCONTIUUM\u201d in it. I don\u2019t suppose a squeezen \\[sic\\] of biblical, tit-shattering proportion would qualify as an environment situation tied to this definition, would it?\n\nPerhaps a similar situation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[hmm? something not quite right?](https://preview.redd.it/3ibf8gkqhpx61.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e1a54a283dcf06c30b527621fd9821f65f75a6f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ah okay. yeah dont worry NSCC, it is definitely wrong. It is missing some zeros at the end \ud83d\ude0e](https://preview.redd.it/023j9rophpx61.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=3eb4373b12f05981088e89138be6daa2c62963a0)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnyway, due to how loose the definition, I imagine that NSCC can associate this \u201cCrisis Continuum\u201d with affectively any situation that a lawyer can spin in court, however, I can only assume that the evidence of the situation would have to be pretty compelling if this \u201cCrisis Continuum\u201d concept extends traditional/common flexibility in how the NSCC or DTCC responds to defaulting member and other cases like that.\n\nI cannot say that this concept really changes much (or anything, as we are going in knowing that they are going to try to NOT break the markets if possible). I am mainly bringing it up because I feel It could be a curveball, or a concept that is used by the NSCC to justify what could be undesirable for team \u201cMOASS\u201d and hurt the squeezen. The only other point is that even if there was a precedented case of a similar situation (short squeeze TIER: tit-shattering), it would not necessarily be enough to predict exactly how the DTCC/NSCC would navigate, and what actions will hurt/help the squeeze (primarily the peak).\n\nI think we will need to be prepared for a situation where the squeeze unravels in a slow-burn manner to account for the expected amount of liquidity (this could potentially be different if a catalyst took us all by surprise (harder to plan around)), but without one, I can only assume NSCC want to try to drag it out at a certain point. GME will squeeze, but it could be a slow ride up to the top (slow meaning +X% per day, kind of like the TSLA squeeze, but more volatile, but I am just speculating off of the many posts of DD by our mega brains)\n\nSome more detail I though was work highlighting from the \u201cRecovery Plan\u201d in regards to a member default (which is what this theory is assuming):\n\n>**\u201cThe Recovery Plan would also identify financial resources available to NSCC, pursuant to the Rules, to address losses arising out of a Member default. Specifically, Rule 4, as proposed to be amended by the Loss Allocation Filing, would provide that losses remaining after application of the Defaulting Member\u2019s resources be satisfied first by applying a \u201cCorporate Contribution,\u201d and then, if necessary, by allocating remaining losses among the membership in accordance with such Rule 4. 28\u201d**  \n>  \n>*-Page 13 of* [The Rules](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf)  \n>  \n>**\u201cSee supra note 6. The Loss Allocation Filing proposes to amend Rule 4 to define the amount NSCC would contribute to address a loss resulting from either a Member default or a non-default event as the \u201cCorporate Contribution.\u201d This amount would be 50 percent (50%) of the \u201cGeneral Business Risk Capital Requirement,\u201d which is calculated pursuant to the Capital Policy and is an amount sufficient to cover potential general business losses so that NSCC can continue operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize, in compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) under the Act. See also supra note 4; 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(e)(15).\u201d**  \n>  \n>*-Reference 28 from page 13*\n\nMore law words. Also in the R&R Plan, they reference [The Rules](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf) a lot, (Rule 4 specifically). I tried to decipher the most relevant pieces, but I might be a bit out of my depth in applying the parts of Rule 4 to this exact situation, so I will not attempt that just yet. I thought it was worth including the above quotes from the R&W Plan, as it seems to be focused around \u201chow\u201d (at a high-level), NSCC would address a member default situation.\n\nMy takeaway, assuming I am not misinterpreting things, is that there was that there is something called a \u201cCorporate Contribution\u201d (seemingly a contribution fund FROM NSCC TO HELP ACCOUNT FOR A DEFAULTED MEMBER IN CERTAIN CASES), whose value is based on something called the \u201cGeneral Business Risk Capital Requirement\u201d.\n\nBasically, I believe this \u201cContribution\u201d is basically there to be the first layer of effort/protection handling any remaining outstanding debts of a Defaulting Member (looking your way Shitadel). Though they elaborate on how this Corporate Contribution amount is calculated, I am not certain what the exact dollar amount is at the moment (Maybe a wrinkle-brain has an idea?), **AND I AM ESPECIALLY NOT SURE OF HOW RECKLESS/CAREFUL THE NSCC WOULD BE WITH THIS CONTRIBUTION WHEN COVERING THE REST OF THE SHORT POSITIONS IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE LIQUIDITY IS DRY AND THAT BUY PRESSURE FROM COVERING IS GOING TO CAUSE THE PRICE TO RUB AGAINST SOME OTHER PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.**\n\n\\^REMEMBER, this DD is more focused around whether NSCC will be more strategic in covering the short positions once they are playing with THEIR MONEY, assuming they end up having to (which I am betting they will). According to the DTCC guy on thec congress youtube\n\nThese were a couple new terms for me that others might be able to expand on:\n\n\u201cGeneral Business Risk Capital Requirement\u201d According to page 31 of [DTCC's Recovery and Wind-down Plan](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2018/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2017-017-Amendment.pdf)\n\n>**The Wind-down Plan would also provide that the estimate would be the \u201cRecovery/Wind-down Capital Requirement\u201d under the Capital Policy. Under that policy, the General Business Risk Capital Requirement, which is the sufficient amount of LNA that NSCC should hold to cover potential general business losses so that it can continue operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize, is calculated as the greatest of three estimated amounts, one of which is this Recovery/Wind-down Capital Requirement. Therefore, NSCC believes the R&W Plan, as it interrelates with the Capital Policy, is consistent with Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii).66**\n\n\u201cCorporate Contribution\u201d as per Rule 4 Sec 5 in [The Rules](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf):\n\n>**Corporate Contribution. For any loss allocation pursuant to Section 4 of this Rule, whether arising out of or relating to a Defaulting Member Event or a Declared Non-Default Loss Event, the Corporation\u2019s corporate contribution to losses or liabilities that are incurred by the Corporation with respect to an Event Period (\u201cCorporate Contribution\u201d) shall be an amount that is equal to fifty (50) percent of the amount calculated by the Corporation in respect of its General Business Risk Capital Requirement as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the Event Period.**\n\nI also wanted to note that the second paragraph of section 5 at least indicates that NSCC is not bound to the upper limit of the Corporate Contribution (The point I want to make here is that, though there may be no theoretical cap on how much they can contribute, but it seems to be discretionary).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[found a coloring area](https://preview.redd.it/bhnn90iwhpx61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab82c7be44a26a42218928a9348624da518b9d41)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEND: DD (Documented Data and Takeaways, not conclusions)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSTART: Concluding Questions (with some fun titles)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTHE BIG QUESTIONS:\n\n1. \\*\\*\u201dIs this how Maximum Overdrive and Horizon Zero Dawn Started?\u201d\\*\\*Are we certain that the DTCC Computers are going to continue to buy at any price, even after they have exhasueted the Liqufied assets of the member they margin-called, even if it totally wrecks the DTCC\u2019s Emergency fund that they never seem to have used?\n\na. Like at the top, this is around the DTCC CEOs quote, which confirms our knowledge that bots and GME will go brrr as long as they are playing with the margin and collateral they took\n\n2. \\*\\*\u201cWhoops, ran out of Shitadel solvent, does that mean we have to use ours?\u201d\\*\\*In the event that the Liquified, defaulted member\u2019s assets are not enough to cover and complete all outstanding trades, will the DTCC/NSCC stop and try to more strategically \u201cunwind\u201d the cluster-fu\\*k so that they minimize their damage?\n\na. Note that I am aware of this XX Trillion dollar \u201cemergency/insurance fund\u201d, but since it doesn\u2019t seem like the DTCC has ever had to use it (at least not on a scale like this, not considering the new rules), we cannot associate fundamentally different-but-kinda similar, precedented and just assume that we know how they will leverage that fund\n\nb. There seems to be a fair amount of language around Liquidity Risks and the Crisis Continuum that makes me think they are going to have angles to navigate a squeeze in a way that reduces the power of \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n3. \\*\\*\u201cWhat even is Corporate Contribution? Just kidding, what is it like a bus or something?\u201d\\*\\*Can the DTCC or NSCC effectively \u201ccap\u201d how much more money they are going to throw in to cover a defaulting member with what is basically theoretical minimum dollar amount (Shitadel Liquified assets + NSCC Corporate Contribution)?\n\na. One of the areas I am hoping to get extra feedback on\n\n4. \\*\\*\u201cSomebody better give me my money or ima bust a tit\u201d\\*\\*What happens if cost to cover is greater than liquefied assets + Corporate Contribution and they decide to exercise discretion and NOT DUMP MORE MONEY INTO IT?\n\na. Would this be a situation like (everybody gets the same xyx payout per share) while we unravel the synthetics, fraud, HF tears, etc.\n\nb. Note, I believe that NSCC/DTCC capping the squeeze is unlikely here, but I do believe they will change tactics once they are playing with their own money, going from SPRAY\u2019N\u2019PRAY Mode on GME with buy orders (when they are using Liquified assets from the one getting pounded by Marge N. Call), to SNIPER Mode (or they will lay out a plan as part of their \u201cRecovery Phase\u201d)\n\n5. \\*\\*\u201cI am Sick and Tire of these MothaFu\\*kin Shorts in this MothaFu\\*kin Market\u201d\\*\\*Not a question, but we all know a lot of market participants want this saga over.

It is reasonable to think that they will start to unwind positions differently than how most us expect (DTTC Computers go BRRR until all shorts are covered, regardless of price) once they are done burning all of the assets they just liquidated to cover the shorts positions.\n\nWhat we know for sure is that the \u201cDTCC Computers\u201d do not care about price \u201cWHEN THEY ARE COMPLETING TRADES WITH THE LIQUFIED ASSETS OF THE DEFAULTING MEMBER\u201d, but that does not necessarily carry over to when that initial amount of money runs out and they are on their own. Since it doesn\u2019t seem like a DTCC Margin Call has ever happened where NSCC ran out of money to cover and had to fit the bill (at least not at a scale like this), it is hard to say for sure how much influence \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c will dictate the price.\n\nAlthough\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c will certainly be enough to bankrupt Shitadel and anyone else who gets called. We need to look into the other moves that the DTCC and NSCC has available to them in order to keep them from getting totally jacked (keep in mind these rules are being implemented to also protect DTCC and their subs).\n\nI look forward to the feedback guys, I hope it was worth a read.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEND: TLDR\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHODL GME to the MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSTART: BOTTOM EDIT\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFormat\n\n1.

And yes, it has me Jacked to the fucking tits. \n\nu/Far_Box_7843\n____\n\"The DTCC will do what is the most efficient method for buying back shares and in the case of a short squeeze that means turning their super computers on full blast and buying back every single share necessary until there is a gaping hole through the center of the earth above where those super computers used to be. I will explain. There is no more frugal method for this. That is kind of what the definition of a short squeeze is. I think that people are getting confused because of Citadels actions, however, there is no better method for saving money than to buy back every share no matter the price. If Citadel were able to be solvent after doing so the price would be in the millions right this second. But there is no way for Citadel to survive this so they are prolonging as much as possible trying to survive for as many seconds as possible by continuing the spiral of shorting GME. There are two things that you are forgetting: 1.) Interest payments for shares not returned and what occurs when a stock goes up and down in price more typically. 2.) Both of these things will prevent the DTCC from prolonging this process because they want to spend as little money as possible.                                    Firstly, the DTCC will want to avoid interest payments as much as possible. Remember, as price goes up interest payments increase as well. This fact would make it entirely unreasonable for the DTCC to say, \"welp the price is $30,000 lets stop for today and wait for a better one\".                                                Secondly, if the DTCC were to stop at $30,000 for the day and wait to buy back at a better price despite interest, there is no reasonable guarantee that the price would decrease. DTCC is not going to short the price of GME because to do so would require borrowing more shares and subsequently having to pay more interest on those shares. Again, Citadel is only doing so because they surviving for as long as possible. Not doing so would be accepting their fait and jumping off the cliff. To put it more simply, launching GME into orbit is the most frugal method, it is essentially the definition of a short squeeze.\"\n_____\n\nThere you have it. If I had one goal after being compelled to rewrite this DD, it was to walk away with something like this. One legitimate, overwhelmingly reasonable argument backed by reason or evidence that DTCC might just let their super computers which I will here unto  referr to as the \"OMEGA BRRR CLUSTER\", do what they do best... go BRRR in a way that will make Jerome Powell's money printer look like a total bitch. \n\nYou may think I am overreacting, and that is fine, but if you are a true critical thinker/problem solver and are semi-versed in the context, you will recognize that this argument falls within the golden ratio of practicality and simplicity, AND it may actually be the cheapest option for them. I certainly intend to expand on this in my next DD, but in truth, I think we may now what DTCCs best option in. I can't wait to see the arguments for an against the idea as we narrow down what moves DTCC has. \n\n\n^^^READ THE ABOVE^^^ (u/Far_Box_7843 statement)\n\nWondering what would my advice be at this time?
