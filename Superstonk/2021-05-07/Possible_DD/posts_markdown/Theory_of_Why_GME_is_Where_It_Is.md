I'm new to this DD thing, I came into this GME saga barely knowing what the fuck was going on, so please bare with me.

You may have seen my post about [801 and the NSCC-002](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5idj9/801_and_nscc002/) the other day mentioned in the Daily, or my update on the [NSCC-002](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6zgng/nsc002_delayed_for_longer_period_of_comment_and/) filing being postponed until June 21st.

I'm going to make this as easy for apes to understand, and will be active in the comments section to inevitably fill in the gaps I am going to leave.

# GME Is Not Being Held Down By Kenny G Right Now

I know, we love the Kenny G memes, but in my mind it's not true. 

A lot of speculation has gone on in other DDs about why this is, so I'll defer to [the masterpieces](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mkvgew/why_are_we_trading_sideways_why_is_the_borrow/) of DD. 

From my personal knowledge of Wall Street, their past actions, and the delayed filings and joke of a hearing, it seems to me that Blackrock, the SEC, the DTC, FINRA, and Citadel are all working together to sort out this shit show for THEM. Most likely Citadel is working with the SEC and others to allow them to move assets, secure positions, and get things in the best possible shape for THEM before unwinding. In exchange, they may get lower fines, or immunity altogether from the DoJ when this comes to a head.

The volume is low, apes are holding and buying here and there, and Blackrock/Market Makers are more or less the only ones moving GME, along with general trading Algos that may pick up on GME. Shorts may be borrowed by Blackrock or others to keep the price steady and closed (legitimately) by the end of the day.

We have to truly understand that we ARE in a completely fradulent system. 

# So What's Next, NSCC-002 is delayed?

It is becoming increasingly clear to me that all players from the financial industry side are playing for themselves. They are working on making sure the exposure is as limited as possible (or perhaps as profitable as possible) and contained. It is a known fact Citadel will go under, how do they go from there and how do they benefit and do their jobs the best. 

If we rule out that the SEC will do anything for investors, we can begin to see 2 timelines form. The apes and papa Cohen, and the lifting of the brakes from the DTC/SEC.

# Papa Cohen Takes Over

One way that the MOASS can start is by forcing the financial regulatory agencies to hop out of the car entirely. This can only be done with a large investor base and coordinated plays. The shareholder meeting on 6/9 seems to be that. If 1.) The total votes received exceeds the float count then it is clear and impervious evidence that naked shorting exists. Once that is established 2.) A reverse merger or a stock split can force the shorts to cover. There is a lot of reasons why a stock split causes this, but essentially your 10 shares may become 20, may become 30, may become 50; and this is the same for Shorts. Their 200 million shorts may become 1 billion... and that will most certainly force a margin call from a financial perspective. These shares will have to be returned as well, and FTDs in a stock split are deadly, lethal, and will have immediate effect. 

If a split is announced at 6/9, we would need effectively 0 regulations to pass for MOASS to start, and they would be FUCKED.

# Cohen forgoes split, SEC/DTC wait for Regulations

This is the other way MOASS may happen, with the DD already being everywhere I won't harp on it. 

Essentially, we wait for OCC-003 and OCC-004 (I think, numbers are hard for ape) and DTC-005 to pass, this insulates the crash, allows other members to keep their crash, and fucks citadel with the entire girth of ape cock. They would then be incentivized to release the brake, allow buying pressure to come back through the regular exchanges, and perhaps whales will feel comfortable hopping in as well.

All in all, we are looking at another month or so of hodling, no target dates. Vote and Hodl. Always.

# TL;DR: Papa Cohen has a chance to say fuck the SEC/DTC and start the rocket on his own, minimum date for that happening is the shareholder meeting. Otherwise we vote and hodl until OCC-003, 004 and DTC-005 are put into place. The system is fraudulent, Kenny G is not shorting, they're just letting the chess timer hit 0 before accepting loss.
