Corruption, lies, clueless fucks getting bought off, we already knew this. \n\nWe\u2019re still in the game and need to stay focused on what\u2019s really important, the stock. \n\nSome apes mentioned they don\u2019t want to bring politics into the sub, there\u2019s an argument for both sides there. I don\u2019t have an opinion just yet, but if it has to do specifically with gme then it\u2019s fair game no?",
