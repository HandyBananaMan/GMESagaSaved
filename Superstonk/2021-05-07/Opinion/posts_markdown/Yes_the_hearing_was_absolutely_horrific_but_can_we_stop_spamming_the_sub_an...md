I’m disappointed too, nothing surprised me yesterday. Corruption, lies, clueless fucks getting bought off, we already knew this. 

We’re still in the game and need to stay focused on what’s really important, the stock. 

Some apes mentioned they don’t want to bring politics into the sub, there’s an argument for both sides there. I don’t have an opinion just yet, but if it has to do specifically with gme then it’s fair game no?
