tl;dr Reckless naked shorting IMO guarantees that r/superstonk owns bare minimum the whole float. You all better be as greedy as me with a 20M floor. 



This might come across as harsh but here we go. I, like many of you was a part of the crowd that would have accepted a lot less money back in January if they had let it squeeze back then. But not now. I’m no longer in this for any small amount of money. The HFs need to be bled dry and we all need to become filthy rich. I’ve been getting royally pissed about how people are begging for new DD and how they need constant reassurance that the squeeze is still on. You’ve all been watching the same ticker as me. How the hell would they have covered with us watching like vultures?? They’ve been shorting it to oblivion the past 4 **months** and people are showing that they either have not read or don’t understand the DD. Back then we were just passengers along for a ride on the back of whales like BlackRock but now I have no doubt that our beloved r/superstonk owns at bare minimum, the float. We will set our price and it will be extremely expensive. The SHFs continue to test our patience with their naked shorts and many institutions are complicit. By now you should know, regardless of how many SHFs are bankrupted, the DTCC is on the hook to cover. I want it all. They’re insured for $60T(probably more given liquidations of SHFs and etc) and I want all of you to be as greedy as me. All the shit we put up with was not worth it unless we are all filthy rich. My floor is 20M you all better be as greedy as me.



Pre-emptive edit: if you feel targeted, good I am talking to you. You better not paper hand and ruin it for us. Fuck the HFs. Fuck the MSM. Fuck everyone that is making us wait. Diamond your hands the fuck up and get rich with me.
