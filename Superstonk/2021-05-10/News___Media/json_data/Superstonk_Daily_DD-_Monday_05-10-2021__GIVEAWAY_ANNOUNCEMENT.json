However, please keep in mind that [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) is a place for people from around the world to get together to share news, information, memes and comments about stonks.\n\nOur AMAs are for informational purposes only. Our guests are here to inform us and to answer YOUR questions.\n\nWe are not a political group. Mods will not spearhead any political campaign nor will we reach out to any politician on behalf of [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/).\n\nThere are several reasons for this, however the most important ones are:\n\n1. Many of us, including several Mods, are not US citizens.\n2. If [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) reaches out to potentially \"friendly\" or \"open minded\" US politicians to try and \"educate\" or \"inform\" them, this is what will happen:\n   1. Mods and influential [r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk/) users will be targeted as \"bad actors\" who are attempting to exert foreign influence on US politicians and policy; and\n   2. Those politicians we reach out to, who may or may not be friendly, will be targeted as \"compromised\" and \"under foreign influence/manipulation\"\n3. The result? All of a sudden, any positive changes they are attempting to make will be seen as \"an attack on American Sovereignty\" because they are \"compromised\" by \"foreign manipulation\"\n4. Furthermore, politicians are not dumb. **You can bet that many of them are lurking on this sub, reading, watching and learning.** If they want to learn, they can and will do so.\n\n**If you want to get involved, all you have to do is watch our AMA with Dave Lauer or** [**read the transcript**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7295i/david_lauer_ama_transcript_summary_22/)**. Here's a direct copy/paste from the transcript:**\n\n>\\*\\*WHAT CAN WE DO?\\*\\*There have been questions about **what can we do** and to me this is one of those things that we can do.Another thing is you can just continue to make your voice heard, **you can file comment letters with the SEC or FINRA, that's an excellent way to get involved**, they do read them and \\*\\*they do listen to well thought out comments, or well-researched comments.\\*\\*You can contact your members of Congress because these bills that are going to come up are going to be controversial and they need to hear that there are people out there that support them, for good reasons.You can make use of the SEC and Office of the Investor Advocate who is there to advocate on your behalf and is often focused on institutional investors but would probably like to hear more from retail.And Gary Gensler I think in his testimony before Congress is going to say that they're requesting public input on some of these exact issues.So I think getting involved like that is just an *excellent thing*.It's great to have more involvement and more perspectives in this market structure debate, versus most of the people that are involved generally work for the high-frequency firms, the exchanges, the broker-dealersThere are very few of us out there who are not beholden to one of those types of firms and who are making money, actively, off of the current market structure.\n\n**If our American apes wish to contact their representatives as individuals, please do so.**\n\nHowever, the Mod Team will not be contacting anyone on behalf of the community, nor will we be involved with organizing any \"Master DD\", slideshows, or political AMAs.\n\nMany American apes are asking for information/websites/links on how to contact their representatives/SEC/FINRA.\n\n# [Report suspected securities fraud to SEC](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)\n\n# [File a complaint with FINRA](https://www.finra.org/investors/have-problem/file-complaint)\n\n# [Report Fraud to the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/submit-consumer-complaint-ftc)\n\n[But imma keep doing it anyway](https://preview.redd.it/9vcoe657b7y61.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=102e874a1437684ce8f9326932799b0cedd14bcb)\n\nAlso, here's a message from [u/redchessqueen99](https://www.reddit.com/u/redchessqueen99/):\n\n\"This subreddit is public space. I think that's even true, legally considering. People all over the world come to reddit and join public forums. We won't condone anything against our rules.Politics must be relevant to the discussion. There are private chat groups and messaging alternatives for those who truly wish to organize.This subreddit is geared toward public discussion and sharing of knowledge and education.This is not a place to organize action on the political battlefield.However, if those organized actions rely on information gained from [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk) or other subreddits, that will not be on other community members or the moderators.We are here to facilitate public discourse, not censor information or discussion on the grounds of supposed involvement.**In the end, we all have free will and free speech, and we moderators seek to keep the peace and nurture public discussion, not police it or censor it without good reason.** \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.......With that said...\n\n# An update has been made to Rule 5, Improper Content:\n\n**No political posts.
