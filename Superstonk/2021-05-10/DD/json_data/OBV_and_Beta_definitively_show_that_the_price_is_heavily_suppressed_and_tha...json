    "selftext": "Hey there, dildos and dildettes. I normally keep my DD to myself and my friends, but if I can convince my cautious anchor to reality that GME is going to the moon, maybe I can help you do the same. \n\nIf you don't have someone keeping you grounded and real, you should. Fiery passion only beats cold hard facts in Julie Garwood novels and succubus hentai. \n\n**OBV**\n\nOBV = On Balance Volume and typically it follows the price movement closer than Citadel interns follow this sub for the latest image of Kenneth as an alien covered in nipples. (You fuckin weirdos)\n\nHere's the OBV on some stocks that mean something to normal bipedal hominids:\n\n[FB](https://imgur.com/gallery/4IMydAK)\n\n[NIO](https://imgur.com/gallery/KUbCzyN)\n\n[AAPL](https://imgur.com/gallery/e8smoN5)\n\n[SPY](https://imgur.com/gallery/ucCmYAY)\n\nVery clearly you can see that the price movement and the OBV need to get a room. Now let's look at the OBV of GME. It should have the same line as the one on your RH homepage right?\n\n[DatBoi OBV](https://imgur.com/gallery/mldjnYn)\n\nFuckin WRONG. Now I know what you're thinking:\n\n>But u/OverlordHippo how can you call us dildos when you didn't even crop your screenshots. \n\nBlow me, I just realized it and I'm not redoing it. \n\n*So, what's the formula that turns numbers into lines here?* Come on now, let's not pretend you'd understand it. Think of it like this though; There are daily posts showing the buy/sell ratio being a win for the Apes. The OBV confirms that.\n\n*What does this mean?* Look at the GME picture again and imagine the price movement continuing the way it should have without the good old fashioned HF fuckery. It looks like it should be sitting around $550.\n\nThat's $550 without any shorts covering. Shorts covering equals = buying. Buying = price goes up. OBV shows buying is dominant, yet price goes down = shorting enough not to just stop it from going up, but to push it down significantly. Tits = Jacked.\n\n**Beta**\n\nWe're not talking about your personality here. We're talking about a stocks relationship with the rest of the market. The market beta value is hard set at a value of 1. \n\nIf a stock has a Beta value greater than 1, it's price will move in relation to the market's movement, but to a greater degree. If a stock has a Beta value lesser than 1, it's price will still move in relation to the market's, but to a lesser degree. It's rare, but a stock can have a negative beta, which means that it has an inverse relationship with the market.\n\nMost stocks hover around the market value. Best buy is 0.82, Amazon is at 1.11, that sort of thing. The stocks within the market as a whole typically move together. You see those posts with all the red squares when the nasdaq has a shit day. Good days and bad days evened out and extraneous events aside (like some CEO gets caught on a zoom conference with a fleshlight/nipple clamp combo in his desk drawer shaped like a scorpion) the market moves in tandem to the stocks that comprise it.\n\nHere's some boomer piece talking about how stocks with low Beta are a great way to hedge your portfolio against market volatility. \n\n[Lowest 5 Beta stocks of the S&P 500](https://www.suredividend.com/low-beta-stocks/)\n\nIn there you'll find such classics as *Johnson and Johnson* and *Proctor and Gamble* the kind of stocks that are less exciting than re-uploading screenshots that you forgot to crop. The point being that the lowest Beta of the SPY is Walmart at 0.36.\n\nThat's the extreme outlier of stocks considered relevant.\n\n[Here's GME](https://www.infrontanalytics.com/fe-EN/34916NU/GameStop-Corp-/Beta)\n\n-5.62... Not just 0.069, not -4.20, but -5.62.\n\nBasically the market could implode and GME is going surfing the waves of the tears of everyone who doesn't have some. Someone should buy an ad on NPR or a commercial during MASH reruns about hedging your portfolio with GME against market volatility. Our granpappy's will be burying shares of GME in the woods behind their houses and shit.\n\n*Are we the boomers now?* I fuckin guess so. It's going to be hilarious saying:\n\n>You should've hedged properly against this volatile market by buying something safe like GME.\n\nSo there it is. Data driven proof of price suppression and certified boomer approval of portfolio hedging strategies against market volatility all wrapped into one tasty package. \n\n**Summary/TLDR**\n\nOBV and Beta definitively show that the price is both heavily suppressed and that GME is a safe haven in a volatile market. Not only are we correct in our reasoning, we're in a financial lifeboat rowing away from the sinking Titanic that is the market. \n\nIf that doesn't convince the skeptics in your life, then name your yachts after them or something. \n\n**TLDR for those who can't read**\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n****\n\n**Edit**: Lots of dildapes out there twiddling their neckbeards and saying things like\n\n>OBV and Beta can't be used to predict price movement, they're made up of data from previous price movements.\n\nCongratulations, you just described literally all of technical analysis. *No shit* it's made of data from the past and present. It's not like it's made up of data from the future, McFly. MACD, RSI, Stochastics, candlestick patterns, and the skidmarks in your briefs are all entirely comprised of prior movements and used to predict future movements. Even the skidmarks. **HELLO** you already almost shit yourself... Are you going to try and sneak out another one?\n\n**Edit Part Deux**: I see a lot of different Beta values being posted from different sources. Yahoo Finance shows -1.94 and the Bloomberg terminal shows -bazillion. *Which is it?* As some have said, some sources don't include AH trading, so who knows. It's probably something closer to zero than the overpriced boomer machine that runs Windows '69. But, with information as it is for us lowly peons of the financial world, who tf knows. You can bet your Shrek box set on the fact that if even Yahoo Finance says it's *pretty* bad, it is really fuckin bad.",
