<p>Well. Imagine GME hits 10mil a share and then you are a very vulnerable target. The tag intention is good, but I think we really need to stop spreading our real pics and accounts.</p>
<p>EDIT: Clarification - I am not talking about being a target for SEC, lawsuits or whatever. I am talking about exposing yourself to your friends, family as a future multimillionaire and yes, also to criminals. Please read the linked post Part 1/1. It is not: „stop talking about GME!“ - it is „keep your real identity private FFS!“.</p>
<p>If in doubt read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/manjyo/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>
