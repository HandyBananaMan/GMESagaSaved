<p>You can smell a shill from a mile away. Even when cloaked in the clothes of the superstonk community, acting like a supposed member of our community with the best interests of the community at heart, their style gives them away. It’s abrasive, aggressive, divisive, angry, upset. It’s all negativity, it’s all about fostering discord and disharmony.</p>
<p>Guess what shills? We ain’t selling!</p>
