    "selftext": "Well. Imagine GME hits 10mil a share and then you are a very vulnerable target. The tag intention is good, but I think we really need to stop spreading our real pics and accounts.\n\nEDIT: Clarification - I am not talking about being a target for SEC, lawsuits or whatever. I am talking about exposing yourself to your friends, family as a future multimillionaire and yes, also to criminals. Please read the linked post Part 1/1. It is not: \u201estop talking about GME!\u201c - it is \u201ekeep your real identity private FFS!\u201c.\n\nIf in doubt read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/manjyo/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nCheers! \ud83d\udc38\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udf66\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd1c",
