But they only managed to make it drop 11%, tomorrow they will try to continue the drop and they may be able or they will not have ammo left.

All the NASDAQ went red, more than likely because SHF where selling their other positions to continue to short GME.

Congratulations to every Ape for holding and buying this dip.

Law of nature: Shorts must cover. And today was anothee day where the SHF added fuel (more shorts) to the MOASS.

See you in the moon!
