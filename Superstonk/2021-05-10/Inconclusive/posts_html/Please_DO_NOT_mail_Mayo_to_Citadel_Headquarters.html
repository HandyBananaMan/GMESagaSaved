<p>I thought I’d head this off before some ape got ideas. This happened with bananas a few weeks ago. That is not something apes need to do. Sending random packages to places opens up another level of problems because they can claim it’s threatening and get FBI and others involved.  GME  hodlers don’t need that type of publicity. Be smart.</p>
<p>edit: dang I was crazy busy all day and couldn’t check the sub. this blew up. Thanks for the rewards. Buy and hodl</p>
