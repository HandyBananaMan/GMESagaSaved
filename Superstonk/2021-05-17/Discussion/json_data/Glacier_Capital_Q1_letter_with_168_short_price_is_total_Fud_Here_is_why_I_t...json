    "selftext": " \n\nThis letter struck us all as very strange. Why would any investment firm take the risk? We all know that even without MOASS that GME is easily worth much more. So this evening I decided to go down this rabbit hole. When google searching the article two things seemed out of place 1) Why was this small HF getting so much play 2) Why is the article/letter was placed with on one web site?\n\nWho is Glacier Capital? They report having 4 employees and located in Luxembourg and have exactly 37 followers on LinkedIn and a reported about 150M under management and are lead by a lawyer turned Fund Manager. There was no Q4 2020, Q3 2020 or Q22020 letter to investors on the company web site so this stuck me as strange as well. Not exactly impressed so far. The company is located at 11-13 bd de la foire Luxembourg, Luxembourg 1528, LU. A pretty standard looking 5 story office building (no drone coverage needed).\n\nSo I decided to see who else has offices in the building. Lots of insurance and financial office as we as a Swiss bank office. But browsing the web sites of the companies lead me to one key find. Vector Asset Management [https://www.vector.lu/en/](https://www.vector.lu/en/). Going the Vector History page lead me to this find \" Vector moves its depository bank from Edmond de Rothschild to **Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) . \"** Now I ask you who holds a major position in RBC none other that **Citadel Investment Group.** The plot thickens as this ape scratches his smooth brain.\n\nFurther exploration of the Vector Asset Management web site shows the profile of the 3 Portfolio Managers for the company. Turns out the profile for Thierry Vandeghinste has this interesting tidbit He holds a Master in Engineering degree and a Master in Applied Economics degree from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and a MBA-degree from the **University of Chicago**. You see where this is going?\n\nSo I decided to check the Shitadel roster to see who was at the University of Chicago Business School at the same time. Well look who I found Matt Culek. Now most of you will be asking who the f is this Matt guy is. Let me introduce you to the COO of Shitadel Securities [https://www.citadelsecurities.com/leadership/matt-culek/](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/leadership/matt-culek/).\n\nIMHO this story is total and absolute FUD. Placed as distraction. Please keep an open mind ask and do not let your confirmation bias get the better of you.\n\nTo the MOON\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nMy Fellow Apes please BUY, HODL and VOTE.
