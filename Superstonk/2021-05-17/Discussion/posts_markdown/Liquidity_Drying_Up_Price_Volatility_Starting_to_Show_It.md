Did some number crunching while bored after work tonight.  Found something that is starting to show how the effects of evaporating liquidity are starting to show themselves.

Over the first four months of 2021, GME has not seen a single day-over-day close-to-close price movement of >10% up or down on lower than 10 million volume.  It's now happened 3 times in the last 6 days.
