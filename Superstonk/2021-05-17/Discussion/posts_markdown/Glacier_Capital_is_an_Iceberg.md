Alright folks. Someone probably already did this but if not, do I have a treat for you!

So I’ve never heard of this Glacier Capital and the set up for was real SUS. But SUS for another reason.

*Drum roll*

The majority owner of Glacier Capital is 

SUSQUEHANNA CAPITOL GROUP

So that’s crazy right? One of the already sus players is now setting up their scapegoat.

Who has connections with Glacier and Sus?

The main boss Citadel. These turds are just dumb adds. Fodder snipe celly bros
