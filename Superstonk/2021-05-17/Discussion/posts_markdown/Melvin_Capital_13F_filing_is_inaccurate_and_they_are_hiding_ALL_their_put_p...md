Melvin Capital previously showed a 6,000,000 put position on GameStop. On the 13F filing they released today, this position is nowhere to be found. 

**Does that mean Melvin covered!?**

#NO.

All this means is that they requested confidential treatment on all their put positions **AGAIN**.

You can see they did this with their previous filing, Melvin chose to redact [large put positions](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821000618/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) from their previous 13F filing by requesting confidential treatment on them.

Well the SEC denied their confidential treatment request, and they were forced to amend their 13F filing with these put positions NEARLY 2 MONTHS AFTER THE ORIGINAL FILING. All they did was kick the can down the road, and the SEC works about as fast as the DMV so it took them 2 months to deny their request. 

Now Melvin has done the exact same thing with this filing, they have simply redacted all their put positions from this 13F filing, requested confidential treatment from the SEC on all these positions, and will wait another 2 months before they finally have to amend them again.


From their previous filing, read the blue print:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821000618/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml

> "THIS FILING LISTS SECURITIES HOLDINGS REPORTED ON THE FORM 13F FILED ON FEBRUARY 16, 2021, PURSUANT TO A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT AND FOR WHICH CERTAIN HOLDINGS WERE VOLUNTARILY WITHDRAWN FROM THE CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUEST."

edit: **A lot of folks are saying put positions don't really matter. This is mostly true, however, on the flip-side there are a lot of apes who think Melvin may have closed their positions because of this - and the point of this post is to prove they didn't. Their puts very well could have expired, BUT it's certainly not a coincidence that ALL of their put positions mysteriously disappeared at the same time. I'm 90% certain they filed for confidential treatment again.**


TL;DR

MELVIN DID NOT COVER THEIR SHORTS. THEY ARE HIDING THEIR PUTS FROM THE PUBLIC.

BUY. HODL. VOTE.
