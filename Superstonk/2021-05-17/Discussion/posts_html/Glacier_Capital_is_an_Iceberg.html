<p>Alright folks. Someone probably already did this but if not, do I have a treat for you!</p>
<p>So I’ve never heard of this Glacier Capital and the set up for was real SUS. But SUS for another reason.</p>
<p><em>Drum roll</em></p>
<p>The majority owner of Glacier Capital is </p>
<p>SUSQUEHANNA CAPITOL GROUP</p>
<p>So that’s crazy right? One of the already sus players is now setting up their scapegoat.</p>
<p>Who has connections with Glacier and Sus?</p>
<p>The main boss Citadel. These turds are just dumb adds. Fodder snipe celly bros</p>
