<p>Did some number crunching while bored after work tonight.  Found something that is starting to show how the effects of evaporating liquidity are starting to show themselves.</p>
<p>Over the first four months of 2021, GME has not seen a single day-over-day close-to-close price movement of &gt;10% up or down on lower than 10 million volume.  It's now happened 3 times in the last 6 days.  </p>
