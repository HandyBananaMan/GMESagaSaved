<p>Lyrics</p>
<p>-----&gt; I don't like you, but I love you<br />
Seems that I'm always thinking of you<br />
Oh, oh, oh, you treat me badly<br />
I love you madly, you really got a HOLD  on me<br />
You really got a HOLD on me, <br />
you really got a HOLD  on me, <br />
you really got a HOLD , baby<br />
I don't want you, but I need you<br />
Don't want to kiss you, but I need you<br />
Oh, oh, oh, you do me wrong now<br />
My love is strong now you really got a HOLD on me<br />
You really got a hold on me, <br />
you really got a hold on me, <br />
you really got a hold, baby<br />
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me<br />
HOLD me, HOLD me, HOLD me  </p>
<p>Tighter<br />
Tighter<br />
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here<br />
Don't want to spend another day here<br />
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now, I can't quit now<br />
You really got a hold on me, you really got a hold on me, you really got a hold, baby<br />
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me, please<br />
