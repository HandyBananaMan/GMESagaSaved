# Winds of change - Scorpions

God it's good to be back, First of all I would like to thank the entire mod team for helping and keeping the sub in such amazing shape, I especially want to give a shoutout to [u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/) and [u/bye\_triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/bye_triangle/) for taking over the news.

It used to be that I wrote these alone each day, but from now on I'm looking forward with working together, this is why from now on you'll be seeing the title, then the writer and then the body of the text.

# What are market orders?

Written by [u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/)

I will not be going into what happened with Warden, for the simple reason I'm not entirely familiar with the situation nor do I care to get familiar with it, it happened let's move on and focus on the DD as we should, the DD is solid and that's all we need to know.Also there was some doubt as to how certain market orders worked and [u/jsmar18](https://www.reddit.com/u/jsmar18/) did an excellent write-up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ndg93z/dispelling_denouncing_wardens_fud_market_limit/) explaining different types of orders and

The post goes through several different orders, how the work and if you use them how they get executed, be sure to give it a look as it can give you some clarity on what orders do what.

# 140% SI?

Something that cought my eye was the image below

This opens up the possibility of the SI being off the charts, we thought that 140% was high (which it is IMO), but it also means that this is the max amount they can report, knowing now how they operate it's very likely they got greedy and said... Nah let's just not report the complete picture.

Because let's face it, if you could win millions why even worry about that 100k fine right? it's a cost of doing business for them, so who knows, what we do know is that no one got margin called in january (source: dtcc head honcho, third financial house hearing)

So.. who knows how high it even is right now, or what kind of advanced fuckery they have used.

# A note from your friendly local pink cat

written by [u/pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/pinkcatsonacid/)

First of all, thank you for all the meme entries in the Superstonk Daily Bananya Cat meme giveaway contest! Look for a winner post today from me announcing our winners and sharing the winning work of art!! ðŸš€ðŸš€

Now, Breaking News News

The mod team has been working nonstop to bring you a professionally respected, verified source of information in Superstonk. The kind that gets big names like we've had on for AMAs. And to expand on that, we are growing the Superstonk Daily format to allow for more Ape voices to be heard.

Starting tomorrow, you will see the Superstonk Daily DD, posted with its own custom, mod only flair, posted by automod at around 6:00 am NYSE time every weekday. (Noon for the Euroapes) We have devised this white-label automod system, which also serves to negate the "hero worship" that shills like to falsely accuse apes of as a way to discredit our news source.

Don't worry, you will still see our personalities shine through, and all articles will be properly attributed to their contributor (which we hope to include non-mod, community DDers, artists, and others in the near future!!) But this presents a more uniform presentation of the news as we continue to garner more attention and seek credibility. This isn't about awards or upvotes for a certain mod. It's not a popularity contest and we have all seen the damage that can be done if personalities get too big. We believe this adds to the trust this community has given us to be in this for the right reasons. ðŸ’ª

I'm so excited to see what this new format does for this community! It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve you all every day with [u/Bye\_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/) beside me while Rensole took a much needed rest. Now we're ready to kick some ass. And I'm absolutely JACKED to serve you as your Editor in Chief of the new and improved Superstonk Daily. âœŒ

Signed, [u/Pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pinkcatsonacid/)

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.

Also as far as I know the 13F filings are coming out today, so once we had the chance to review them I will be updating this post with either a link to an ape's thread or just the data!
