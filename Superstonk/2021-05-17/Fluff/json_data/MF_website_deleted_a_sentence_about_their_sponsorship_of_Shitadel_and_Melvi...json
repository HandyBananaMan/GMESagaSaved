    "selftext": "Good morning fellow apes,\n\nlast week I saw a post here about jobs at Motley Fool, stating that \"the company is sponsored by Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital.\"\n\nExpecting fuckery I saved that page with wayback machine, left the tabs open (besides all the 100 tabs already open lol) and checked this morning again.\n\nGuess what's missing..\n\nLink to the live-page: [https://www.theladders.com/company/fool-jobs](https://www.theladders.com/company/fool-jobs)\n\ncapture of May 14th: [http://web.archive.org/web/20210514071019/https://www.theladders.com/company/fool-jobs](http://web.archive.org/web/20210514071019/https://www.theladders.com/company/fool-jobs)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your day and I wish you a productive week besides checking GME-Charts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I found the thread again, where I saw the website in the comments: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbuis0/motley\\_fooled\\_or\\_conversely\\_how\\_to\\_lie\\_and\\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbuis0/motley_fooled_or_conversely_how_to_lie_and_get/)\n\nEdit2: Beware apes, this is not any kind of official information and it's not the official MF-website aswell. We don't know if it was edited by someone from theladders, MF-dudes themselves or if someone was able to edit it for trolling (as some comments suggested). So keep that in mind and take the information with a grain of salt. ",
