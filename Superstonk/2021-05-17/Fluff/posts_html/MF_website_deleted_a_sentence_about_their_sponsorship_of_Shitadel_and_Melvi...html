<p>Good morning fellow apes,</p>
<p>last week I saw a post here about jobs at Motley Fool, stating that "the company is sponsored by Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital."</p>
<p>Expecting fuckery I saved that page with wayback machine, left the tabs open (besides all the 100 tabs already open lol) and checked this morning again.</p>
<p>Guess what's missing..</p>

<p>Enjoy your day and I wish you a productive week besides checking GME-Charts!</p>

<p>Edit: I found the thread again, where I saw the website in the comments: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbuis0/motley_fooled_or_conversely_how_to_lie_and_get/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nbuis0/motley_fooled_or_conversely_how_to_lie_and_get/</a></p>
<p>Edit2: Beware apes, this is not any kind of official information and it's not the official MF-website aswell. We don't know if it was edited by someone from theladders, MF-dudes themselves or if someone was able to edit it for trolling (as some comments suggested). So keep that in mind and take the information with a grain of salt. </p>
