<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most of this shit is painful to read but here are a few snippets of how clueless or paid off these guys are:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ovcmsgba4rz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bfba072450fa829f8262d22119562de0fe59413">FUD attempt #1</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The classic, "<em>Even the CEO is leaving, it must be a failing business"</em> narrative.  Ryan-mother-fucking-Cohen. That is all.</p>
<p>Sherman can stay on the board after he steps down as CEO, I don't care and neither should you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Speaking about their very loose and purposely uninformed definition of <em>"Retail Investors":</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/bjtlfhca5rz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2494a2a98ec7aed30776e41961f71b45effb6d64">Wow, just wow.</a></p>
<p>If I were the likes of u/atobitt u/rensole or any other wrinkle brains, I'd go ahead and be offended.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More on them not knowing, or being paid to sound like an idiot, on Redditors:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/es1lps5d6rz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1995ab488631b0161cf5fad168c86e0bffd5c45">Glacier: Where we try and make shit up for personal gain.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Information isn't <em>"exchanged"</em> here, assholes. It's publicly placed for public viewing.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>More bullshit:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/4patwjuz6rz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7c7f6a820f6f44e39f84f70460f5dbdb91ec6d">Recruit new traders????????</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Actually we all just like the stock.  Only think I recruit is my wife to allow me to dig into more savings.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why stop being idiotic there, Glacier.  Give me more please, can you explain to me how a squeeze works?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/1mthbmzk7rz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65d0b3921eb5f039dd7c0e7b5b890aecdd34b586">Ummmmmmm</a></p>
<p>Actually all I know is fundamentals now.  Short interest, float percentage, institutional ownership, raw beta, OBV, VIX, MACD, yada yada yada.  Thanks for asking.  Anything else you want to teach me about a squeeze?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/qkdpl3cm8rz61.jpg?width=1137&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0c010f9a7fb8e9e5866799096367b4c05f1a150">Sheesh.....</a></p>
<p>Art? I fucking hate art. If I had an expensive piece I'd sell it for more moon tickets.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And Glacier, while you're at it, why don't you spit out some lies about GameStop the company as well, take it easy on retail investors:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/e8za6o849rz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1579f486c55ec779cf3e37dc38b9b469dc0d0c7f">BAHAHAHAHAHA</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm sorry, how much is the gaming/esports/e-commerce industry worth again?  How are stores being revamped again?  Glacier apparently missed the memo on Ryan's brick-and-mortar transformation.</p>
<p>"...<em>lost several key people".</em>  Yes.  And replaced them with an absolute <strong>DREAM TEAM</strong> of board members.  Somebody should update Glacier on what happened with Chewy.  Last I heard they beat some company called Amazon in the pet supply industry.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And lastly:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/xdd3oroj9rz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0231dc7e37b86640adee3d9fd56e3f92316d0486">I believe you're an idiot.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How about... (sentence continues below) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/58u8bfl1arz61.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e03341f08900b372846815d4ba3527dad94f0a">(Not from their Investor Letter Obviously)</a></p>
<p>.....REGULATING THE PEOPLE WHO MANIPULATE THE MARKET?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>Conclusion: Glacier is full of shit.  Probably supplying truckloads of Hellman's into Chicago.</p>
<p>Buy.  HODL.  Repeat.  Vote.</p>
