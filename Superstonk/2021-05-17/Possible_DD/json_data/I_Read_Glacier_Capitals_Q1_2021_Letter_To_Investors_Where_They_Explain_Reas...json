Ryan-mother-fucking-Cohen. That is all.\n\nSherman can stay on the board after he steps down as CEO, I don't care and neither should you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking about their very loose and purposely uninformed definition of *\"Retail Investors\":*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wow, just wow.](https://preview.redd.it/bjtlfhca5rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2494a2a98ec7aed30776e41961f71b45effb6d64)\n\nIf I were the likes of u/atobitt u/rensole or any other wrinkle brains, I'd go ahead and be offended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore on them not knowing, or being paid to sound like an idiot, on Redditors:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Glacier: Where we try and make shit up for personal gain.](https://preview.redd.it/es1lps5d6rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1995ab488631b0161cf5fad168c86e0bffd5c45)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInformation isn't *\"exchanged\"* here, assholes. It's publicly placed for public viewing.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore bullshit:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Recruit new traders????????](https://preview.redd.it/4patwjuz6rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb7c7f6a820f6f44e39f84f70460f5dbdb91ec6d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually we all just like the stock.  Only think I recruit is my wife to allow me to dig into more savings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy stop being idiotic there, Glacier.  Give me more please, can you explain to me how a squeeze works?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ummmmmmm](https://preview.redd.it/1mthbmzk7rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65d0b3921eb5f039dd7c0e7b5b890aecdd34b586)\n\nActually all I know is fundamentals now.  Short interest, float percentage, institutional ownership, raw beta, OBV, VIX, MACD, yada yada yada.  Thanks for asking.  Anything else you want to teach me about a squeeze?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sheesh.....](https://preview.redd.it/qkdpl3cm8rz61.jpg?width=1137&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0c010f9a7fb8e9e5866799096367b4c05f1a150)\n\nArt? I fucking hate art. If I had an expensive piece I'd sell it for more moon tickets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd Glacier, while you're at it, why don't you spit out some lies about GameStop the company as well, take it easy on retail investors:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BAHAHAHAHAHA](https://preview.redd.it/e8za6o849rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1579f486c55ec779cf3e37dc38b9b469dc0d0c7f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry, how much is the gaming/esports/e-commerce industry worth again?  How are stores being revamped again?  Glacier apparently missed the memo on Ryan's brick-and-mortar transformation.\n\n\"...*lost several key people\".*  Yes.  And replaced them with an absolute **DREAM TEAM** of board members.  Somebody should update Glacier on what happened with Chewy.  Last I heard they beat some company called Amazon in the pet supply industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I believe you're an idiot.](https://preview.redd.it/xdd3oroj9rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0231dc7e37b86640adee3d9fd56e3f92316d0486)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow about... (sentence continues below) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\(Not from their Investor Letter Obviously\\)](https://preview.redd.it/58u8bfl1arz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38e03341f08900b372846815d4ba3527dad94f0a)\n\n.....REGULATING THE PEOPLE WHO MANIPULATE THE MARKET?!?!?!?!\n\nConclusion: Glacier is full of shit.  Probably supplying truckloads of Hellman's into Chicago.\n\nBuy.  HODL.  Repeat.  Vote.",
