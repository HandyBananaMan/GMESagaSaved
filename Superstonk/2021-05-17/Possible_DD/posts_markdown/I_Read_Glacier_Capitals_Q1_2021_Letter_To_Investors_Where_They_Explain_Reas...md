[You're entering a world of pain, Glacier....](https://preview.redd.it/qn40diwq3rz61.jpg?width=868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d011c6d075b8d9e6fe61b6e51c7a0581124b8428)

&#x200B;

Most of this shit is painful to read but here are a few snippets of how clueless or paid off these guys are:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[FUD attempt #1](https://preview.redd.it/ovcmsgba4rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bfba072450fa829f8262d22119562de0fe59413)

&#x200B;

The classic, "*Even the CEO is leaving, it must be a failing business"* narrative.  Ryan-mother-fucking-Cohen. That is all.

Sherman can stay on the board after he steps down as CEO, I don't care and neither should you.

&#x200B;

Speaking about their very loose and purposely uninformed definition of *"Retail Investors":*

&#x200B;

[Wow, just wow.](https://preview.redd.it/bjtlfhca5rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2494a2a98ec7aed30776e41961f71b45effb6d64)

If I were the likes of u/atobitt u/rensole or any other wrinkle brains, I'd go ahead and be offended.

&#x200B;

More on them not knowing, or being paid to sound like an idiot, on Redditors:

&#x200B;

[Glacier: Where we try and make shit up for personal gain.](https://preview.redd.it/es1lps5d6rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1995ab488631b0161cf5fad168c86e0bffd5c45)

&#x200B;

Information isn't *"exchanged"* here, assholes. It's publicly placed for public viewing.  

&#x200B;

More bullshit:

&#x200B;

[Recruit new traders????????](https://preview.redd.it/4patwjuz6rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb7c7f6a820f6f44e39f84f70460f5dbdb91ec6d)

&#x200B;

Actually we all just like the stock.  Only think I recruit is my wife to allow me to dig into more savings.

&#x200B;

Why stop being idiotic there, Glacier.  Give me more please, can you explain to me how a squeeze works?

&#x200B;

[Ummmmmmm](https://preview.redd.it/1mthbmzk7rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65d0b3921eb5f039dd7c0e7b5b890aecdd34b586)

Actually all I know is fundamentals now.  Short interest, float percentage, institutional ownership, raw beta, OBV, VIX, MACD, yada yada yada.  Thanks for asking.  Anything else you want to teach me about a squeeze?

&#x200B;

[Sheesh.....](https://preview.redd.it/qkdpl3cm8rz61.jpg?width=1137&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0c010f9a7fb8e9e5866799096367b4c05f1a150)

Art? I fucking hate art. If I had an expensive piece I'd sell it for more moon tickets.

&#x200B;

And Glacier, while you're at it, why don't you spit out some lies about GameStop the company as well, take it easy on retail investors:

&#x200B;

[BAHAHAHAHAHA](https://preview.redd.it/e8za6o849rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1579f486c55ec779cf3e37dc38b9b469dc0d0c7f)

&#x200B;

I'm sorry, how much is the gaming/esports/e-commerce industry worth again?  How are stores being revamped again?  Glacier apparently missed the memo on Ryan's brick-and-mortar transformation.

"...*lost several key people".*  Yes.  And replaced them with an absolute **DREAM TEAM** of board members.  Somebody should update Glacier on what happened with Chewy.  Last I heard they beat some company called Amazon in the pet supply industry.

&#x200B;

And lastly:

&#x200B;

[I believe you're an idiot.](https://preview.redd.it/xdd3oroj9rz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0231dc7e37b86640adee3d9fd56e3f92316d0486)

&#x200B;

How about... (sentence continues below) 

&#x200B;

[\(Not from their Investor Letter Obviously\)](https://preview.redd.it/58u8bfl1arz61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38e03341f08900b372846815d4ba3527dad94f0a)

.....REGULATING THE PEOPLE WHO MANIPULATE THE MARKET?!?!?!?!

Conclusion: Glacier is full of shit.  Probably supplying truckloads of Hellman's into Chicago.

Buy.  HODL.  Repeat.  Vote.
