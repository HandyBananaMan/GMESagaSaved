The RRP transaction is used* ***less*** *often than a repo by the Fed, as a repo puts money into the banking system when it is short, whereas an RRP borrows money from the system when there is too much liquidity. The Fed conducts RRPs in order to maintain long-term monetary policy and ensure capital liquidity levels in the market.*\n\nSource: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverserepurchaseagreement.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverserepurchaseagreement.asp)\n\nA lot of people here seem to think that the fed is lending the hedgefunds money but this time its the other way around, the feds are the ones taking money and not lending it, but again seeing that it has a 0.0% award (no motivation for the others to participate) I believe they are \"parking\" money there because there is nothing out there that's a better spot.\n\nSeeing a lot of people (like big brain Dr. Michael Burrrrrry) believe there is a huge market crash coming, it may be one of the better places to park your money because even if the rest of the market goes bust, the government (fed) will still have most of your money, so the reverse repo could in theory be used as a hedge against a market crash.\n\n(or as I believe may be the problem, hedgefunds like Citadel going bust would cause a \"contagion\" effect once they go bust, resulting in an overall market crash)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[thanks to  u\\/Shiba\\_me\\_timbers ](https://preview.redd.it/btg538upql471.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c37a5ae0d163bcfee15ef33c6aa6b5ba8afbf9)\n\n# New fair value for the stonk\n\nMorning star has released their new \"fair value\" estimation for the stock.\n\nit currently sits at 315.98 usd per share, meaning that by todays estimates of the stock (current price is 231.80) is heavily underpriced.\n\nBut that dip yesterday... hmmm gme said they may offer 5 million more shares right ? and the float was 70.7 million shares\n\n**Addendum:**\n\nit seems that the ortex data picture was debunked so I've removed it, as we can not confirm this is indeed a share offering or not (the filing is worded in a way that they reserve the right to do so and this is very normal for any annual meeting docs, then we don't know if and when they will be offered) so the next segment will be crossed out as I no longer believe these parts to be correct\n\n~~Seems GME has added 3.57 million shares yesterday, meaning that today they can offer another 1.43 million shares, we get a massive dip and most likely see it rebound back to (at least) the minimum fair value.~~\n\nAnd I'm currently still going through the filings from the annual shareholder meeting, but this would give them over a billion dollars extra bringing up their cash in hand to almost two billion usd. they could use that money for an extremely big variety of reasons, they can buy other companies, they can expand in certain areas they're not currently in or even pay for a special dividend\n\nfiling that seems to be connected to this: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312521186802/d34311dex51.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312521186802/d34311dex51.htm)\n\nOne thing that I also believe that may be an option as of right now but is extremely tinfoilling hard.\n\nCurrently RC owns 12% and had a deal with the old board that he wouldn't buy more then 20%, perhaps with the new board in place his deal gets changed and he can buy more than the originally agreed 20%, or with the new share offering he can buy those and get up to the 20% mark and not be in breach of the contract.\n\nAgain that last part is pure speculation on my end and have nothing to back that up with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hnrxszksl471.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=dac32185118bf43ea270fe72c60424c5a2d004f0\n\nour in house exponential floor guy  u/JTH1 has been doing a chart for some time now and god damn it holds up...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7blmqibrsl471.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2637348278dd874bea3a6dc114c6effdca595577\n\nin his own words:\n\n**06/10 UPDATE: Broke the log-floor by \\~1% ( \\~5% in linear price scale ).

I don't know how to raise awareness about this other than commenting. I wrote you a message fering. The shares outstanding was 74.2718 but they recently restricted 2.436M shares which I presume to be for the CEO, CFO and Board members.  \nPer Prospectus \"The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding immediately after this offering is based on 71,815,131 shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 1, 2021, including 2,435,881 shares of restricted common stock which are subject to forfeiture or our right of repurchase as of such date.\"  \n\"Common stock to be outstanding: Up to 76,815,131 shares (as more fully described in the notes following this table), assuming sales of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock in this offering.\"  \nSource: sec.report and my bloomberg terminal. We won't know once the ATM offering is complete until they file with the SEC\n\nThank you guys for giving feedback so fast and making sure we keep the info accurate\n\nTeam work makes the dream work!
