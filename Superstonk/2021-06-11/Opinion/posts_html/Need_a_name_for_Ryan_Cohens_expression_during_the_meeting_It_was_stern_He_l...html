<p>Boner memes aside, this isn't a game or a joke for RC. He is Chairman of a company that is being targeted by predatory short selling and heavily manipulated by illegal market activity. He wasn't around Gamestop when the problem developed, but that doesn't mean he isn't pissed about it happening now. </p>
