(of a person or their manner) serious and unrelenting, especially in the assertion of authority and exercise of discipline.\n\nBoner memes aside, this isn't a game or a joke for RC. He is Chairman of a company that is being targeted by predatory short selling and heavily manipulated by illegal market activity. He wasn't around Gamestop when the problem developed, but that doesn't mean he isn't pissed about it happening now. \n\nUp until the meeting, what most of us saw of RC was smiling production photos taken of him post-Chewy success. The expression he had during the meeting reveals his actual attitude toward this situation. Serious, unrelenting discipline.\n\nBuckle up.",
