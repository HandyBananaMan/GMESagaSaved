Ranking day when the preliminary Reconstituion portfolio was ranked was back on May 7th.  At that time GME would have made the Russell 1000 cut by market cap.  The remaining Russell Index final announcements are today and next Friday.

I am thinking the Russel 2000 official announcement showing GME exiting the Russel 2000 will happen today, and the announcement adding GME to the Russell 1000 will be either today or next Friday.  All of the ETF underlying stock buying/selling will happen on Reconstition Day after market close June 25th, where between 3-5 times the daily trading volume gets traded.  Thatâ€™s one volatile trading day. Some wrinkle brains have commented on implications on GME already.  Buckle Up!!
