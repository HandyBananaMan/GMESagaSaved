I am an engineering ape, finance is not my background but I tried hard to understand this system well enough to make sense of u/atobitt 's Everything Short without being a total sheep.

I have seen a lot of posts and comments asking about what the RRP is and why it's important. And also a lot of supremely Jacqued Tits. I am jacked too, but I'd like to give back some more to the community and hope it helps.

I'm sure you have all heard that the Fed has been performing overnight reverse repurchase agreements to the tune of $500bn as of late, they're also known as ON RRP, or reverse repo's. I'd like to take a stab at ELIA. And also give some thoughts about what I think is happening - and who it benefits.

Here it goes:

\---

The Federal Reserve is the bank for the US banks. Their job is to make sure the US dollar remains valuable and the US economy works in such a way that it supports the dollar. Some will argue the nuance here. *That means* ***the primary goal is to keep long-term inflation down***\*.\*

&#x200B;

**The Fed has 2 tools to control inflation and keep the US dollar valuable: Federal Funds Rate (FFR) and Overnight Reverse Repurchase agreements (ON RRP).**

The FFR is the interest rate banks should lend to each other, and is set by the FOMC (essentially the Fed). This is the interest rate banks pay to each other to loan money to each other.

The ON RRP is when the Fed removes cash from the market in exchange for something else, in this case US Treasuries.

&#x200B;

**Why do banks loan money to each other anyway?**

They loan money overnight to help each other have enough liquidity to satisfy the fractional-reserve banking law. This law means you must have some percent of the money you hold in cash in an account with the Federal Reserve bank. The law states that you must satisfy an average amount of a 2-week average of overnight reserve. If you have a lot of clients that take money out of your bank today it can add up quick. In order to be a bank you must comply to regulations around fractional reserves, or how much money you keep in an account with the Fed. The Fed holds fractional reserve accounts for all banks in the US. Fractional reserves are the idea that if you have a bad day on the market, or something tragic happens you should be able to survive. *In the past, the US has been criticized for having too low of a reserve rate compared to more conservative banks, for instance the Bank of Canada.*

An example:

\- You receive $1bn from deposits on Monday

\- You lend 90% of that $1bn on Tuesday to a prime broker (usually a subsidiary of your bank - they lend that out to other people like hedge funds and so on)

\- On Wednesday your clients withdraw a net of $80million, but you only kept $100 million - so you now have $20 million dollars in cash. In order to comply to regulation you must find ($700 \* 10%) - $20 million. You must come up with $50 million dollars tonight so that you don't violate the law.

\- On Wednesday another bank had a net surplus of $100 million dollars, and they can't really make much money on it unless they re-invest it. We've got a deal! Other bank loans you $50 million dollars at a rate close to the Federal Funds Rate (FFR).

\- Other bank makes $50 million \* (FFR%), and you get to keep being a bank.

This happens every night, with every bank - they all have ebbs and flows of cash, and they all need to remain liquid such that when you go to an ATM you can actually take your cash out - and so that they don't get denied their bank status and go out of business.

&#x200B;

**How does the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) affect inflation?**

Supply and demand! If something is "hard to borrow" it effectively means there is less of it - it's the same thing with respect to lending, that's why it's referred to as the money "supply" not volume of dollars.

The lower FFR is the "easier to borrow" money is - meaning money worth less. When money is worth less, that means inflation is going up.

The higher the FFR is the "harder to borrow" money is - meaning money is worth more. When money is worth more, inflation is going down.

Prime rates, mortgages, car loans - virtually all lending rates depend on this supply / demand of money and therefore are all dependent on the FFR. That's why rates are sometimes described as (prime + x%) - because prime is what prime brokers will lend depending on the FFR. **During the pandemic the FFR was effectively 0%**. This allowed a lot of folks to get mortgages they may not actually be able to afford, in addition to some other really band lending that I will explain later.

&#x200B;

**How does the Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement (ON RRP) affect inflation?**

A similar relationship exists for the ON RRP.

The more cash in the market, the less cash is worth, inflation goes up.

The less cash in the market, the more cash is worth and inflation goes down.

The ON RRP allows the Fed to take cash out of the market. The ON RRP happens every night, and if it stays high - it's kind of like a permanent withdrawal of the funds from the market. Right now, essentially the Fed is taking out $500bn from the market. This is supposed to be "temporarily" until the market catches up with the cash flow. Critics of the ON RRP say that the Fed should limit it's use because it can negatively affect participants.

\- The Fed controls when to unwind the cash-flow and therefore can determine who is best positioned to take advantage of it when they do

\- The Fed becomes entangle with the free market operations, making them a giant crutch for private entities that will no longer adhere to capitalisms laws (too big to fail mentality). Private entities who are not afraid to fail will gamble and gamble **big.** *Sound familiar?*

**A phenomenon called "flight-to-quality"**

This phenomenon can occur with the Fed performing ON RRP because participants will prefer to do business with another entity of high quality. What makes an entity high quality? T

\- They give you good rates

\- They give you good collateral

\- They don't default with your cash on hand

When the Fed goes into the market as a large borrower of cash - they become the highest quality lender that one can find. They give great assets US Treasuries. They cannot default. The only thing is that they are giving shitty interest rates, but who cares. If banks are worried about short-term stability they are not thinking about interest rates, they are thinking:

\- How do I get out of this with out my money going down with another ship, i.e. without lending it to another bank because who knows what kind of shitty deals they made. Look at the ones I made! Holy fuck, Fed let me in!

\- How do I get enough assets to leverage for my own (nefarious) purposes. More below!

&#x200B;

Banks will choose to do dealings increasingly with the Fed, and less and less with each other. This is not a free market and it can have some very bad outcomes.

&#x200B;

**Why is the Fed using ON RRP aggressively now?**

They "printed" a lot, I'm talking 4 trillion dollars in 2020 - but obviously they didn't circulate it as currency. It's in the form of stimulus, forgiveness on loans etc.

Michael J. Burry warned us about a thing called *hyperinflation -* which just means inflation but very fast. When you double the assets that the Fed has taken on in 1 year, that would generally mean to me that if inflation were on the way, it will happen in a fucking hurry.

The Fed basically "printed" a shitload of money to keep the economy from crashing during the COVID-19 pandemic and in-so-doing created the blackhole of inflation we are witnessing them try to deal with now. The worst of it is, Dr. Burry predicted this ***before*** the pandemic, after it hit, it's not even a discussion, it will happen.

What we are seeing now is the whiplash of the COVID-19 printing spree being turned off - and it turns out there are 2 main components - and they compliment each other.

\- **The Fed is taking cash out of the market to prevent inflation** and prevent economic collapse, since all of the Fed operations are tied to mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities as well as the value of the US dollar - they have to act. There is no world today in which the US is prepared to have the USD not back most other currencies in the world. There is no world today the US can reasonably handle another collapse of the MBS or CMBS markets.

\- Banks (prime brokers) are taking US treasuries in exchange for their cash because they have too much cash and they over-lent to to participants with an extremely loose FFR. The extremely low rates would allow someone to leverage their assets incredibly high with very little interest or cost - this means 2x effectively cost the same as 20x for interest paid. Banks are now happy to accept US Treasuries on an ongoing basis to satisfy margin and other requirements for their participants to prevent them from being liquidated and taking huge losses.  *Remember that saying, "You lose $100, its your problem, you lose $100 million dollars it's your banks problem"*

&#x200B;

**Example**

\- You are a hedge fund, you get almost 0% borrowing fees from your prime broker on assets

\- You are also a cocky asshole who has great track record, so 20x leverage is no sweat since you never lose. You take this ultra low interest rate and pay essentially what you were paying before the pandemic but for say 5x the exposure.

\- You buy lots of blue chips (see later for more about this) and short the living shit out of some companies that are doomed to bankruptcy (that you've been in on this for years).

\- Your short play backfires - increases 10x

\- The COVID-19 borrow rates are gone and new rates on collateral are back to normal

\- You can't afford the new 20x leverage interest / fees

***- Your prime broker starts forking over collateral to you so that you don't get margin called and liquidated and lose all*** ***their*** ***money and your money***

\- Your prime broker uses the cash that the Fed printed and they now have to get the collateral to use for your shitty deal, they give you US Treasury bills which can be used at extreme leverage

\- US Treasury bills become extremely devalued, some other participants banked on that too

&#x200B;

**The  aftermath of COVID-19 monetary policy**

From Feb 2020 until now the Fed loosened monetary policy, lowered the FFR (inflation up!) and printed a lot of fucking money and in my opinion, banks and by extension their prime brokers over-lent to market participants in both the fixed income market (treasuries & MBS) and stonk market.  The Fed is now stuck doing permanent "temporary" ON RRP's until the market catches up to the money they printed, or a huge financial event happens.

US Treasury bonds are getting fucked up.

Banks are more evil than they have ever been.

Too big to fail is the attitude for all these bastards.

&#x200B;

**A run through of what the financial climate would look like and who would benefit (speculation last as usual)**

\- Banks (prime brokers) who are responsible for acting responsibly (ya right) with the loose monetary policy set forth by the Fed were supposed to use the Fed "printing" money as a security measure; they did not. The monetary policy was supposed to be used to support average workers and businesses that would otherwise struggle to pay bills or stay alive during the hardship.

\- Banks (prime brokers) in addition to using the loose monetary policy to provide help to average folks (they *did* and they *did* tout this all over) they used this rate to lend to hedge funds, other brokers, all borrowers.

\- The borrowers took this ultra cheap rate and decided to go fucking buck-wild on the markets since the cost to borrow was so low they could leverage even higher **with rehypothecation - the compounding borrowing fees would still be tiny; or nothing if the FFR was 0%** or almost 0%. Leverage your tits 9x, 10x, 20x doesn't cost any more so of course they'll do it. Bill "Big" Hwang was just one of the borrowers who got slammed as the monetary policy was tightening and the big players didn't want to take a huge hit. (There are other factors here, but this is basic principles).

\- Hedge funds and family funds in particular who have many special exemption from regulations took the opportunity to use the increased leverage in order to make big money. And I think they chose to do it **very strategically, through shorting smaller cap retail markets and business harmed significantly from a downturn like GameStop**, and through ownership of select consolidated "blue chip" big cap retail. i.e. scalping profit from the transition to online big cap retail with 0% interest paid

\- Hedge funds and family funds would love to consolidate as much of the US economy (mostly retail) into a few of the biggest entities in the market: *the ones that each of them already have huge stake in.* It's no secret that many institutional holders like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Citadel own huge disproportionate amount of huge cap monopolistic retail companies. Think about which business would be allowed to remain open? Who would know about this when the governments were deciding what to allow to remain open? Who would know about it before it happened? Not too hard if you're sometimes known as the 4th branch of government - and as we know the financial market is incestuous. They all talk, money talks.

\- Wal-mart, Costco, all the retailers who try to take business from local retail. **The biggest of them all got the biggest advantage of them all, Amazon - they never had to close at all.** The big players all had the same strategy, aggressively sell-short (even more!) those that were on the brink of survival before the pandemic, and pump the assets that are typically blue-chip or are positioned to take over the online retail spaces.

&#x200B;

This was the biggest pay day ever given by the Fed for free - and like usual the tax payer is on the hook.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - For the apes with shorter attention spans: Hedges are fucked. Banks are also fucked. Both of them are conspiring criminally to save their own asses. The Fed is complicit but probably not party.

**Buy and hold apes these assholes are NOT too big to fail this time.**
