Hey everyone,

so I stumbled over the above video where Tom Nash goes through a lawsuit that was filed against Apex Clearing Corporation in which Brokers (like WeBull) accuse Apex of forcing them to restrict buy orders for their customers due to lack of resources. However, Apex had the sufficient resources to meet collateral requirements set by the NSCC as per investigations from the lawsuit.

So when most people got mad at their brokers for not accepting buy orders but selling, this was most likely not the brokers decision.

This means, that removing buy options for customers over these brokers connected to Apex was most likely in Apex self-interest and that clearing houses like them actually play a bigger role in the manipulation than the brokers themselves.

So basically they wanted to save money by manipulating the market through brokers and their customers. It is just adding to the overall picture we are seeing over the last months on how greedy this whole garbage system is and how blatantly illegal they all act.

This is probably of little use for the weeks and months to come but maybe some of you find it informing.

**TL; DR:** Read the title and watch the video.
