[Shitadel sues SEC over its decision to approve a new mechanism for trading stocks at upstart exchange operator IEX Group Inc.](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN27201E)

**EDIT: UNLESS I'M READING THIS WRONG, CITADEL WAS PISSY PANTS THAT RETAIL WOULD HAVE MORE PROTECTION OVER UNFAVORABLE PRICE MOVES:**

**"The D-Limit is designed to give traders a way to buy or sell stocks at the exchange while protecting them against unfavorable price moves"**

It would be one thing if they made a stink for fair reasons if they were a MM that was totally on the level. But since evidence suggests they may not be - They not only made a stink, but did so in a hypocritical manner.

Really? Cry not fair when you're fucking the system?

If I was an oversight agency, I'd be motivated to look VERY closely at your fuckery.

This article may reveal a bit more but I'm into the brewskis and bananas and clearly don't possess enough wrinkles to figure this shit out so PLEASE! IF YOU HAVE WRINKLES share any insight this article brings.

Love you apes.
