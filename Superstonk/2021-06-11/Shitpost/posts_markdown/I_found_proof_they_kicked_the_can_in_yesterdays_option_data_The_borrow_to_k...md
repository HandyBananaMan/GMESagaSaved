I've been collecting option flow data for the past couple of months.

I've been anal-ysing yesterday's option data and i saw what looks like married puts and or can kicking. Upon closer inspection, i'm convinced they've kicked the can & created 1-2 million synthetics.

I'm writing the DD now in understandable format but it will take me some hours to get it done. I can't tell you how jacked i am right now.
