All morning Iâ€™ve been seeing hundreds of posts from apes saying how theyâ€™ve all bought the dip and added shares. This. Is. The. Fucking. Way. ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸ’Ž ðŸ™Œ 

If their tactic was to shake hodlers by causing a huge drop or creating FUD, on a Friday, when most people get paid, the opposite effect just happened. Apes are just increasing our positions, and itâ€™s beautiful.
