Thereâ€™s a lot of people reaching out to GameStop customer support just to get a reaction from them. GameStop customer support should solely be used for inquires for legitimate concerns regarding an order or question. 

I know itâ€™s fun to see what theyâ€™ll reply back, but cmon guys let them work on stuff thatâ€™s relevant to what theyâ€™re doing.
