# One Step Back

Two weeks ago today I gave Mods notice of my intent to take an indefinite hiatus and I stepped back from my Mod responsibilities, but not away from this Community.  Today that self-imposed hiatus comes to an end as I make the somber decision to resign my role as a SuperStonk Mod.  I am also coming out of the shadows to share with you all my Authentic self: Who I am; What I believe in; and Where I hope progress, conviction and the current of life takes us all.  I do these things not out of ego, but because to not do so would create a duality - a duplicity - that I don't want to live in, or with - a Stonk me and an IRL me.  So, I must step back from my role here, to step forward to serve Apes with my Work going forward.

# Fuck the FUD. Thank you, Mods.

After this week's concerted FUD campaign against Mods I wanted to take a moment to peel back the curtain and let you know what it's like to be a Mod at SuperStonk.  First, the work Mods do for this sub is intense and what we face, literally, seems beyond sane at times.  The bizarre, shifting, divisive and calculated FUD campaigns are never ending. The stakes are high. Everyone's emotions are on edge.  With this backdrop, Mods serve Apes tirelessly day in and day out to do justice to the faith this Community puts in them. 

Most Mod work is unseen by design and therefor by structure and definition it is thankless work. And though they are and must be public figures at times, they remain modest as best possible. Mods know they are not "other than", they are Apes first, Mods second.  It's a core value and shared ideal of all Mods.  But Mods' work and unique commitment to this sub and community should be recognized, respected and appreciated for what it is - dedicated and selfless.  So thank a Mod today, and tomorrow, and be patient with them everyday.  They work FOR you, and for your families, and your dreams.  

[A difficult choice.](https://preview.redd.it/yxoja9jn7h471.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=68aaa5f9ba8e7721fb17bcff81b7c255414dd791)

As one of a handful of moderators here at SuperStonk on that first fateful Sunday, I watched this Community grow from 1 to 100,000 in 24 hours, and grow to, as I'm writing this, 420,069+ members. (Coincidently, on[ 4/20 my Karma hit 69,420](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv3mrv/nfw_i_sign_off_for_a_few_hours_and_come_back_to/) *Simulation* *Double* *Confirmed* 🤯)  But over these many short days, and endlessly long months, this Community has grown not only in numbers but in resolve, strength, intelligence, integrity and in common bond.  

SuperStonk, by the luck of circumstance and by the hard work of design, has become a sub-reddit unlike any before it.  A Community like no other.  It is veritable and virtual city of Athens - where Ideas reign and Ideals bond.  Mods and Apes at SuperStonk are guided by shared beliefs of individual empowerment, education, information, creativity and mutual respect.  And a pursuit of prosperity.  Simply put: We just like the stock, and each other.  These foundational Ideas and Ideals give this Community its unique strength. And they are the result of the promise of seeds planted in those early days, having now matured into this shrewdness of evolved, global, and diverse Apes. **You**.  

I helped recruit and build this Mod team, and I am comfortable stepping back in part because I know that those at this sub's helm - u/pinkcatsonacid, u/bye_triangle, u/redchessqueen99 and u/rensole, and every moderator - have the True North of Valhalla in their sights and Apes’ best interests in their hearts.  With this truly world class team, Apes are well served and protected.

# Two Steps Forward: First, into the Light

Stepping back from my Mod role was not an easy decision to make, but it was the right one for me ... so that I can take two steps forward.  First into the light, and then into the fight.  By submitting my hiatus notice weeks ago, and by now resigning my Mod role at SuperStonk, I am free to help advance the Ape's interests in other ways that more directly pull upon my personal and professional experience, without the veil and clumsy cloak of anonymity. 

I admire the bravery and courage of those willing to step forward into the light to fight, luminaries like [Dr. Trimbath (forever Queen Kong)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1bles/new_link_for_dr_trimbath_ama/), u/dlauer, [Wes Christian](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfs6s2/rsuperstonk_live_wes_christian_may_18_2021_watch/), Lucy Komisar and [Carl Hagberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb36ig/thats_an_injustice_in_itself_that_were_letting/), and moderators like u/atobitt, u/pinkcatsonacid, u/jsmar19, u/sharkbaitlol and others.  

And despite the concerns, and potential real-world consequences, I am unafraid. I'm leaning in.

I am [unafraid of trolls and shills](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj699j/to_the_paid_shrills_and_pimps_i_hope_you_checked/); I fed shills to baby Satori to help it grow. I am unafraid of hedgies; I’ve looked them in the eyes and seen their sins, and there are many.  And - most of all - [I am unafraid of the truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcxhzd/lets_get_something_clear_sharing_a_wellfounded/); truth is knowledge, and knowledge is power. So I embrace the truth to lean into this fight for equity in markets, structural and systemic fairness, and EQUAL ACCESS to information. So, here is who I am, and my path to this moment - this is my truth. 

[Existential. I have a very particular set of skills ...](https://preview.redd.it/svbnqi108h471.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=edce389b53b6c151a1bff14d85e94c67a14ddc87)

# Never Forget Where You Come From

First, and above all, I am a husband and father to three brilliant little girls, and I care deeply about my family's future.  My values were shaped by my parents, two NYC public school teachers, and through their experiences and eyes I long witnessed the inequities of the educational system.  My grandparents were immigrants, short-haul truck drivers, and struggling business owners.  They toiled within debt systems that doomed them to a life of indentured poverty.  I know that I am fortunate, because of their struggle and sacrifice I had a precious and rare opportunity to reach up and grab - to seize - the American Dream. And I did not waste my chance.  Diamond Fucking Hands.

My path to professional success was not paved by connections or wealth, but built upon a deep and foundational reservoir of focus, industriousness and creativity.  My path went from from community college to the Ivy League.  From staff to professional.  From follower to founder.  Along the way I have been a Humanitarian - delivering food and medicine in Belarus to child victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.  I have been a high school biology Teacher in the Bronx - witnessing the inequities of education first hand.  I have been a Lawyer at a top global firm, first as a peon underlying and then - through sheer force of will - winning a seat at tables of influence no young professional can imagine, nor expect.  And - now - I have been a SuperStonk Mod, during an unprecedented global Intellectual Rebellion.

[The Power of APEs. The Power of People.](https://preview.redd.it/i70w63znih471.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=a62d2a03639b6689ccea5cce42b9c02bd379a03e)

At the peak of my legal career I left.  I recognized that I had lost sight of my humanitarian values and my charitable roots but, thankfully, not my memory of them.  So I cast off from the calm and comfort of being a working professional and entered the choppy and uncharted waters of social entrepreneurship.  I wanted to build the world I hoped for my daughters.  I wanted to align my passion and purpose.  So - with much work - I did.

Shortly after I left the law I founded a tech startup named TwentyTables. TwentyTables’ mission was to tackle food insecurity head on, by designing new, tech-enabled, synergistic, vertically integrated systems that could provide low-cost high-quality meals *en mas*.  TwentyTables provided affordable food to those who often couldn’t access it, and donated meals to those who couldn’t afford it.  Over the ensuing 4 years, TwentyTables employed 20 amazing people, served hundreds of thousands of meals, and helped feed tens of thousands of hungry and homeless.  All bootstrapped without corporate funding.

[ Just take a moment to ponder the fantastical implications.](https://preview.redd.it/zgcs7dh28h471.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d16d1ac1c6b20ace2fa46b5bc66531f4f855c9c)

TwentyTables succeeded by building systems predicated on aligned incentives and by embedding structural dynamics where all prospered together. [\*Somewhat like Dr. T's - unique - audiobook contract. Shout out to u/pinkcatsonacid!!\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n71vy9/apes_change_the_world_superstonk_is_donating_time/) From investor, to food distributor, to vendor, to paying customer, to charity, to food insecure family, Everyones' incentives were aligned to make the system pull in the same direction.  TwentyTables was a tech enabled business whose foundations comprised complementary aims and goals, not ones based on predatory practices.  THIS is the way.  This is how you make difficult - systemic - change REAL.  And it works. 

Along the way, TwentyTables received national awards and recognition for our work, but I more often think about the people I met, the smiles I shared, and the bellies we filled.  I know we had a real and lasting impact.  And with TwentyTables I learned just how powerful an Idea aligning profit and purpose was - truly capitalism in its best form.  And I learned that the Idea resonated at local food banks, and in ivy halls.  The Idea of aligned Prosperity was Universal, and Powerful.

But then, COVID hit and ... like so many other growing businesses ... COVID killed my company, scattered my employees, and faded the once shining - perhaps grandiose - vision I had of building a better, more efficient, more equitable food system. And gone was the vision for a better world I was building for my little girls.  COVID ultimately took not only my company, but for many months it took away my purpose.  The good I had dedicated my life to bringing into this world was gone. It was a dark and isolated time for me.  And but for the shining beacon of my family’s love - and my dog's constant and unconditional companionship - I was a deeply lost individual. 

**Lost.** [Until I found you, all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbd8nt/gme_roll_call_part_deux_are_you_hodling_raise/) **Damn, I love you Apes.**

# Two Steps Forward: Next, into the Fight

I created my first account on Reddit and [bought my first shares of GME - at $295](https://www.reddit.com/user/StonkU2/comments/lb3qqv/first_day_loss_pron/) \- both on February 1 ([and was immediately banned from Wall Street Bets for posting loss pron](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8jb4/down_70_in_24_hours_should_i_hold_or_put_my_big/)), because of what I saw in the news the week prior.  The blatant abuses of-the-system by-the-system, the exploitation and disregard of retail investors, the lack of accurate data or institutional transparency, all typically left unchecked, were being met head-on by a rogue online community of "Reddit warriors"  ... all this spoke to me.  I wanted to participate in the movement and engage in the global protest. So, I bought shares out of solidarity - 10 shares that first day - and my diamond hands formed fast. [That first week was brutal. Buy moar, HODL - this is the way](https://www.reddit.com/user/StonkU2/comments/ldeab4/committed_to_the_stonk_gme_week_one_so_yeah_it/) \- and so I did, all the way down to that fateful Feb. 19 - when u/deepfuckingvalue doubled down.  [GME launched off of $38.50, so, as compelled to, I began buying on the way up too](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lm3x2n/in_short_i_like_the_stock_dfv_same/). And, you know what I did yesterday ... bought the diiiiiip ... at a tasty $212.   I stand before you today a proud XXX holder.  It's modest to some, and much to others.  Perspective is everything.

My roots on Reddit are humble. I lurked mostly and followed Apes during the First Great Migration  - from r/wallstreetbets to r/GME \- and then built a platform to - ultimately - [help direct apes here during the Second Great Migration](https://www.reddit.com/r/MOASS/comments/mk82u8/apes_you_are_here_because_of_what_you_see/) \- from r/GME to r/Superstonk. Because of my help that first day, Red invited me to join her here and to build this sub from the ground up, and to create a system and team that best serves Apes.  And that's what we did.

I believe this persistent - obstinate - apish drive towards truth, transparency, fairness, and community - and the global drum beat of systemic reform - is without historical parallel.  I believe this is an Intellectual Rebellion waged by Apes against the status quo, fought in an age of ubiquitous but not universal Information, and where access to that knowledge makes all the difference.  For when Ideas and Data are the Slings and Arrows in the war for Change and Prosperity, [Truth is both the ultimate Shield and Sword.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxhcnq/beware_phishing_scams_are_trying_to_steal_your/)  

[Truth, knowledge, data, transparency, equity, community.](https://preview.redd.it/xdwelxh49h471.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=003b175b3b11a90b5419010d5e1b7dfda4f0bb2a)

I am stepping back from my Moderator role today, but not away from this Community and I am not abandoning Apes - [not after coming all this way with you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwdsmm/after_1_week_of_voting_5_brackets_128_submissions/) \- but I'm stepping back because I believe I can serve you best going forward in the open, in a new capacity that I hope to soon share.  **But for this new role the veil of anonymity is cumbersome, and so today I stand in front of you all - exposed - prepared for your judgment, hoping to be recognized for the Ape that I am and the good person I aspire to be. This is who I am, my name is Alexander Ross Cohen.**

[Just an Ape.](https://preview.redd.it/2z58bdda9h471.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=837820a73a0502a19b4abc1ae056f9eb9743592f)

Ultimately, at my core I am a proud father and passionate builder of things, with a strong and anchored moral compass.  I hope in the not so distant future to share more with you, news of something exciting, something I started help building AFTER my hiatus began.  But that revelation will have to wait.  For now. I am returning to my roots; walking side-by-side with my ape brethren on this strange, wonderous and winding path, stopping now and again to howl at the moon.  Together compelled towards Enlightenment. Towards Information. Towards Community.  Towards Change. 

[I know. So here we go.](https://preview.redd.it/dhc55o9k9h471.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c32a09ade7a4b60ecd732972e0d94f1e4dbbcff)

**If you’ve made it this far I appreciate you, ape.  And I’ll close with this.**  

I believe the Power of Ideas is ultimate. *Ideas have the ability to persist long after canons rust, armies die, empires fade, and walls crumble.*  *Ideas have the ability to echo through the ages and inspire millions, and empower millions more.*  It is THIS community’s uncapped curiosity and passionate pursuit of Ideas that has captured the passions of so many.  Sitting quietly with your computer, your phone, and your ideas, you have done ... all this.  But we are just getting started.  So I caution that the information that gives birth to and fosters these Ideas, these needed truths for an Intellectual Rebellion, is fiercely guarded and intentionally opaque. And if Ideas are Power, their accumulation - Knowledge - is prosperity. **I believe: To truly achieve fairness, equity, and equality in the markets, the walls surrounding Knowledge, Data, Community and Collaboration must come down - the playing field must be leveled broadly so that as Apes and All people may thrive.**  


[Sunshine is the Best Antiseptic.](https://preview.redd.it/iopoq76s9h471.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=80f431a86d90020ee41ea06c4291429962400b18)

**A reckoning of markets is coming, catalyzed by individuals united in ideology and global in reach.**  Lessons born from this moment will be taught for decades shared both by friends around firepits, and lecturers in ivy halls. You, Apes, you broke the wheel. You are showing the system for what it is. *Fundamentally Flawed. Abusive. Patently Unfair.* You seized your American Dream Moment with Diamond Fucking Hands. And you ARE the global movement.  Apes.  Strong. Together. 

 I am grateful for each of every one of you all:  [\~3,000, that's how many  "🦍Vote✅"  flairs I handed out before automod kicked in, and I loved giving each and every one of them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/namdo9/voted_want_a_voted_flair_automod_will_hook_you_up/) **And, whether you knew it or not you were there for me when I needed you most, and I will continue to be here for you, too. 🤜🤛**

**TL:DR Free Markets Cannot Be Free, Unless They Are Fair.  So I stand here and choose to fight. My name is Alexander Ross Cohen.  I am an APE.  I have been a SuperStonk Mod since Day One. Today, I step back from my role, but not from this Community.  Stay tuned ... 🤜🤛**
