    "selftext": "It's unclear the April List (https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories) on their website reflects the changes from their announcement yesterday, but I went ahead and compared that with the 2020 end of year list. I actually think the changes announced yesterday are NOT in effect, but I'm doing this anyways to see what happened between December 2020 and April 2021.\n\n**Here are the unique members who were on the list in December but are no longer on it:**\n\nName | Number\n---|---\nCSS, LLC | 670\nBNYMELLON/RE DBTCA/DB AG LDN PB CHEYNE VALUE FUND LP|2079\nBNYMELLON/RE DBTCA/DB AG LDN PB MULTI SEG CLEARANCE|2156\nBNYMELLON/RE RABO CAPITAL SERVICES|2677\nBNYMELLON/RE DBLPB-DBX RISK ARBITAGE 8 FUND|2719\nBNYMELLON/RE DBLPB-CENTAURUS PROXIMA FD\t|2724\nFIDUCIE DESJARDINS INC./DESJARDINS TRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT/CDS|4702\nTRUIST BANK/BRANCH BANKING AND TRUST COMPANY|5385\n\n\n**Here is the list of members who were not on in December that are now on the list:**\n\nName | Number\n---|---\nTORONTO-DOMINION BANK (THE)/TDGF MARGIN ACCOUNT/CDS|4714\nBMO NESBITT BURNS INC./BMO NB EQUITY FINANCE BMO UK BRANCH/CDS|4706\nVOLANT SECURITIES, LLC|4305\nMUFG SECURITIES EMEA PLC|4191\nBNYMELLON/DEDICATED PARTICIPANT #90|2886\nBNYMELLON/EPO II (B) SPECIAL HOLDINGS LTD|2881\nBNYMELLON/ECRE MAIN CAYMAN HOLDINGS LTD|2873\nBNYMELLON/BANCO SANTANDER S A|2869\nBNYMELLON/EXODUSPOINT CAPITAL|2866\nMARSCO INVESTMENT CORPORATION/STOCK LOAN CONDUIT ACCOUNT|2862\nDEUTSCHE BANK AG, NEW YORK BRANCH/CC O CLT TRI PARTY|2863\nJPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A./ABCP CONDUITS|2845\nBNYMELLON/DE SHAW US L CAP C ALP EX PORT LLC|2833\nJUMP TRADING LLC|2793\n\nHaven't done any digging into the new companies but if any other apes want to chime in that'd be great.\n\nEditing as I find information:\n\n**Edit 1: Jump Trading LLC** \n\nThey have been around since 1999.
