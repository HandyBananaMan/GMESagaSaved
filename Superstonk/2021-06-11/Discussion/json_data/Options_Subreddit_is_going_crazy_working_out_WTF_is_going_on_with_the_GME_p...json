If the shorts covered in January how is this still happening? Are they hiding their short positions with deep in the money puts? Is that possible?\" answered in our numerous DDs\n\n\\- \" Funny thing is when the media down plays the seriousness of GameStop and then you see someone drop 90mill on puts. If this was just some penny meme stock, there would be no completely public searchable information showing how hard shitadel and others have been manipulating the hell out the value. Yet fraud news agencies are not investigating. I feel like \u201cthe news\u201d used to do detective work, journalism... for the people. Now they lie and harm people. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- drop may be due to shorters closing their positions (300k shares) from earlier in the week\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \" If you're at the same time a hedge fund and a market maker, you can play options by shuffling money on the books to \"force\" your MM arm to make plays to stay delta neutral and get the desired price movements. Normally that would be incredibly expensive and not realistic, but if you're just shifting pretend monetary obligations between two wings of the same company, it's effectively free. Welcome to your free and fair market.\n\nEdit: If you want a market maker to use his legal ability to naked short what might you do? Force him to sell to stay delta neutral? Oh neat what would you do? Buy a shit ton of itm puts so he's \"forced\" to sell a shit ton of shares naked as he is \"required\" to do to stay delta neutral? Oh shit that would be super expensive..... Unless you're a hedge fund AND a market maker.\" No idea who this could be referring to....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Hedgies are running out of options (literally) to cover themselves. As usual there is NOTHING from the mainstream media to report on this. \n\nResearch is solid, jet is fuelling. **Buckle the fuck up fellow apes!**",
