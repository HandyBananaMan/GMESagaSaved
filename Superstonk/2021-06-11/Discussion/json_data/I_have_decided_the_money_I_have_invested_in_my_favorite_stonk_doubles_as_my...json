But Holy Fuck Nuts this community of individuals, of Apes, Ants, Euroapes, Apes all over the earth(we shall all be interplanetary soon enough)coming together and sharing information, guidance, laughs, pics and videos(some of which apes may or may not want to see \ud83d\ude02), tears, the ups and downs of both GME and life, it is just really amazing and I am both inspired and thankful to be a part of it. If this group could continue this and grow now and long after the MOASS I feel like this enormous mass of positive energy could accomplish what ever we choose to tackle. Shit, put millions or billions of dollars in our bank accounts and we are fucking unstoppable. Way OTM LEAP Calls on SUPERSTONK. I\u2019m so fucking ZEN if I just think about all my money in GME as money to help and support others through helping and being a part of this sub it\u2019s \ud83d\udcb4 \ud83d\udcb0 WELL SPENT.",
