    "selftext": "With the amount of attention EW guy is getting, it's looking mighty  familiar in pixels territory.\n\nNot gonna lie, when it hit the low, I also said, \"holy shit he called it\", but we have to stay diligent and it could or couldn't happen. it would be nice to see that 400+ price but nothing matters until we see that 20m.\n\nWe've come a long way, we can still wait. We went from:\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\nto\nBUY, HOLD, VOTE\nto\nBUCKLE UP!\n\nGlad to be part of this since Jan peak. Shout outs to mods, Satori crew, DD makers and Knights of New. Cheers!\n\nedit: if EW does hit 5/5 numbers, we all better drink a dam glass of water! or drink of choice...\n\nedit 2: not bashing pixel or EW guys. Everyone's entitled to do their own DD and projections. I'm talking about the train of hype we easily fall into and sometimes forget the basics.\n*buy, hold, everything will unfold.*\n\nedit 3: final edit before I go dark for work. reading through the comments, I'm reminded that pixels hype was in March. That time is VASTLY different than ape's resolve now. If EW is wrong, I'm 1000% sure apes won't go \"ape\" like we would've in March. So this post really isn't necessary. Nothing to see here. Have a great weekend.",
