<p>It's unclear the April List (https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories) on their website reflects the changes from their announcement yesterday, but I went ahead and compared that with the 2020 end of year list. I actually think the changes announced yesterday are NOT in effect, but I'm doing this anyways to see what happened between December 2020 and April 2021.</p>

<p>Haven't done any digging into the new companies but if any other apes want to chime in that'd be great.</p>
<p>Editing as I find information:</p>
<p><strong>Edit 1: Jump Trading LLC</strong> </p>
<p>They have been around since 1999. They have been subpoenaed before regarding their trading strategies as well as <strong>special arrangements they have with exchanges and dark pools</strong></p>
<p>https://www.ft.com/content/e03a199a-c5b3-11e3-97e4-00144feabdc0#axzz2zXM9acGv</p>
<p>In May 2018, they were fine $250,000 by the SEC for accidentally accumulating a short position worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Here is some basic info on them: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_Trading</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2: Volant Securities/Volant Liquidity LLC:</strong> They are small, but their main arm, Volant Trading with Volant liquidity is much larger.</p>
<p>https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_150063.pdf</p>
<p>IN 2017,without admitting or denying the findings, the firm consented to the sanctions and to the entry of findings that it failed to transmit to the order audit trail system (OATS) <strong>365,528 reportable order events (a 100 PERCENT VIOLATION RATE).</strong></p>
<p>In 2016, Failed to quote: (1) Continuous, two-sided markets in at least 99% of the options series listed on the exchange in at least 60% of its assigned options series for at least 90% of the trading day... $20,000 fine</p>
<p>In 2016, Volant incorrectly reported the trade time for numerous transactions to the exchange, and submitted numerous incorrect trade times to the exchange when reporting the subject transactions - Censure as punishment</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3: MUFG Securities</strong> Connections to many Panama Papers entities - don't know enough about this to do a deeper dive https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/80039478</p>
<p><strong>Edit 4: Banco Santander</strong> How is Santander, with €3.9 ($4.72) TRILLION IN ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY, and €2.1 ($2.54) TRILLION ASSETS UNDER ADMIN, able to stay hidden on the DTCC member list. Why would they want to?</p>
