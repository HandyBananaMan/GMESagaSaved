<p>There’s a lot of people reaching out to GameStop customer support just to get a reaction from them. GameStop customer support should solely be used for inquires for legitimate concerns regarding an order or question. </p>
<p>I know it’s fun to see what they’ll reply back, but cmon guys let them work on stuff that’s relevant to what they’re doing.</p>
