<p>Yes, the max pain for the 9'th was even higher at $351 but we never saw $351 as a GME price.</p>

<p><strong>Max Pain:</strong> $238</p>
<p><strong>Min-Max Prices for that day:</strong> ($261 AH Low) $211 - $287</p>

<p>Wow. Massive drop from one day to the next in Max Pain.</p>
<p><strong>i WoNdEr WhAt HaPpEnEd ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>What happened</h1>
<p>Intra-Day Max Pain and options happened <strong>( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/lcg5z32rol471.png?width=1143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4fe589adb794d5a7b04040a4e39df36343415a3">( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</a></p>
<p>Since you might be too smoothbrained to understand this, i'll do my best to explain it to you like you're an ape. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>
<p><strong>Puts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6000 put contracts purchased DEEP ITM at the $400 stroike for over 60 MILLION Dollers ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</li>
<li>4200 put contracts purchased at the $230 ish strike for around $20 MILLION Dollers ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</li>
<li>5000 put contracts purchased at 12:00 PM. All in the same minute. Multi-Leg Trade</li>
<li>4000 put contracts purchased at 12:35 ish PM. All in the same minute. Multi-Leg Trade.</li>
<li>The majority of these puts are dated to expire in 2-3 months and a few in 6 months (January Vibes)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calls</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Batch 1 of  3000 call contracts purchased at the $400c strike</li>
<li>Batch 2 of 3000 call contracts purchased at the $400c strike.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here's a cool caveat. The hedgie/MM that did these orders did the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy 5000 Puts at $230 and $400 at around 12:00 PM</li>
<li>Proceeds do a massive multi-leg order at 12:35 ish on both sides (hedge) for 3000 put contracts and another 3000 call contracts at the same time. I smell a hedge or <strong>married puts</strong> ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ) look at the timestamps ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ) ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)</li>
<li>Does another 3000 put and 3000 call multi-leg purchase at 12:45 ish again. Again, hedge or <strong>married puts</strong>? ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ) ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Look at the charts above and you tell me. I smell can kicking in this bitch. I smell a repeat of the $180-$280 runup but this time it's gonna run to $380 at the end of this FTD reset cycle.</p>
<p>Incidentally, i'll make a followup post when i can be bothered to anal-yze when the next FTD cycle bleeds are going to happen. The one cycle that i do know 100% that will happen is next week 16'th +-1 day depending on how they're going to handle it.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that this is NOT the ATM offering we're seeing. This is hegges being prick dicks.</p>
<p>They heard RC wants to do an ATM offering, so they artificially dropped the price using married putts to "Foil His Plans". Lmao they're stupid as shit. THIS was RC's plan all along and the honey trap RC and the SEC has set up.</p>
<p>The hedges just took the bait yesterday. They. Are. Fucked. The SEC now has a perfect trail. Give it some time ( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ)</p>
<p><em>Also they're clowns. I bought the dip yesterday for another xxx shares ( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ) thank you hegges.</em></p>

Imagine holding GME, seeing this and instead of going \"Wow\" you go complain about the quality of the DD ( ͡ಥ ͜ʖ ͡ಥ). It's pizza Friday ya'll.</a></p>
