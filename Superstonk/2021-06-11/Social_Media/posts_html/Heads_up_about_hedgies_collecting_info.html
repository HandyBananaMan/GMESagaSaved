<p>So there’s a couple videos on Twitter asking us if we want to join a group to support each other and all they’re asking for is your name, email address, brokerage firm, services offered etc. </p>
<p>Do not give your info to anyone. This is one way for them to recognize us as an official group and try to regulate what we can buy and sell. </p>
<p>It’s shady af and I don’t trust it. Neither should you.</p>
