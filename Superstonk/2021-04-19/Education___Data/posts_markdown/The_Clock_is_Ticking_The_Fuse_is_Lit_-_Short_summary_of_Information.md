FYI - I wrote this for some friends of mine that are too lazy to look into GME so I kept it as such - it is just a short compilation of facts and info, If you see anything I've wrote that is incorrect leave a comment I will happily edit. üíéüëêü¶çüîúüåöüçå

I am super fucking bullish on a GME squeeze AND the fundamentals, there is an ungodly amount of information that would indicate this happening and I believe it‚Äôs going to be an unprecedented event. Far too much information and rabbit holes to go down in order to properly explain.. here are some bullet points (and other thoughts) not meant to convince but rather peak interests to look into for yourself

**Why was GME a target for such shorting & GME debt settlement**

&#x200B;

* Massive Brick and Mortar retailer with failing efforts to pivot (It was suspected that GME had bad actors within the BOD with vested interest in GME failing)
* GME Raised 400+ mil in bonds, shorts never planed to cover but instead bet the house that GME would default on these bonds and ultimately go bankrupt (in that case shorts wouldn‚Äôt be required to pay taxes on those gains) Bond repayment date was March 15th 2021, GME paid roughly half of that off and extended the terms to settle the remaining debt in 2023
* Long ago 4-6month it became evident there was no chance GME could go tits up
* Last quarter earnings revealed 500+ million cash on hand
* Last week they announced the settlement of remaining senior notes approx. 240mil ahead of schedule (A middle finger to the shorts and also a requirement in order to issue a Divided or to make potential acquisitions - rumours of a possible acquisition of Super League Gaming and push heavily into massive industry of E-sports)

**New leadership**

&#x200B;

* Ryan Cohen a young Canadian Billionaire and founder of Chewy to become Chairman has been assembling a world class BOD consisting of mostly Ex Amazon and Chewy execs
* Cohen exited Chewy for 3.3bilzanos, bought 9 million shares of GME though his venture firm
* Cohen has essential booted the boomers and replaced them with many of his former team
* Note: Cohen paid roughly 78 mil for his shares in the company, in Jan his shares were valued over a bil

**Changes happening very fast**

&#x200B;

* closing down non-profitable retail locations and beefing up the others even adding an ‚Äúapple like" state of the art training centre ‚Äî if you guys don‚Äôt know how massive e-sports is and how much growth this industry is going to see then wtf
* Partnered with Doordash and started using retail locations as distribution hubs enabling orders to arrive in under 2 hours!
* Vastly expanded online product offering
* over 3000 open job positions
* capitalizing on the squeeze (NR stated the approval to sell up to 3.5mil shares to raise a maximum of 1 billion, using the words ‚Äúcan sell shares from time to time‚Äù They know a squeeze is coming and there are going to take full advantage)
* No Debt 250+ million in the bank
* Cult like following
* Cannot fail
* Tits Jacked

**Additional Confirmation**

&#x200B;

* Jimmy Cocaine crammer going nuts on GME investors
* Gary mother fucking Big Dick Gensler - implemented the Dodd Frank Act., Wall st. hates him was voted in as head of SEC over the weekend.. In the history of reg heads being voted in over the weekend in a rushed fashion in most cases was due to impending crisis
* MSM has put GME on a media blackout only reporting articles when it drops in price and flipping positive NRs into complete lies
* 100% bull runs, media goes unnoticed, then run rampant on a 20 point dip
* 5 or more prominent media source are owned by one parent company
* In Feb a massive dip on GME occurred with multiple articles released well in advance. (they even predicted how many points Gamestop would drop‚Ä¶ Being wrong they edited there headlines lol)!
* Obviously media is working with short hedge funds
* All the while GME is seeing one of the greatest fundamental turn arounds with bullish news coming out on the daily, the sp has been bouncing around but any drops are on insanely low volume (avg vol 30 plus mil we‚Äôve had multiple sub 10 mil days with massive dips on those days indicating they are not sell offs)
* Shorts continue to borrow and pump synthetic shares into the market
* Low tradable float, 4-5x buy to sell ratio on a daily basis, yet shorts seem to have unlimited shares.. Digging a deeper hole trying to keep the price from rocketing by issuing synthetic shares (one tactic)
* There are whales on the long side that are believed to be controlling the price and bleeding the shorts (max pain theory - possible)
* Short interest has fallen? It‚Äôs been proven that short HF are hiding shorts with deep Itm options
* SEC and DTCC/Regulators are fucking corrupt cucks, however the hole is getting so deep SEC, DTC, NSCC and FICC are now implementing new rulings that essentially allow them to request SLD, (Secondary liquidity deposit) - funds have one hour to satisfy requirement if they can‚Äôt. They get Margin called - Super dumb short form of the rule (this is ONE of many very very bullish for the Squeeze rulings underway)
* Shorts are trading through dark pools, routing BUY orders off regular exchanges so the orders do not affect the price and then dumping the sell orders on market hammering the price down
* Shorting ETF‚Äôs that contain GME, also to hide true short interest
* Millions of Failure to delivers - shorts are abusing or flat out using illegal methods to ‚Äúrest‚Äù the timer. (t+13 to deliver these shares in some cases longer but if they cannot locate shares which the can‚Äôt.. Using a method through deep money options make it appear they can satisfy and deliver the shares owed, allow them to rest the FTD timer..)
* Gamestop themselves have identified there may be a short interest that exceeds that exceeds the float (you can read this in there 10F)
* Ryan cohen hints to squeeze on Twitter
* An unheard of Negative beta above -20 at one point (in most cases stock have neutral betas so stocks usually move with the border market up or down).. A negative beta is the inverse as i.e SPY goes down GME goes up and vice versa
* Deep Fucking value doubled down a few months ago after he appeared in the congressional hearing regarding JAN 28th, he exercised his options last Friday 50k more share and then bought an additional 50k shares

**Everything is connected (tinfoil hat but maybe not)**

I won't attempt make any connection but I have read enough to believe there is, so these are just random points of interest

&#x200B;

* Michael Burry had a position in GME, identifying the high short interest long ago, to my knowledge he closed his position
* He left clues on twitter that indicate deep fuckery through Treasury bonds, very similar to what was seen on 08 with but with Mortgage backed securities (There is a very good DD on this which I can point you too if interested)
* Shortly after his twitter was deleted (and he mentioned being visited by the SEC before this)
* He also changed his twitter name to Cassandra.. Googled it and this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 1 : a daughter of Priam endowed with the gift of prophecy but fated never to be believed. 2 : one that predicts misfortune or disaster.
* He also posted this tweet - LOOK AT THE DATE

\- GME aside for now, major movements in the market in the past few weeks

‚ÄúMajor banks face billions of dollars in losses from their exposure to Archegos. Both Credit Suisse (CS) and Nomura tumbled Monday after warning of significant hits to their earnings‚Äù

&#x200B;

* Last week we saw Bank of America sell 15 billion in bonds (biggest single bond sale in history), JP Morgan 13 billion in bonds and Goldman over 5billion, Citigroup exiting 13 international consumer banking markets - Pulling this much liquidity out of the market all at once. Hmmmm.. (Tinfoil hat is on here chilllll)
* Anyways if i‚Äôm all wrong re: the squeeze, whatever, the fundamentals are Bullfuckingish, I think its a win win

**One last side point as to why the corrupt regulatory bodies now appear to be doing their jobs**

\-there is ALOT of attention on Gamestop at a global level and interested parties paying attention to all this know how deep the fuck stick goes inside the anal canals of the short hedge funds and the illegal practices they've been running. Shorting a stock has infinite risk there is no ceiling, hedge funds alone won't have nearly enough capital to cover the losses when they are margin called and currently the DTCC which acts a clearing house for brokerages and massive funds would be on the hook once these HF default and run out of capital. While the DTCC has an insurance policy in the Trillions it likely will result in the FED firing up the printer to bail them out when they to default. The rulings they're about to enact are to protect themselves: the SEC, NSCC, FICC‚Ä¶I have barely touched on the actual workings of these rulings. The reactions from regulators speak volumes, this whole cluster fuck is much bigger than GME.

**Last last point**

&#x200B;

* Citadel the main cuck (they process 48% of percent of all retail trades and make up most of Robinhoods rev) the dirtiest piece of shit CEO Ken butt bead Griffin worth 18 bil is under serious heat, well, he‚Äôs been hiring up ex regulators from various regulatory domains, likely to try and delay/suppress his mess.. Not a single post on any social platform perfectly timed with GME mini squeeze in Jan, they were quite active before this.

Bored of writing at this point but there really is a metric fuck ton of information on top of these sprinkles.  To end this, as these rulings start taking effect it will restrict the use of illegal/grey area shorting practices, it's happening quickly, the clock is ticking, the fuse is lit‚Ä¶

Buy it!
