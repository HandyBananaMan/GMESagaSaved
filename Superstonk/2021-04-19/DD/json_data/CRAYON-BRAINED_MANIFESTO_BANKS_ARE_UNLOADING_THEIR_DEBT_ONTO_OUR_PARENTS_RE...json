A passively managed account [explained by investopedia here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/what-difference-between-passive-and-active-portfolio-management.asp) means the bank or institution will invest your savings \"according to a strategy\" instead of you having full control:\n\n>An *actively* managed investment fund has an individual portfolio\u00a0manager,  co-managers, or a team of managers all making investment decisions for  the fund. The success of the fund depends on in-depth research, market  forecasting, and the expertise of the management team.  \n>  \n>A ***passive strategy*** does not have a management team making investment decisions and can be structured as an exchange-traded fund (ETF), a mutual fund, or a [unit investment trust](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uit.asp).  \n>  \n>Index funds are branded as passively managed rather than unmanaged because each has a portfolio manager who is in charge of replicating the index.\n\nPassive strategies are not \"actively managed\" for best results, but people trust that big banks have the smartest minds managing portfolios, and \"[fiduciary obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp)\" will require them to use those minds to act in my best interests, right??\n\n[from investopedia](https://preview.redd.it/tf1suw87x3u61.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a1674346ccf4f28c990086841be008d38df1f3c)\n\nWell, over the past 4 months of intense brain wrinkling, I learned that many brilliant minds think that a market crash is unavoidable in the near future.

(I posted that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mt6fiq/psa_call_your_parents_and_ask_them_if_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).)  My experience was unsettling- I learned that their retirement savings were in passively managed accounts through large institutions.  My mom had chosen how \"risky\" she wanted her investments to be- she chose a 50/50 plan, she said- and let the institution allocate accordingly.\n\nTurns out her investments are in 60% stocks, **40% bonds.**  My dad has even more in bonds than that.  I realize that this is a very common investment strategy for retirement funds, and in most markets provides a dependable, unchanging amount of money back-per-investment.\n\nDependable, unless you're concerned about a market crash, inflation, and [major dilution of the bonds market.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/flood-of-new-debt-tests-bond-market-11615372201)\n\n# BONDS WILL NOT PROTECT INVESTMENTS AGAINST INFLATION.

Youtube: [Mohamed El-Erain explains Buffet's hatred of bonds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ue4Cds8tVg) in his last shareholder's letter.\n\nI then learned that my *husband's* parents employ an independent financial advisor to \"actively manage\" their retirement funds, paid on commission based on their fund's performance.  That advisor had moved his parents' funds *almost entirely out of bonds,* ***and started doing so over four years ago.***  Neither of his parents work any more- they're entirely dependent on that money for the rest of their lives- it's not something they would take any risks with.  Knowing that, their advisor *still* made this move *and* went so far as to give his parents a book, [\"Be an Owner, Not a Loaner\"](https://prezi.com/nwnd3jgtqff5/be-an-owner-not-a-loaner/), explaining the difference between how bonds and stocks would retain value based on current market conditions.\n\nYet here were *my* parents, having chosen low levels of risk, having their money being invested in ***40%+ in bonds.***\n\nIf you check out [J.P. Morgan's retirement guide here,](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/retirement-insights/guide-to-retirement/) they actually recommend a portfolio of **60% bonds** if you have \"medium-term goals\" like college or home loans.\n\n[JP's retirement strat](https://preview.redd.it/fjqxcegux3u61.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f256d57d7ed8260a5d863a99bcd1d3662ca9b1)\n\n[Goldman Sach's retirement guide](https://www.gsam.com/content/dam/gsam/pdfs/us/en/fund-literature/brochure/brochure-model-portfolio.pdf?sa=n&rd=n) is similar, explaining that the lowest-risk portfolios are those with the most money into bonds.\n\n[\\\\\"Fixed income\\\\\" means bonds allocation](https://preview.redd.it/0q8igmowx3u61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=204955e93627074386c5bba37871c8dc16e70ce6)\n\nSo.... according to the sacks at Sachs, my husband's retired parents have their money in the \"highest risk\" portfolio possible.  Which doesn't make sense based on everything I know and have linked above, *especially* if there's a debt bubble about to burst, and one good catalyst could trigger it.\n\nThen I happen to see this news posted: [**3 big banks hold largest bond sales ever this week.**](https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441)  Bank of america sold $15 billion worth, JP Morgan sold $13 billion worth, and Goldman Sachs sold $6 billion.
