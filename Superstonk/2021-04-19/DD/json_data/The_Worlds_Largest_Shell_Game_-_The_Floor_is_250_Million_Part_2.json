Well, this is a skim of what a parent company can be or do **(or take)** from their own. And technically one could say Company X is bankrupt or insolvent, but everything from securities to funds are simply moved up the latter and we pretend losing a lower rung means really anything.\n\n  > Termination Rights\n\n > The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for MSG Entertainment and MSG Networks, including, without limitation, if the Merger is not consummated on or before December 20, 2021 (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d).

Well what are they borrowing?\n\nInvestment category says...\n\n> *agency debentures and agency strip  *\n\nWow way to not use capitals in a sec filings, that's just lazy. So what is this?\n\n > Agencies\" is a term used to describe two types of bonds: (1) bonds issued or guaranteed by U.S. federal government agencies; and (2) bonds issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)\u2014corporations created by Congress to foster a public purpose, such as affordable housing.\n\n > Some organizations issue no-coupon discount notes\u2014called \"discos\"\u2014generally to help them meet short-term financing demands. This explains why disco maturities are usually quite short, ranging from a single day to a year. Discos resemble STRIPS in that they are zero-coupon securities that are issued at a discount to par.\n\n > What Are Interest Only Strips? Sometimes investment firms or dealers take a debt obligation or pool of obligations\u2014mortgages, Treasury bonds, or other bonds\u2014and after separating their principal and interest portions, sell them as distinct security products to investors, thus creating what's known as a strip bond. An interest only strip is one of these separated securities\u2014the part that consists only of the interest portion of the monthly payments.\n\n> Although interest only strips can be created out of any debt-backed security that generates periodic payments, the term is usually associated with mortgage-backed securities (MBS).\n\nSo they're borrowing these out to a lot of big names. \n\n[Advisors Inner Circle Fund] (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000878719/000175272421065808/xslFormNPORT-P_X01/primary_doc.xml) (remember III is the Chevy Chase trust fund) has a net worth of 1 trillion dollars. They are doing [commodities contracts.](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/commodity-contract-work-15796.html)\n\n > Commodities such as grains, basic food products, metals and energy products trade through standardized contracts called futures contracts. A commodity futures contract is for the future delivery of a specified amount of a commodity. Commodity contracts are used by buyers and sellers of the commodities to lock in future delivery price and by traders looking to profit from commodity price changes.\n\n**Futures Brokers**\n\n > Commodity futures are bought and sold through an account with a commodity futures broker. Commodity brokers must be registered with the National Futures Association and are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The commodity futures brokerage business tends to be separate from the stock brokerage business with most commodity brokers specializing in futures trading. A commodity futures broker will provide a new account holder with trading software and either live or online recorded training about trading futures and types of strategies.\n\n**Finances of Commodity Futures**\n\n > To trade a commodity futures contract, the the trader must put up a margin deposit for each contract traded. Each commodity has a fixed margin deposit amount set by the commodity exchanges. At the time of publication, the initial margin deposit for one corn futures contract is $2,363 and the maintenance margin is $1,750. The value of futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each day. If an individual had a new corn futures position and the value increased by $800 during the day, the $800 profit would be swept into the trader's unused cash balance. If the contract lost the $800, the margin deposit would have dropped to $2,363 minus $800 or $1,563. An additional $187 would have to be added to the margin deposit to bring it up to the maintenance margin level of $1,750.\n\nBut they're not the only ones.

The servicing activities described above are currently provided by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. (formerly known as PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc.)  The name PNCGIS is used herein for ease of reference.\n\nWooaaah, 22.3 trillion? That's a lot, thank goodness Mellon merged with Bank of New York in 2007.  \n\n > In addition to buying and selling securities as a broker and principal, BNY Mellon is engaged in asset servicing through its offering of global custody, global fund services, securities lending, global liquidation services and credit-related services to institutional clients (e.g., mutual funds, public retirement funds, etc.).  BNY Mellon provides such services to over $22.3 trillion in assets under custody or administration, making it one of the leading asset services providers in the world.\n\n Wait wait wait what's that number? Man how do I get to be custodian of that much money? Oh, not quite as impressive as 22 trillion... Wait it absolutely is.\n\n> BNY Mellon acts as custodian for more than $450 billion in assets for onshore and offshore fund managers.  BNY Mellon also provides collateral management solutions to dealers and investors around the globe for a range of financial transactions, including repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending, and derivatives transactions.\n\nJP Morgan Chase Bank is the Primary Custodian.

To date, ASA has been unable to determine under what circumstances DTC would place a chill on (or lift a chill from) a security.  Without complete certainty as to whether DTC will place a chill on (or lift a chill from) a security, ASA believes that CLS is not a reliable means for ASA to purchase securities on the TSX.\n\nSomeone got salty as fuck in the footnotes. \n\n\n> The Commission adopted Rule 3a-7 in recognition of the increasing importance of ABS Transactions in the financial markets based on the recommendation of the Division of Investment Management (the \"Division\") in its 1992 report, Protecting Investors:  A Half Century of Investment Company Regulation (the \"1992 Report\").9 Prior to the adoption of Rule 3a-7, Issuers fell within the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a) of the Act and, absent qualifying for exceptions from the Act under Section 3(c)(5) or obtaining exemptive orders from the Commission, were subject to a regulatory regime under which they could not operate. In adopting Rule 3a-7, the Commission stated that it intended to \"remove an unnecessary barrier to the use and development of structured financings.\"10\nUnder Rule 3a-7, an Issuer that meets certain conditions is deemed not to be an investment company under Section 3(a) of the Act. \n\nWell well, what is this? \n\n> Consolidation within the financial industry that occurred throughout the 1990's and into the 2000's as a result of bank mergers and sales and related acquisitions of trustee services businesses by banks has resulted in a significant decrease in recent years in the number of bank trustees providing services to Issuers. For example, during 2013, five bank trustees acted for 89% of approximately $215 billion in new U.S. ABS.15 The Applicant acted for approximately 25% of all new U.S. ABS in 2013. By contrast, in 1990, the top five bank trustees acted for 35% of the approximately $46 billion of publicly-offered new ABS.16\n\nWait. Wait wait wait.\n\n> The Commission noted when it proposed Rule 3a-7 in 1992 that the Independent Trustee Requirement \"would not depart from industry practice,\" because \"virtually all trustees are unaffiliated with the other parties involved in\" an ABS Transaction.14 The absence of trustee affiliations was primarily due to the limitations imposed on permissible bank activities at the time. Due to: (a) consolidation of the banking industry (and corporate trustees in particular), (b) economic and other business factors and (c) the expansion of banks into investment banking, including the underwriting of securities issued by Issuers, most trustees that provide services to Issuers, including the Applicant, have affiliations with underwriters to Issuers. As a result, when, as is frequently the case, an affiliate of Applicant is selected to underwrite ABS in an ABS Transaction, Rule 3a-7(a)(4)(i) generally prevents the Applicant from serving as trustee for the Issuer.\n\nAnd then ofc a written lack of liability.\n\n> Unlike a trustee for a corporate or municipal debt security that may need to pursue discretionary remedies against the issuer in the event of a default, a trustee for an Issuer has no operating entity to pursue for such remedies. The default risk for an Issuer is solely related to risks that arise from the composition and performance of the assets in the asset pool or the insolvency of the servicer or credit enhancer.\n\nTrustees can be granted quite a bit of power if a company folds.\n\n > When liquidation is mandated by the Transaction Documents and circumstances of the transaction, the trustee will preserve the assets of the Issuer, using the available cash flow to make payments, disseminate information to investors and may be subject to the \"prudent person\" standard. If a servicer of the assets defaults by failing to perform its obligations or due to its insolvency or bankruptcy, the trustee may have the legal obligation to perform the obligations of the servicer until another servicer is selected.\n\nAnother nod to Citigroup, who's been in some trouble lately.\n\n> Citigroup Inc. (\u201cCitigroup\u201d or \u201cCiti\u201d), the parent company of the Settling Firm, CGMI and the other Adviser Applicants, is a global financial holding company whose businesses provide a broad range of financial services. The Settling Firm is a financial services holding company and the direct parent company of Citibank. CGMI, a New York corporation and an Affiliated Person of the Settling Firm, is a full service investment banking firm. CGMI engages in securities underwriting, sales and trading, investment banking, financial advisory and investment research services. CGMI is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). CGMI currently does not perform Fund Service Activities (as defined below) for any Fund 1, but it may seek to do so in the future.\n\n\n\nI get it, so you're like they're all like that, right? Well, smaller companies with a dream and a need to raise capital, they have to file a lot of stuff to get an IPO to be able to offer stock, and THEN hope someone meets the minimum projected capital. Cause, look at [Brix Reit](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001723028/000114420419020703/tv519457_40app.htm) trying to raise funds for student housing. I like this company and they seem so much more transparent. And they're [struggling](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001723028/000172302821000003/brixreit-202102121uxmessag.htm)\n\nConsidering how many small businesses have filed Beneficial Ownership with big banks, what a shame these guys are struggling so much.\n\nYou know those Funds set aside for 'Advisors' and 'Managers' to avoid federal tax income (and state taxes), and to preserve capital? They have billions of dollars. What are they preserving capital FOR?\n\nI'm not going to list more parent companies or 40APP in this Part. Just know Morgan Stanley is not unique, and they're using small companies for their own growth.\n\nIt can be beneficial, SpaceX got their chance cause of North Holdings, which is controlled(basically) by Citadel, sure, but SpaceX is going to revolutionize how NASA makes their shit. So that's cool.\n\nBut what about the companies like Brix Reit struggling cause student housing took a huge hit? Oh right, they had to implement a Plan of Liquidity. Maybe they should know the right people, huh?\n\nI know it's disorganized. I didn't work in the finance side of legal, so I'm parsing a lot of new information.\n\nim sharing the search with you guys cause there HAS TO BE A BASE OF KNOWLEDGE to understand all these brilliant DDs that other people are writing.\n\nI can't teach worth shit but i can share links and thoughts. ill keep working on it tho my brain is dusty\n\nI think the next part will involve Citadel, they've been up to a lot with talking on small companies looking to have their own IPO. Citadels interest is definitely snatching up new dealers with unmarked cups.\n\nNEXT TIME",
