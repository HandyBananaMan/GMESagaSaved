Throughout the world, ongoing central bank liquidity has bolstered financial assets rather than goods and services that produce growth in the real economy.\u201d\n\n\nHE ENDED SAYING \u201cWITH SO MUCH LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET TODAY, THERE IS LITERALLY NO VALUE IN THE MARKET TODAY.\u201d  - Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of Blackrock (whom manages $9 trillion of assets worldwide and owns 13.2% of gme). \n\n\nEdit: Actual quote: \u201cThe flood into high quality assets, because liquidity is so large, there is literally no value in the markets today.\u201d \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: link - https://youtube.com/shorts/MeKMOrn7nEk?feature=share",
