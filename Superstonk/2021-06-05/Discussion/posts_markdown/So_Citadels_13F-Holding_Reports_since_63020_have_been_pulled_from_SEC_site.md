EDIT: Source of the problem was incorrect Information Table filenames for the last couple 13F-HR filings, leading to an error in the "search by text" engine when trying to reach them. Still, sus to me it happened on last 3(5 including amendments) 13F-HR filings.

I'm not sure if there has been a post on this or not, I know we have a lot of DD silverbacks here that know (A LOT) more than I about all this and could have already posted on this. If you do know this has already been answered, or you might have more information on this, please let me know!! That said, let's get to it.

I happened to be surfing the SEC database for Citadel filings, specifically I wanted to look at their recent 13G activity. 13G(13D) filings are notices of acquisition of beneficial ownership of a company(>5%). I noticed quite a bit of 13G acquisitions since December 2020 and wanted to actually dig into it, I am not an expert, I just learn a subject or process better by actually jumping in head first.... That's when I came across 13F-HR reports. I tell you, I was not ready for the tumultuous 6 hours of zoned in researching and tab-opening.....

![Lots. Lots of filings.](https://preview.redd.it/2aimul8g7i371.jpg?width=1422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8a18f71ea029f0b693b1d4aab33fe6ec096afc3)

I found out I couldn't see anything in the more recent 13f-HR filings past the Cover Pages. Nothing, like at all. That's when I had an idea, I started looking for specific holdings through filters. Doing that brought up the information tables (specific holdings in the filings). Clicking through random dates, I noticed the database could not find the specific information tables for the most recent 13F-HRs... just the cover pages for each. Weird, right?

![Missing everything but the cover pages, hmmm?](https://preview.redd.it/ph5xvk9w6i371.jpg?width=846&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01111d7de2188adcabd0e1061681e9a4d3816e76)

So how are we supposed to know this just isn't the SEC website messing up? Well, only the 13f-HRs filed after 8.14.20 seem to be missing the information tables.

"But what makes you so certain they were there in the first place" You might ask?

1. Filings before 8.14.20 (holdings before 6.30.20) are all accounted for
2. Database has the all the filings and cover pages, but is missing the actual information
3. A little site called  [Holdings Channel](https://www.holdingschannel.com/) has the **most recent** (3.31.21 \*filed on 5.17.21\*) GME holdings for Citadel....

![Weird, 3rd party site has info that was pulled from SEC database. ok.](https://preview.redd.it/szfj25fr9i371.jpg?width=820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48fba772c1e66377475c209a9692d3b86babca5f)

Super weird. Why on Earth would the SEC pull specific holdings info after it was posted? What has happened since 3.31.21 that could explain this or give a clue as to why it's missing?

Oh, just a few things (just including May) really:

1. 2 amendments to the 5.17 13f-HR were made, could have just been a simple mistake... except the SEC wouldn't pull a year's worth of 13f-HRs just for that, so it cant be this.
2. The infamous Gamestop Moon Tweet (What did they knooow??)

![Yeah, that was a good day.](https://preview.redd.it/t8b9g9y8ei371.jpg?width=240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45ef0835d344d4d0d36b3c5115696cce65090a73)

3. Oops \*moass\* my bad

![Another good day.](https://preview.redd.it/5ksqu7egei371.jpg?width=521&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2adfb9d68f5fa9ca8d7d57a953ee5af4697d0a6c)

6. and last but not least, G. Sachs and the trade data fiasco:  [(17) BREAKING: Goldman Sachs & Co fail to reconstruct AT LEAST 10% of computerized trade data between December 2nd 2020 and January 29th 2021 : Superstonk (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nqmz4u/breaking_goldman_sachs_co_fail_to_reconstruct_at/)

&#x200B;

Taking all of this in, you might think the G. Sachs trade data issue could have caused the SEC to pull every institution's 13f-HRs Information Tables containing the specifics.... well, that's not the case either. Other institution's 13f-HR filings seem to not have this issue, it's unique to Citadel. (checked a bunch of other institutions, but obviously not all) Side note: interesting enough, Melvin Capital's 13f-HR filings containing Gamestop only starts halfway through 2020,  only contained Puts, and all the Information Tables worked, so again, this is seeming to be unique to Citadel...

Now wtf could possibly explain this.... oh IDK maybe being investigated by the SEC? I cant seem to shake it, but I got electric chills thinking about it. I can only hope it's a sign that a certain lady is about to start calling....

![Yes. I was the crayon artist responsible for this.](https://preview.redd.it/px3u9latii371.jpg?width=608&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92df34b4f2e9ea722b23bee4e66e14101c8cc24b)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Citadel's 13F-HR filing information since 6.30.20 (filed on 8.14.20) containing their specific holdings and information on the SEC site, has all been pulled, minus the cover pages. 3rd party sites like [holdingschannel.com](https://holdingschannel.com) have the latest information, but not the SEC, leading me to believe Citadel is currently being investigated.

I hope you apes enjoyed the read, I worked hard on it. It's not much but it's something my slightly-wrinkled brain was able to look into a little bit.

Edit: fixed a date in tldr

Edit 2: Thanks to u/T_orch for spotting this. Seems the database itself is having trouble locating the Information Table files for the last couple filings for Citadel. For some reason the archived file for them are still reachable, but the database itself cant reach it. I don't know what this means, I just know some location error is throwing off the database. I didn't notice this error for other institutions for the same time period, so for some reason it is still unique to Citadel. Still jacks my tits trying to figure it out. Everything Citadel is sus now.

Edit 3: thanks u/humanslime for spotting the error. It definitely was just a pathway error due to inconsistencies in the Information Table file names, for the 13F-HR filings after 8.14.20. For some reason using their '/search through text engine' won't reach the information table files, when their /browse lists show all the files fine.
