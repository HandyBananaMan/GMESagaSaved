If you're hoping boredom is your winning strategy, you are completely fucked. At this point I don't even care about MOASS, I've been poor long enough and am comfortable with it. I just hope this never ends because this has been incredibly entertaining to watch play out.

0 chance you can make this "boring" enough for us to get us to sell shit.
