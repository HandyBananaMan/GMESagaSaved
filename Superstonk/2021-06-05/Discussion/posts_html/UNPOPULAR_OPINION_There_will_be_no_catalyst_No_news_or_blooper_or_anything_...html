<h1>Hey my beloved apettes and apes!</h1>
<p>Following you'll find a summary of a few key facts as I understand them, please review them and let me know if there's any misunderstanding on my side. Because I value your time I'll keep it as concise as I can. </p>
<ul>
<li>The float is sold out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwskkv/retail_easily_owns_100300_of_the_remaining_float/">multiple times</a> over, right?</li>
<li>GME ist <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?key=gme&amp;_page_id=4587&amp;cntry=usa&amp;tag=&amp;ib_entity=&amp;ln=&amp;asset=&amp;f=4587&amp;conf=am&amp;amref=1">hard to borrow</a>, right?</li>
<li>OTC-lit market HFT trading does nothing to the price because of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhtg1p/the_nbbo_best_price_is_only_determined_by_round/">NBBO</a>, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's very likely, that the only way for them to supress the price is to keep creating more predatory synthetic stock dilution. This cost them the required options to marry the puts and calls but as the resulting counterfeit shares are fake, it's not affecting the SI - who would they pay it to anyway? By using the cheapest available options for those counterfeits, the cost drain might also not be that massive compared to their liquidity. </p>
<p>So the main problem for them is to keep enough collateral - IF they are reporting the ammount of counterfeits correctly. But why should they? I'm sure they found loopholes there so they keep the true ammount of fake shares secret. </p>
<p>Assuming all that, what could any blooper, news or anything other than a forced buy-in do to make them cover the shorts? Nothing! Instead, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrjcpo/media_theorist_here_lets_talk_about_how_to_talk/">creating all this hype over a CNBC blooper can be very damaging to our cause</a> by driving awareness, clicks and revenue to MSM outlets and distract from our goal. Hence I implore you: STOP POSTING MSM CONTENT!! NOTHING THEY DO WILL AID US!!</p>
<p>Although there are signs that the hedgies are struggling more and more to keep lid on the kettle, we do not have any robust reason to believe the MOASS is going to start anytime soon - except it is forced. So what could force the big squeeze?</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/1pp8ln7qxf371.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a37eee3cb6991f489a0ced614e9470c1a09baff5">We like the stock</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Share recount</li>
<li>Initiative by the stock issuer themselves - RC could order it if possible.</li>
<li>Not sure if there is a legal way to force this. I really doubt it because hundreds of other firms would have tried something like that before they got liquidated after being shorted to death. </li>
<li>But maybe that's why every vote counts  - if the result exceeds the issued shares by enough, there might be a way.</li>
<li>NFT dividend</li>
<li>Initiative by the stock issuer themselves - RC could order it as soon as possible.</li>
<li>As this is a very nice mechanic and GameStop is uniquely good prepared with their NFT project, this might be the silver bullet. </li>
<li>Overstock paved the way legally.</li>
<li>DTC-005</li>
<li>Initiative by the clearing houses. DTCC is owned by the banks and hedgies they clear so they are not incentivised to be pro retail at all.</li>
<li>This would require them to mark lent shares, in theory making predatory synthetic stock dilution impossible. I mean, who would mark stocks improperly? </li>
<li>It might be that this is only for future shorts. In my opinion it's unlikely that they go after already existing fake shares with this because this would possibly blow up their FTD warehouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the most powerful trigger might be the dividend. Executing this might be complicate though, depending on how the digital currency works. Maybe some kind of account suffices, maybe there's a lot of additional work to do to couple it with international retail shareholders. </p>
<p>In any case, please do not fall for hype narratives that are not grounded on logic. It might be an angle to try to emotionally exhaust us - even though that didn't exactly work in the mast six months, did it? </p>
<p>So please, fellow apettes and apes, let me know: </p>
<ul>
<li>Where are my errors in reasoning? </li>
<li>Did I overlook any key facts?</li>
<li>Should we expand on some points?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL-DR:</strong> Please do not focus your hype on MSM smoke screens, keep your eyes on the target. Shorts won't cover until they are forced to and a NFT dividend could be the most powerful way to do so.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the awards and kind words! ðŸ¥°</p>
