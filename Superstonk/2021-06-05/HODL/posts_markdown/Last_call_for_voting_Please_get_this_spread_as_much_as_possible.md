Last call for voting is within the next couple of days. 

If you owned any GME shares (even 0.x or x) on April 15th, contact your broker and ask for your control number and voting instructions. 

Every vote matters.

Every ape matters. 

Add fuel to the rocket. 

Letâ€™s not fall at this late stage. 

TADR: if you bought and held, VOTE!
