**DFV came to a realization !**

Okay, so I think *i figured something out*. Hear me out here, this post contains a **lot of speculation** and you should treat my  worked out interpretation as a hypothesis. Importantly, I've got some wrinkles but none of which are specialized in the US stock market/finance. So please correct me if I make any wrongful assumptions along the way or if my reasoning is flawed for some reason.

**Update**: made some changes as to clarify some points, nuance some exaggerations and stress another point. So first of, this is an interpretation of a tweet and in *no way* a statement on what DFV should do, that is completely up to him of course! Secondly, apes are on a spectrum when it comes to altruism: some of us are really motivated to help others and make some changes, others just want a lot of tendies for themselves. Both is fine, this post is not meant to spark a discussion with regard to that. Apes should do with their money as they please, as long as they do not hurt others in the process, imo.

[DFV came to a realisation](https://preview.redd.it/669fhntgtg371.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e80b579f5287693f25f9a9d0d1c26aaad358af92)

**When I saw this** [**tweet**](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400124740291923968) **I went bananas. To me it appears that DFV is telling us: I will not join the race. Ergo, he will not be selling his shares during the MOASS. Which of course will have massive consequences since he will literally hold a tiny infinity pool. How big is this pool? About 200k shares, or maybe it's bigger...**

Why? Because this is not (anymore) about money, this is a moral battle between right and wrong. This sub has put amazing effort into exposing unethical stock market activity. And I believe DFV stand to loose nothing if he will not sell most of his shares. I'll explain that in a bit.

So first let me state my **theory**, I'll be using the Matrix installment as to simplify some things and just because it makes for an awesome comparison: Michael Burry is our *Morpheus*, DFV is our *Neo* and lets say RC is *Trinity*. I'll keep it short, don't worry. Take the January crash as one of the final scenes of the first matrix movie; Neo got shot down, resurrected because he now fully believed and understood he was in the matrix (a simulated reality) and could not die. The crash was a simulation, DFV stopped the 'bullets' (did not sell) by understanding this crash (death) was not real. He showed us and took away some of our final doubts during the congressional hearing, now apes could start believing again: understanding the simulation and not fearing death (stock price imploding) inspiring us and giving us the confidence to buy and hold (sure some were already transformed). Basically he bent the spoon for us to see (there is no decrease in value of the stock price, the price is not real just as the spoon is not). He became our immortal protector. In addition, informing us that he was not a cat, the guy is so *factual,* Love it. Note, this is not hero worshiping but merely meant as a fun comparison!

**Buying those dips!** Now this is very speculative, what if DFV is **helped** the whales to ensure the max pain levels by continuously buying dips. In doing so, only adding to the infinity pool (or puddle) he decided to create. Since the creation of such a pool implies absolute death for the short sellers. This might explain why DFV uploaded a final overview of his Yolo bet, not exposing his new amount of shares. As u/Spirited_Squash_1535 pointed out, DFV tweet about the 'president' on the phone saying 'he did it again' suggest he again doubled down. At this point where in the second matrix movie, Morpheus gives his epic speech, telling us were are still here (still holidng!) while Neo and Trinity are *making sweet love* upstairs in some sort of cave room (DFV & RC are loyal to the same cause). Why do I assume he might be creating an infinity pool/puddle, ergo not selling? Look at how that tweets ends, Parzival (?) (who represent DFV who is back again (i.e. active on twitter)) does not join the race after GME gains traction and we go all green.

Now for those of you who think you should include details of the rest of this movie; I'm not sure about that. I think you should look at the selected elements in the context of our battle and try to understand what is being communicated here. Just like the Austin Powers tweet also does not imply DFV is a unfrozen British spy or needs a penis pump; Fucking is his middle name (D**F**V), and he's gonna fuck over some hedgies big time, *yeah baby*!

[Don't EVER press the GME Sales button. ](https://preview.redd.it/3vz1xd924m371.jpg?width=1704&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eab345f4a42a275b0b939b0da279a24429872250)

I like to thank u/ [midway4669](https://www.reddit.com/user/midway4669/) for pointing out that the MIB tweet signals the same: ***don't ever*** press that red GME sales button. Excellent addition to this narrative! And note that 'ever' is emphasized in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400863669895024643) since it is the only moving word. 

Figure out for yourself how a creation of such a pool in this situation would almost certainly ensure all the apes **banking big time**. It inspires apes to hold strong, since a big part of the float can not be bought back as to cover shorts. Who of us is not going to reinvest part of the earned money back into GME, who of us is not going to be a life long loyal GME customer, who of us is not willing to donate part of his money to DFV? Point being: there is almost no financial risk for him to do so. Furthermore, like I said, this is a moral battle: for many of us it is not about the money but its about rebelling against these unfair practices. And yes, we get rich while doing so, let just call that karma. Plus, I believe DFV might work for GME in the future, as their technical annalist. With the Moass going down, all the media attention and the GameStop transformation that has been started our shares *currently* valued around an average of $200 \~ 250 will be worth way more in a few years. Thus, holding that infinity pool might not be risky at all but might be the most simple elegant 5D chess move one can make, since it will ensure the destruction of the Hedgies that over (naked) shorted GME and the stocks have *deep fucking value* to begin with.

[Agent Smith as metaphor for a out of control program harmful to the simulation. Smith naked shorting everybody for his own gains, hence the copies of him in the background ;p](https://preview.redd.it/cvi355o1vg371.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67f5ced456f046da58a36df1b5b872a43824f760)

This holding of the infinity pool compares to the final battle in the Matrix. The Matrix (AI) realizes that one of its programs (agent Smith) is out of control and a danger to the whole system. The Matrix being our society/economy/SEC, agent Smith being out of control Hedgies like Citadel, DFV as Neo our hero that dares to battle this program as to destroy it and fix the simulation (our economy/stock market/GME) for *all the other apes*. You, I, and our fellow apes represent the awaken humans joining the battle from Zion. That is to say we are aware of the simulation (the shorting & fuckery) as well and are part of *the force of the army of holders*.

========================================================================

Just some food for thought. If you do not agree with me, I really like to hear how you interpret the tweet. What does it mean according to you? One thing I'm **absolutely sure** about: these tweets are not random, are meant to inform us about the process and thus this one as well has a message. So why communicate "you have figured something out" followed by not participating in the race. Additionally, If DFV used his account as to create an infinity pool, it would make sense that he no longer updates his Yolo bet since that information is very important to the enemy.

So when I saw his tweet I went "Holy shit, he is going to 'sacrifice' his shares as to ensure the destruction of the hedgies". And think about it, I would do so to myself: a few millions is enough to enjoy life to the fullest. *nobody needs* to be a billionaire. But becoming a legend, fostering the progression of society/humanity, helping your fellow apes, gaining super hero status and ending up in the fucking history books is **priceless**. That's the real deep fucking value in my opinion, absolute changes of the markets as to achieve a more fair distribution of wealth and a better working of the economy. We know how harmful naked short practices can be, how it impairs progression, that is the real loss in my opinion.

**TL;DR:** What if DFV has become the infinity pool and will not sell during the Moass as to ensure the destruction of the evil Hedgies. Great strategic move with which we stand to gain a lot and imo not risk to loose anything.

Logged into Reddit for the first time on my laptop as to make this post. Needed to include those awesome pictures. Will add the obligatory rockets in a bit on my phone ;p.

Furthermore, for younger apes who do not know the Matrix movies. Go watch em, one of the best series of movies ever to have been created with a lot of philosophical messages.

I said it before: *life is* ***stranger*** *than* ***fiction***. You all have been experiencing this so far. But shit is about to get way more crazier, be ready for it and mentally prepare yourself for what is to come.

My final note, as to end things in style:

&#x200B;

[Know you are a Diamond Handed Badass on the Right side of history about to kick some hedgie ass. The experience of FUD is normal, everybody fails to first jump, even Neo. But by now you've been  hardened: you've seen enough spoons bending to be aware of the simulation. You know the value of your stocks. DFV, our hero, our savior. To the moon my friends](https://preview.redd.it/dcw64066wg371.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=171df7927963245ddaba7a3f41240c7e34924243)

==========================================================================

EDIT 1: Originally I also speculated on a potential capital injections so that DFV would have had more firepower. I recognize that this point was way to speculative and many apes point out that this is not necessary.  Furthermore, fellow apes found this unlikely and pointed out that it might be deemed to be insider trading. Thus being the great hive mind we are I decided to adjust this. Thanks to u/RelationshipPurple77!

EDIT 2: Try to fix most of the images so that they're shown.

EDIT 3: added the MIB tweet + some clarifications and adjusted edit 1 to be a bit more clear and not step on anybody toes. Originally I also referred to DFV as a whale, that of course also is an exaggeration. Let me call this beautiful bastard an Octopus, since those are one of the most intelligent sea creatures we know of.
