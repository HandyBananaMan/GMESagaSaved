<p>in summary, they're being forced to put 65 million in an account at the treasury department in order to pay out to investors harmed by their payment for order flow between July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: for all those complaining about 65 million being too low, there is a 30 day public comment period with details about it in the first link. if you're serious about your opinion and want to put your tendies where your mouth is, <strong>this is your opportunity to voice said opinion - take it seriously</strong>. given the changes we've seen in regulations &amp; personnel lately, the SEC <em>could</em> be pretty receptive to feedback.</p>
<p>i'll link them here to make it easy:</p>
