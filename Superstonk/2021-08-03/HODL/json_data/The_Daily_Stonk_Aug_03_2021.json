Eat a balanced meal and take your morning vitamins!\n\n\nIt is time for [The Daily Stonk](https://preview.redd.it/h5yz344z4qe71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=030ec1b2a90085e5a71eb5246f3edf714fd2e331)\n\n\n[Just a reminder we are in the S&P mid-cap 400 tomorrow!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owgnjd/oh_yea_gme_being_included_in_sp400_this_wednesday/)\nWhat does this mean? Well it means that we have a solid company that has true potential. So like our parents kept telling us: Find a good stock and hold onto it.\n\n\n[Reverse Repo is hanging out just under $1T still](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owjfqi/daily_reverse_repo_update_0802_921317b/) \nA bit of a daily tradition at this point. Although I'm not sure I truly grasp it\u2026. If anyone has some data on what this number really means please point me in the direction with an explanation like you're talking to [this fine man.](https://tenor.com/view/wumbo-spongebob-gif-10902129)\n\n\n[Call the market a balloon cause it is inflating baby](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owub83/inflation_alert_a_dive_into_the_bureau_of/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n/u/Dismal-Jellyfish does a great write up of what the % numbers are. This is why we don't dance. We have bet against the economy. It crashes it affects everyone. It goes in line with the ending of the moratorium. When these two things combinely pop people will lose a lot of value in 401k and property. It will be a tough time. That is why we need to step up and be the light. \n\n\n~~[Potential ETH address for dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ow880o/10k_more_just_transferred_through_the_ethereum/)\nNow this one is interesting. It seems that we are just a few thousand whole coins within this address for the amount to match a dividend for the proper shares at 0.0001 per share. This will be fun to watch and see. If this is what /u/clawesome thinks it is this will be where GameStop will shift to. This potentially is a catalyst.~~ [Debunked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ow880o/10k_more_just_transferred_through_the_ethereum/h7efbt4/)\n\n[Looks like we've got some indicators to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owe33g/sp_smallcap_to_midcap_shift_everything_you_need/)\nIf my smooth brain translates this correctly there will be some sideways trading on all of these little pools of stocks. They will come with a little bit of a dip if we hold to the principal of all good news comes with a dip. But again good company with strong fundamentals. Hold onto them like daddy said.\n\n\nPlease feel free to tag me in any verified information or any story that is developing! \n\n\nI am the furthest thing from a financial advisor. All this is just some bumpkin's opinion who's brain is as smooth as his head.\n\n\n[EXCELLENT!](https://giphy.com/gifs/ifc-80s-bill-and-ted-excellet-l46CDHTqbmnGZyxKo)\n\n\nusers worth noting:\nu/DeepFuckingValue (dont need to explain...)\nu/atobitt (DD)\nu/Criand (DD)\nu/pctracer (Reverse Repo Market Updater)\nu/JTH1 (Floor Guy Stonkdate)\nu/mr_boost (Ape News Network | Comedic posts)\n\n\nThank you to the mod team!!\n\n\nAs always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries. This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends. We help each other, we care for each other. Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes!\n\n\nRemember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.\n\n\nWe don't care, just be nice and let's make this community as Excellent as we can!\n\n\nOkay that is all for now burbye.",
