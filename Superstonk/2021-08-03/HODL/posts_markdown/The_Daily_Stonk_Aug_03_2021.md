What does this mean? Well it means that we have a solid company that has true potential. So like our parents kept telling us: Find a good stock and hold onto it.

A bit of a daily tradition at this point. Although I'm not sure I truly grasp itâ€¦. If anyone has some data on what this number really means please point me in the direction with an explanation like you're talking to [this fine man.](https://tenor.com/view/wumbo-spongebob-gif-10902129)

/u/Dismal-Jellyfish does a great write up of what the % numbers are. This is why we don't dance. We have bet against the economy. It crashes it affects everyone. It goes in line with the ending of the moratorium. When these two things combinely pop people will lose a lot of value in 401k and property. It will be a tough time. That is why we need to step up and be the light. 


~~[Potential ETH address for dividend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ow880o/10k_more_just_transferred_through_the_ethereum/)
Now this one is interesting. It seems that we are just a few thousand whole coins within this address for the amount to match a dividend for the proper shares at 0.0001 per share. This will be fun to watch and see. If this is what /u/clawesome thinks it is this will be where GameStop will shift to. This potentially is a catalyst.~~ [Debunked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ow880o/10k_more_just_transferred_through_the_ethereum/h7efbt4/)

If my smooth brain translates this correctly there will be some sideways trading on all of these little pools of stocks. They will come with a little bit of a dip if we hold to the principal of all good news comes with a dip. But again good company with strong fundamentals. Hold onto them like daddy said.


Please feel free to tag me in any verified information or any story that is developing! 


I am the furthest thing from a financial advisor. All this is just some bumpkin's opinion who's brain is as smooth as his head.

Remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals. BUY and HODL.
