<h1>Apes,</h1>

<h1>I think it's time for a pep talk.   I hit Zen a while back and I've not been as active as I was before.   I realize that it's been a while and this constant FUD that you can be exposed to can be overwhelming.  So, here is your "Pep Talk".</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you are new here or haven't heard me ramble, welcome!  Anyone else, knows I'm long winded Marine but I love this stock.  I'm 100% in on GME.   I bought most of my position back in the $250 range.  I bought my first share when it was in the 30's and bought a couple premarket at $480.   I've see GME run up 3 times.   I won't give away my position but I've seen more money in my account during the run ups....yet I didn't sell.  I'm 100% convinced that Apes are right and now it's seeing how the corrupt broken system will handle it.</p>
<h1>This is the DTCC, SEC, politicians, bankers, brokers, etc worse nightmare come true.  Apes figured out the the secret of their corrupt little games of naked short selling which was always overlooked and Apes are exposing the dirty rotten underbelly of the financial system to the masses.</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>The only thing that needs to be said at this point is SHORTS DID NOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS FROM YEARS OF FUCKERY.  They hid them in the options chains and are stuck.</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>The DTCC literally had to rewrite their own rules and Apes are literally forcing rules to possibly be enforced.  The longer this goes on the more evidence Apes have of the corruption.  They needed to close for losses back in Feb when it was $40 a share but they got greedy.   They thought retail would take it's losses and move on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Why am I convinced?</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>I've never seen a stock act like GME.   I've been trading a long time and I've never once seen a stock trade like GME.   Like never fucking ever.....</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Never have I seen a normal stock (non penny stock) have the buy side shutdown.....in plain sight of the world like back in Jan.  Then they couldn't get their acts together enough to lie effectively to congress</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Never have I seen a stock swing wildly on ZERO news.  I've seen GME run up and down like 50% in a day on ZERO news.  Most of the time, they at least pretend to cover their moves with a news article they feed their cronies, with GME, there isn't even an attempt anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>The millions of articles saying "It's over."  "Here are 5 stocks we like better than GameStop"  "Reasons GameStop is going down"  <strong><em>(Guess what:  You know who talks about things not being over 10 times a week for 7 months?  People who are trapped in bad positions who are desperate to close their positions)</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>They amount of time and effort they are using to spread FUD means they are stuck.  Listen, if they could easily close this positions for a sizable loss, they would have already just cut ties already.   <strong>Shorts are stuck.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The magic OTM Puts and ITM Calls that magically appeared the day the SI % dropped hugely.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Any good news is met with shorting and a ton of ITM Puts used to temporarily drive the price down.  On low volume (Because retail isn't selling), they are able to manipulate the price down.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>=================================================================================</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>****This is the my last and probably the most important part for new people.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1>The Price of GME does not matter.</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is probably the hardest part to understand.   You are watching your money go up and down.   At times GME is seriously down when HODLing.   It's gut wrenching......but it's part of the fuckery.   <strong>Guess what, GME's price is being manipulated.  (Gasp:  Shocking but true)</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you are a large and powerful Hedge Fund or Market Maker and now you are stuck with a Short position on GME.   You had been short for years and then last year, Ryan Cohen fucked up your plans.  The stock starts running in the wrong direction and then Jan your crony from Citron insults Reddit and it become a shit show.  <strong>You aren't used to losing, especially not to retail so you decided to pull some fuckery.  You get the DTCC/Prime Brokers/ everyone to let you off the hook for the good of the entire market.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>So now you hide your shorts in the options chains and now it's time to convince everyone this is over.</strong>   Retail is stupid, they will be convinced after the stock is hanging in the $40s and we write up a million articles how shorts covered.  So you do that but then a smaller fund gets margin called in Feb and the stock runs up to $350 and again in May.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now these big short guys can literally control the bid/ask on low volume.   Retail is pretty much tapped out as far as cash to buy in.   The believers are all in or in as much as they are comfortable owning.   The paper hands are out.  A lot of Institutional buyers already in for a much lower cost basis but GameStop has not produced enough of a track record for new institutional buyers to start buying in large amounts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So they tried flash crashes but they realized they don't work.  Apes would just buy the dips.  So the new tactic is the slow bleed.  Weeks of just slow red bleeding.   When I was in the Corps, we learned about tactics used in Panama's against General Manuel Noriega.  Noriega loved Opera, and when the US learned this, they blasted Heavy Metal into the compound.  He couldn't sleep, was worried what would happen next.   It drove him nuts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>SHF's know Apes get excited over fast green bars.   What is the opposite of that?   Slow, bleeding red bars for weeks.   The community starts getting worried, people start doubting, and they start to turn on each other throwing FUD accusations around.  Basically, instead of flash crashing they are trying the opposite.   Every time you have hope, they short the fuck out of the stock with ITM puts and sell off their own shares they bought long to drop the price.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is like an infinite amount of cash in the market at this point.   The market should have crashed but the Fed went BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.  There is enough money in circulation to keep this going for months.   So stop buying options and be patient.  </p>
<h1>If you keep supporting GameStop (After some good quarterly numbers), the whales will come.</h1>
<h1>If they want to tank the price to the 130s or lower.....just remember what Mark Cuban said:  The lower the price of the stock, the more power retail has.....</h1>
<p>==============================================================================</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>What I'm doing......</h1>
<h1>I get paid weekly.   Each week I buy more and will continue to do so until these fuckers pay my family back for that bullshit they pulled in Jan, with motherfucking interest.</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Just remember.   Shares never expire....</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Keep Strong.   Apes are right.   You are sitting on a winning lotto ticket.   The numbers have been drawn and you won.....  Now everyone is trying to convince you that you didn't; just so you don't collect your winnings.  They are throwing every obstacle in your way but you hold that winning ticket.  The price of the stock and their manipulation can only last so long.......and at the end of the day if you held......you will change your family's life!</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Apes Strong......</h1>
