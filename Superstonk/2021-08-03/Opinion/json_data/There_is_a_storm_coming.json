    "selftext": "There is a storm coming. Believe it or not they are gonna drop GME at the same time the market crashes to try and scare us apes into selling. We must weather this storm, all we have to do is buy when we can and hold. Don\u2019t let these Fucks scare you with these drops in price. None of it is real. We are close you beautiful apes, one more step closer to changing millions of lives. Stay strong, buy and hold. This is what we worked hard for, all those months of funny ass memes, sacrificing other things to buy more, day after day going to our shit jobs, holding through the highs and lows, watching the fuckery happen day in and day out, we are primed and ready for this moment! Whatever your reasons are, hold strong for those reasons. Everyone\u2019s situation is different, so make your situation a better one! I couldn\u2019t be more proud of any other group of people than I am with this group here! Buy and hold. \n\nThis is not financial advice",
