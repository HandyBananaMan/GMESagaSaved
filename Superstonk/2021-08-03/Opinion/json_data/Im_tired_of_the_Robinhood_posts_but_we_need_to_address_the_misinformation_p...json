This represents a grand total of **2.5% disposed.**\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. SEC Filing (see footnotes): [https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=15125984&RcvdDate=07/28/2021&CoName=ROBINHOOD%20MARKETS,%20INC.&FormType=4&View=html](https://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=15125984&RcvdDate=07/28/2021&CoName=ROBINHOOD%20MARKETS,%20INC.&FormType=4&View=html)\n2. Nasdaq website (see Page 2): [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hood/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hood/insider-activity)\n\n*But he recently acquired 52m shares and disposed off 100m shares on Page 1 at non-open market? Well, I don\u2019t know what the fuck Vladimir is doing here. I\u2019m here to shit on* ***Unusual\\_whales.*** *For what it is worth, I would still consider this insider selling/buying. It\u2019s just on a \u201cdifferent exchange\u201d - directly with brokers.*\n\n*It looks like Mr Vladimir is trying to hide (m\\*\\*k is censored by auto mod?) the sale of his entire holding.*\n\nOther Material Sales:\n\n* Chief Marketing Officer - **100%** disposal (99,884 shares at $35.28, over $3.5 million USD)\n* Chief Financial Officer - **25%** disposal (125,000 at $36.40, over $4.5 million US)\n\n**Unusual\\_whales is a Shill**\n\n[RestartingMyLife0918 with 85 upvotes:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/owg05j/vlad1_douche_canoe/h7fy3e1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n>Reminder that the entire unusual whales team was banned by reddit admins last year for shilling their service and they remade accounts to shill their product here again. Not saying OP is working for them, at least not knowingly, but they are doing nothing other than jumping on hype trains to help get their name spammed everywhere. Seems to be working. I see more unusual whales posts per week than any other twitter account.\n\nThis isn\u2019t my first encounter with this user. To provide further context since unusual\\_whales seems to have a following here on Superstonk. They are actively selling a service. They bait you in with their Tweets, representing \u201cfree data\u201d and then you\u2019re hit with subscription offers for the full package. For as much as this subreddit likes to throw around the label \u201cshill\u201d, here you go.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about what the boy from Bulgaria is doing, he\u2019s pumping and dumping without a doubt. But I am finding myself having to play the role of \u2018devil\u2019s advocate\u2019 a lot here - I think this community really needs to put aside confirmation bias and fact check and critically analyse anything we are presented with. It leaves us wide open to FUD.**\n\n**LinkedIn Users**\n\nWe also hold up random LinkedIn users quite a lot here, just because they have a CFA designation and work in some unrelated role?\n\nI have a CFA designation (almost didn\u2019t given how brutal Level 3 was). It doesn\u2019t make me an authority on anything. LinkedIn users just regurgitate DD and no, they do not provide \u2018exposure to the DD\u2019 via a professional platform. I\u2019ve seen their connections and likes, it\u2018s fucking nothing outside of being recycled on here.\n\nWhy do I say this? Because where we start to hold up LinkedIn users as authority (and I know that there are a lot of Ape that do), we begin to let in FUD:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ltki88cw7f71.jpg?width=1089&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ceccc2f6c93d2aefcf4714964557d6a8cea46cf2\n\nYes Peter, tell me more about the government intervention you speak of, ie the limitation of any squeeze and the designation of a \u2018clearing price\u2019. There are a few substantive arguments against this, and he tries to balance it with reference to what the DTCC and NSCC is proposing to do via \\*market mechanisms (\\*managing the squeeze themselves).\n\nBut this is a) his interpretation of the proposals b) baseless speculation (of government intervention) that will be promoted as authority by Apes. These warrant separate DDs, but all I ever see is screenshots of this guy on Twitter and this subreddit.\n\nI actually had 2 friends read this and reach out to me separately, asking if regulatory intervention or \u201cmanaged squeezes\u201d are likely then wouldn\u2018t it be better to sell the shares before any clearing price. I didn\u2019t know they followed Peter Hann CFA because I only gave them a link to this subreddit. They only came across on highly upvoted posts here.\n\n***EDIT:*** *As for my own disclosures, I have a direct financial interest in providing positive information relating to GameStop to enhance the possibility of a short squeeze.*\n\n*I also work for BlackRock. However, this does not relate to GameStop and I work for a UK entity with no involvement in this specific stock.*",
