<p>Just remember Matt Furlong, the CEO of GameStop, left a cushy job at Amazon to lead GME and his compensation almost entirely in stock are vested at an average of around $230 per share. I know for a fact I am dumber than he is so anything under that price Iâ€™m buying with pure confidence and joy. </p>
