Just remember Matt Furlong, the CEO of GameStop, left a cushy job at Amazon to lead GME and his compensation almost entirely in stock are vested at an average of around $230 per share. I know for a fact I am dumber than he is so anything under that price Iâ€™m buying with pure confidence and joy. 

Rome wasnâ€™t built in a day. If you need instant gratification try pornhub or order a new game from your favorite company.
