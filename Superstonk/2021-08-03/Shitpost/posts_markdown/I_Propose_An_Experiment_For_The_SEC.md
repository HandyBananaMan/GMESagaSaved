Immediately ban any shorting of Gamestop. You know, like the SEC did in 2008 to protect the banks during the housing meltdown. If the SHFs have covered, like they say they have, they shouldnâ€™t care about this. Then we can see what the market truly believes that share price should be. Come on SEC. I dare you. I double, dog dare you!  You have nothing too lose unless you know something the Apes donâ€™t know. Hmmmâ€¦

Edit: many have suggested that the SEC also stop allowing GameStop orders to be routed through Dark Pools. While I agree with this, any good scientist knows you only change one variable at a time when performing an experiment. So once this experiment concludes then we can move on to performing the Dark Pool one. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ
