There was a study from Texas A&M that was highly cited in Superstonk last week upon news of GME moving from the S&P SmallCap 600 to the S&P MidCap 400. I myself wrote a summary of the conclusions of this study on what to expect: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oswfnz/gme\_to\_the\_sp\_midcap\_400\_on\_aug\_4th\_possible/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oswfnz/gme_to_the_sp_midcap_400_on_aug_4th_possible/)

I and others who cited this study missed something very important! The problem is that this study ([https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) lumps promotions from the S&P 600 to the S&P 400 TOGETHER with promotions of non-indexed stocks straight into the S&P 400. Therefore, this did not give us a clear picture of what **specifically** to expect for GME moving **FROM S&P 600 TO S&P 400**.

For GME's specific type of promotion (from **S&P 600 --> S&P 400**), we must turn to a separate study ([https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/1020/Index-Inclusion-is-More-Impactful-than-Warren-Buffetts-Berkshire-Hathaway-v3.pdf](https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/1020/Index-Inclusion-is-More-Impactful-than-Warren-Buffetts-Berkshire-Hathaway-v3.pdf)) which I summarize below.

![\\"larger index\\" here refers to S&P MidCap 400](https://preview.redd.it/cule7agul6f71.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=770f07f21915521f8d6c56689ecb3c3694647e1a)

Okay, so this is the opposite of what the Texas A&M study was inferring, but also specifically referring to promotion **FROM S&P 600 TO S&P 400**. **What SHOULD we have expected upon the S&P 400 news? A dip! What did we get after the news? A DIP**. Nothing out of the ordinary. The **average dip is 5.5% from the announcement of this type of promotion** ("on date of announcement"); The announcement for GME came AH on 7/27. GME closed at $178.54 on 7/27 and then gapped down on 7/28 and closed at $169.12. A dip of $9.42 or **\~5.3%**. This is about as close as you can get to exactly what we should have expected! This was predictable, we just missed it.

![middle bar is the one of interest here](https://preview.redd.it/u1igtv1wn6f71.jpg?width=531&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4695a95b5b6d248293bcd5d91a967b17730078b5)

In fact, it would be **so** **rare** to see a price increase when a stock is promoted from S&P 600 --> S&P 400, that out of the \~300 index changes analyzed in this study, **NOT A SINGLE ONE** showed gains.

![Middle bar shows us how normal a dip after promotion to S&P 400 from S&P 600 is! It would be abnormal to see anything else, in fact!](https://preview.redd.it/atb6b29to6f71.jpg?width=549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f077d85375e3de8889e3fd4bbebd63a83d799da2)

So have the dips AFTER 7/28 also been due to promotion to S&P 400? As this study finds, that is **unlikely**. The dips since 7/28 have probably been SHFs taking advantage of the downward pressure put on the stock by the promotion to S&P 400 and trying to suppress it for as long as possible (my best guess). In addition, the study found **NO TREND on the date of the fund move (TOMORROW for GME)**, **so do not expect any serious price action tomorrow solely due to S&P 400 promotion**. Lastly, don't expect any additional price action (positive or negative) in the next few months that would be attributed to S&P 400 promotion.

Summary (**TLDR**)

* We (I included) misinterpreted that highly cited Texas A&M study that said we should see positive price action from the promotion to S&P 400.
* Instead, **promotion from S&P 600 to S&P 400, specifically, leads to a dip, RELIABLY,** based on a more specific study of this type of promotion. Average dip of 5.5% after announcement - GME dip after announcement 5.3%, **spot on!**
* It is unlikely that any price action after 7/28 has anything to do with S&P 400 and it is more likely SHFs taking advantage of the downward pressure due to the move from S&P 600 --> S&P 400.
* We should not expect any further selling nor buying pressure from GME's move into the S&P 400, including tomorrow when that move becomes official.
* This changes nothing other than you should find comfort that the dip on 7/28 was likely due to promotion into S&P 400 and subsequent dips may be due to SHFs taking advantage of the initial downward pressure.
* I love this stock and continue to buy, hold, and buy some more.

Not financial advice, you all know that.

edit1: typo, thanks u/guerillasouldier

edit2: A lot have mentioned GXO Logistics (GXO) and Victoria's Secret (VSCO), both of which are also moving into the S&P 400 and are seeing gains, not dips. Remember, both VSCO and GXO are moving from **non-indexed** into the S&P 400. This is a completely different index move from what GME is making (S&P 600--> S&P 400). Based on the graphs in the study, this is also to be expected.

edit3: I also did a qualitative volume analysis you can see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxing8/sp\_midcap\_400\_promotion\_tomorrow\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxing8/sp_midcap_400_promotion_tomorrow_volume/)
