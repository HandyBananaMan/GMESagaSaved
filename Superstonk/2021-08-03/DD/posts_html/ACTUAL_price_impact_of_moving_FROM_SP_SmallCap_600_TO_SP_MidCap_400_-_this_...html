<p>There was a study from Texas A&amp;M that was highly cited in Superstonk last week upon news of GME moving from the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 to the S&amp;P MidCap 400. I myself wrote a summary of the conclusions of this study on what to expect: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oswfnz/gme_to_the_sp_midcap_400_on_aug_4th_possible/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oswfnz/gme_to_the_sp_midcap_400_on_aug_4th_possible/</a></p>
<p>I and others who cited this study missed something very important! The problem is that this study (<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.7114&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>) lumps promotions from the S&amp;P 600 to the S&amp;P 400 TOGETHER with promotions of non-indexed stocks straight into the S&amp;P 400. Therefore, this did not give us a clear picture of what <strong>specifically</strong> to expect for GME moving <strong>FROM S&amp;P 600 TO S&amp;P 400</strong>.</p>

<p>For GME's specific type of promotion (from <strong>S&amp;P 600 --&gt; S&amp;P 400</strong>), we must turn to a separate study (<a href="https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/1020/Index-Inclusion-is-More-Impactful-than-Warren-Buffetts-Berkshire-Hathaway-v3.pdf">https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/1020/Index-Inclusion-is-More-Impactful-than-Warren-Buffetts-Berkshire-Hathaway-v3.pdf</a>) which I summarize below.</p>
<p><img alt="\&quot;larger index\&quot; here refers to S&amp;P MidCap 400" src="https://preview.redd.it/cule7agul6f71.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=770f07f21915521f8d6c56689ecb3c3694647e1a" /></p>
<p>Okay, so this is the opposite of what the Texas A&amp;M study was inferring, but also specifically referring to promotion <strong>FROM S&amp;P 600 TO S&amp;P 400</strong>. <strong>What SHOULD we have expected upon the S&amp;P 400 news? A dip! What did we get after the news? A DIP</strong>. Nothing out of the ordinary. The <strong>average dip is 5.5% from the announcement of this type of promotion</strong> ("on date of announcement"); The announcement for GME came AH on 7/27. GME closed at $178.54 on 7/27 and then gapped down on 7/28 and closed at $169.12. A dip of $9.42 or <strong>\~5.3%</strong>. This is about as close as you can get to exactly what we should have expected! This was predictable, we just missed it.</p>
<p><img alt="middle bar is the one of interest here" src="https://preview.redd.it/u1igtv1wn6f71.jpg?width=531&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4695a95b5b6d248293bcd5d91a967b17730078b5" /></p>
<p>In fact, it would be <strong>so</strong> <strong>rare</strong> to see a price increase when a stock is promoted from S&amp;P 600 --&gt; S&amp;P 400, that out of the \~300 index changes analyzed in this study, <strong>NOT A SINGLE ONE</strong> showed gains.</p>
<p><img alt="Middle bar shows us how normal a dip after promotion to S&amp;P 400 from S&amp;P 600 is! It would be abnormal to see anything else, in fact!" src="https://preview.redd.it/atb6b29to6f71.jpg?width=549&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f077d85375e3de8889e3fd4bbebd63a83d799da2" /></p>
<p>So have the dips AFTER 7/28 also been due to promotion to S&amp;P 400? As this study finds, that is <strong>unlikely</strong>. The dips since 7/28 have probably been SHFs taking advantage of the downward pressure put on the stock by the promotion to S&amp;P 400 and trying to suppress it for as long as possible (my best guess). In addition, the study found <strong>NO TREND on the date of the fund move (TOMORROW for GME)</strong>, <strong>so do not expect any serious price action tomorrow solely due to S&amp;P 400 promotion</strong>. Lastly, don't expect any additional price action (positive or negative) in the next few months that would be attributed to S&amp;P 400 promotion.</p>

<p>Summary (<strong>TLDR</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li>We (I included) misinterpreted that highly cited Texas A&amp;M study that said we should see positive price action from the promotion to S&amp;P 400.</li>
<li>Instead, <strong>promotion from S&amp;P 600 to S&amp;P 400, specifically, leads to a dip, RELIABLY,</strong> based on a more specific study of this type of promotion. Average dip of 5.5% after announcement - GME dip after announcement 5.3%, <strong>spot on!</strong></li>
<li>It is unlikely that any price action after 7/28 has anything to do with S&amp;P 400 and it is more likely SHFs taking advantage of the downward pressure due to the move from S&amp;P 600 --&gt; S&amp;P 400.</li>
<li>We should not expect any further selling nor buying pressure from GME's move into the S&amp;P 400, including tomorrow when that move becomes official.</li>
<li>This changes nothing other than you should find comfort that the dip on 7/28 was likely due to promotion into S&amp;P 400 and subsequent dips may be due to SHFs taking advantage of the initial downward pressure.</li>
<li>I love this stock and continue to buy, hold, and buy some more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not financial advice, you all know that.</p>

<p>edit1: typo, thanks u/guerillasouldier</p>
<p>edit2: A lot have mentioned GXO Logistics (GXO) and Victoria's Secret (VSCO), both of which are also moving into the S&amp;P 400 and are seeing gains, not dips. Remember, both VSCO and GXO are moving from <strong>non-indexed</strong> into the S&amp;P 400. This is a completely different index move from what GME is making (S&amp;P 600--&gt; S&amp;P 400). Based on the graphs in the study, this is also to be expected.</p>
<p>edit3: I also did a qualitative volume analysis you can see here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxing8/sp_midcap_400_promotion_tomorrow_volume/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxing8/sp_midcap_400_promotion_tomorrow_volume/</a></p>
