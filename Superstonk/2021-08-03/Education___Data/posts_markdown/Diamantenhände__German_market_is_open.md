Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! üëãü¶ç

Yesterday's Diamantenh√§nde thread was a refreshing boost after it had hit some doldrums recently - thank you to everyone who posted and participated, and I hope that we can keep it going again today. Apes help Apes - you may not realize it, but the knowledge that there are many others around the world, from all different backgrounds, who also love this stock and *show up* daily to sustain other Apes... it's a beautiful thing. This community is what makes HODLing for the MOASS possible for many of us. There is a lot of effort going into making us distrust each other; into becoming disillusioned with the stock we like. Let us take a few hours together to simply enjoy these good times before they are gone. There has never been a better time to HODL GME.

Today is Tuesday, August 3rd, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!

FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18669994. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)

I've asked u/thecactusblender to cover a few days later this week when I am not certain I'd be able to run this thread. Thank you so much to them for stepping in to help!

Diamantenh√§nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!
