Well, weren't those last two minutes of today's trading exciting! Wut Happened?? Crime happened.

Wut Crime? Banging the close.

Banging, sounds sexual, maybe the SEC might actually be into this ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüçÜ? But wuts "Banging the Close"? Well, according to the CTFC - 

" **Banging the Close**: A manipulative or disruptive trading practice whereby a trader buys or sells a large number of futures contracts during the closing period of a futures contract (that is, the period during which the futures settlement price is determined) in order to benefit an even larger position in an option, swap, or other derivative that is cash settled based on the futures settlement price on that day. "

But that says "futures", GME is a stonk. Yes, GME is a stonk, but the principle still remains true, especially given the derivatives/options on GME are at levels that exceed the shares in existence. Well, real, authentic shares at least.

&#x200B;

But, there was a index rebalance, maybe that was it? Well, yes, GME stonk is moving from the S&P 600 to the S&P 400 tomorrow, the stonk needed to be bought and sold by ETFs/Mutual Funds. By 3:50 PM EST on 8/3/21, a report was published by the NYSE stating GME has a large order imbalance of 2,196,034 shares on the buy side to account for this.

What happened next was crime. Even the obsolete, basic data available for "dumb money" apes can prove it. How? Simply Looking üëÄ.

According to the data from [Market Chameleon](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/GME/Stock-Price-Action/VWAP), the regular session for GME trading on 8/3/21 had 3,100,172 shares traded, and 1,097,377 shares traded in the final 10 minutes of the trading session. Yes, 1/3 of the days volume occurred in the final 10 minutes. See below -

Notice that crazy candle on 3:58 PM EST on 8/3/21 on the GME Chart? Hard to miss. Wut happened? 

* Between 3:50 - 3:57 PM EST, GME traded 604,866 shares, and the price rose about $5/share from 154 to 158.89. This makes sense, considering NYSE said 2,196,034 shares needed to be purchased based on the order imbalance, and when there are more buyers than sellers, the price should rise (although GME is trying it's best to disprove this theory). 
* During the last two minutes of the day, 492,491 shares were traded, all being dumped on bids, to tank the price nearly $7/share to close the day of 8/3/21 at $152.75/share. These trades were not purchases, but rather sales, otherwise the price would not have printed on the bids, or below the bids, for the last two minutes of trade.
* The buying between 3:50-3:57 was almost perfectly offset by the selling in the final two minutes, which on a typical day is expected by now by the market ~~manipulators~~ makers, and GME closed on the day with what was likely still around 2 million shares of order imbalance on the NYSE.
* After hours, more than 10 million shares were traded, one block consisting on 6.6 million shares at 152.75, off exchange in a darkpool, or ADF.
* From 3:58 PM EST, 1,105 option trades were made, totaling 3,566 contracts. No way the MMs/HFT algos behind the closing bang had anything to do with this massive increase in option trading, right?

So, wonderful regulators and SEC, I ask you, are you going to look into who "banged the close" to drop the price $7 in 2 minutes, what accounts those 3,566 option contracts that traded during the same time belong to, and did the party/parties involved in the bang turn around and fill an order for 10 times the volume after hours at the lower price? Thank you in advance for doing nothing, other than adding another chapter to the story of how the SEC has failed to do anything it was created for. See you again tomorrow.

Edit 1 - Adding some clarification to help answer/address some of the comments/questions- Over 2 million shares needed to be bought after 3:50 pm to balance the nyse order book. 600k shares were purchased from 350 to 357 pm est, and this buying caused price to rise. The last 2 minutes, however, 500k shares were sold, taking the price back down. The volume needed to bring nyse back into balance never materialized during the 10 minutes after the imbalance was reported, only about half the volume needed appeared, yet almost half that volume was selling, not buying. I find it impossible the 500k of share sales was a bona fide trade, since this occurred prior to the buy imbalance being settled. So either someone banged the close, or they failed to report the 1.6 million share purchases to close the imbalance to the tape to justify a bona-fide sale of 500k shares in the final 2 minutes. Blatant fuckery, even if it somehow wasn't banging the close to get a better moc price for the after hours index rebalancing trades.
