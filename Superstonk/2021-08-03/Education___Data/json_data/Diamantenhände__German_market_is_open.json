    "selftext": "Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! \ud83d\udc4b\ud83e\udd8d\n\nYesterday's Diamantenh\u00e4nde thread was a refreshing boost after it had hit some doldrums recently - thank you to everyone who posted and participated, and I hope that we can keep it going again today. Apes help Apes - you may not realize it, but the knowledge that there are many others around the world, from all different backgrounds, who also love this stock and *show up* daily to sustain other Apes... it's a beautiful thing. This community is what makes HODLing for the MOASS possible for many of us. There is a lot of effort going into making us distrust each other; into becoming disillusioned with the stock we like. Let us take a few hours together to simply enjoy these good times before they are gone. There has never been a better time to HODL GME.\n\nToday is Tuesday, August 3rd, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80\n***\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 120 minutes in: **$158.11 / 133,24 \u20ac**  *(volume: 916)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 115 minutes in: $158.20 / 133,31 \u20ac  *(volume: 895)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 110 minutes in: $158.13 / 133,25 \u20ac  *(volume: 878)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 105 minutes in: $157.91 / 133,06 \u20ac  *(volume: 866)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 100 minutes in: $157.73 / 132,91 \u20ac  *(volume: 861)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 95 minutes in: $157.96 / 133,11 \u20ac  *(volume: 850)*\r\n- \u2b1c 90 minutes in: $157.50 / 132,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 846)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 85 minutes in: $157.50 / 132,72 \u20ac  *(volume: 836)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 80 minutes in: $157.43 / 132,66 \u20ac  *(volume: 833)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 75 minutes in: $158.16 / 133,27 \u20ac  *(volume: 623)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 70 minutes in: $157.74 / 132,93 \u20ac  *(volume: 593)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 65 minutes in: $156.66 / 132,01 \u20ac  *(volume: 390)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 60 minutes in: $156.69 / 132,04 \u20ac  *(volume: 379)*\r\n- \u2b1c 55 minutes in: $156.70 / 132,05 \u20ac  *(volume: 377)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 50 minutes in: $156.70 / 132,05 \u20ac  *(volume: 375)*\r\n- \u2b1c 45 minutes in: $156.64 / 132,00 \u20ac  *(volume: 371)*\r\n- \u2b1c 40 minutes in: $156.64 / 132,00 \u20ac  *(volume: 370)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 35 minutes in: $156.64 / 132,00 \u20ac  *(volume: 355)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 30 minutes in: $157.16 / 132,44 \u20ac  *(volume: 253)*\r\n- \u2b1c 25 minutes in: $157.15 / 132,43 \u20ac  *(volume: 200)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 20 minutes in: $157.15 / 132,43 \u20ac  *(volume: 178)*\r\n- \u2b1c 15 minutes in: $157.21 / 132,48 \u20ac  *(volume: 163)*\r\n- \u2b1c 10 minutes in: $157.21 / 132,48 \u20ac  *(volume: 163)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 5 minutes in: $157.21 / 132,48 \u20ac  *(volume: 161)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 0 minutes in: $157.39 / 132,62 \u20ac  *(volume: 141)*\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 US close price: $157.65 / 132,85 \u20ac   *($156.48 / 131,86 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n***\nFAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18669994. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)\n\nI've asked u/thecactusblender to cover a few days later this week when I am not certain I'd be able to run this thread. Thank you so much to them for stepping in to help!\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
