<p>Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! 👋🦍</p>
<p>Yesterday's Diamantenhände thread was a refreshing boost after it had hit some doldrums recently - thank you to everyone who posted and participated, and I hope that we can keep it going again today. Apes help Apes - you may not realize it, but the knowledge that there are many others around the world, from all different backgrounds, who also love this stock and <em>show up</em> daily to sustain other Apes... it's a beautiful thing. This community is what makes HODLing for the MOASS possible for many of us. There is a lot of effort going into making us distrust each other; into becoming disillusioned with the stock we like. Let us take a few hours together to simply enjoy these good times before they are gone. There has never been a better time to HODL GME.</p>
<p>Today is Tuesday, August 3rd, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from the German markets!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>

<p>FAQ: I'm capturing current price and volume data from German exchanges and converting to USD. Today's euro -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.18669994. I wrote and maintain a C# application that assists me in fetching this data and updating the post. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check <a href="https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie">Lang &amp; Schwarz</a> or <a href="https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099">TradeGate</a></p>
<p>I've asked u/thecactusblender to cover a few days later this week when I am not certain I'd be able to run this thread. Thank you so much to them for stepping in to help!</p>
