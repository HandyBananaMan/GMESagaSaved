Volkswagen squeezed to $800 with 12% short interest.

Tesla squeezed to almost $5000 and then did the 5-1 split on 20% short interest.

We know for a fact that GME is shorted more than 100% because of the 10k filing from March that stated as much. 

The price movement since it was confirmed to have been over 100% shorted since March has been crazy. 
That leads to some speculation that short interest must be 500%+ (and that's pretty conservative)

The recent price movement is to scare off you new guys/ on the fence of wether to get in or not.
