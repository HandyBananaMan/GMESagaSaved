Im a smooth brained ape, but I remember that I read about S&P 500 qualification criteria.

They are

1. a [market cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $13.1 billion (as of June 2021 guidance)
2. the value of its market [capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp)trade annually
3. at least a quarter-million of its [shares](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-can-i-buy-sp-500-fund/)trade in each of the previous six months
4. most of its shares in the public’s      hands
5. at least a year since its [initial public      offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)
6. the sum of the previous four quarters      of earnings must be positive as well as the most recent quarter

So, last time I had a look at this, we only missed point 6. With the huge increase in customers and free pr gamestop have received the last 10 moths, I have reason to believe that we can see a positive quarter, and possibly a that the sum of the four last quarters will be positive. The HF’s can’t fight this, so how to keep us out of S&P 500? Lower the GME market cap. Right now, the fight is not at $180, but at $170.52 (13.1B / 76.82 M =  170.5285 )

Could I request an adult to look into this?
