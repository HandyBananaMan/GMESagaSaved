<p>Volkswagen squeezed to $800 with 12% short interest.</p>
<p>Tesla squeezed to almost $5000 and then did the 5-1 split on 20% short interest.</p>
<p>We know for a fact that GME is shorted more than 100% because of the 10k filing from March that stated as much. </p>
<p>The price movement since it was confirmed to have been over 100% shorted since March has been crazy. 
That leads to some speculation that short interest must be 500%+ (and that's pretty conservative)</p>
<p>The recent price movement is to scare off you new guys/ on the fence of wether to get in or not.</p>
