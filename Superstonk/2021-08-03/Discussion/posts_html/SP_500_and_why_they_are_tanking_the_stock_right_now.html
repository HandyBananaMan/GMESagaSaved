<p>Im a smooth brained ape, but I remember that I read about S&amp;P 500 qualification criteria.</p>
<p>They are</p>
<ol>
<li>a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp">market cap</a> of $13.1 billion (as of June 2021 guidance)</li>
<li>the value of its market <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp">capitalization</a>trade annually</li>
<li>at least a quarter-million of its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-can-i-buy-sp-500-fund/">shares</a>trade in each of the previous six months</li>
<li>most of its shares in the public’s      hands</li>
<li>at least a year since its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp">initial public      offering</a></li>
<li>the sum of the previous four quarters      of earnings must be positive as well as the most recent quarter</li>
</ol>

<p>So, last time I had a look at this, we only missed point 6. With the huge increase in customers and free pr gamestop have received the last 10 moths, I have reason to believe that we can see a positive quarter, and possibly a that the sum of the four last quarters will be positive. The HF’s can’t fight this, so how to keep us out of S&amp;P 500? Lower the GME market cap. Right now, the fight is not at $180, but at $170.52 (13.1B / 76.82 M =  170.5285 )</p>

<p>Could I request an adult to look into this?</p>
