    "selftext": "Volkswagen squeezed to $800 with 12% short interest.\n\nTesla squeezed to almost $5000 and then did the 5-1 split on 20% short interest.\n\nWe know for a fact that GME is shorted more than 100% because of the 10k filing from March that stated as much. \n\nThe price movement since it was confirmed to have been over 100% shorted since March has been crazy. \nThat leads to some speculation that short interest must be 500%+ (and that's pretty conservative)\n\nThe recent price movement is to scare off you new guys/ on the fence of wether to get in or not.",
