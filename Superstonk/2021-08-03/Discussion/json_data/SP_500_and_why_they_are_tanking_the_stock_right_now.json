    "selftext": "Im a smooth brained ape, but I remember that I read about S&P 500 qualification criteria.\n\nThey are\n\n1. a [market cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapitalization.asp) of $13.1 billion (as of June 2021 guidance)\n2. the value of its market [capitalization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization.asp)trade annually\n3. at least a quarter-million of its [shares](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-can-i-buy-sp-500-fund/)trade in each of the previous six months\n4. most of its shares in the public\u2019s      hands\n5. at least a year since its [initial public      offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp)\n6. the sum of the previous four quarters      of earnings must be positive as well as the most recent quarter\n\n\\- [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090414/sp-500-index-you-need-know.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090414/sp-500-index-you-need-know.asp)\n\nSo, last time I had a look at this, we only missed point 6. With the huge increase in customers and free pr gamestop have received the last 10 moths, I have reason to believe that we can see a positive quarter, and possibly a that the sum of the four last quarters will be positive. The HF\u2019s can\u2019t fight this, so how to keep us out of S&P 500? Lower the GME market cap. Right now, the fight is not at $180, but at $170.52 (13.1B / 76.82 M =  170.5285 )\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0nops1pv3f71.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=209cd632f3216730ca16288abe1e8e923ffdb52c\n\nCould I request an adult to look into this?\n\nEdit: Meme\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00h2v2hlx3f71.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e320f349a31d1ed174e62f7f52b35a88de69c41",
