I was not going to post this as a part 2, as i found this last night high AF, and pretty lit on bourbon. But today is a new day. As a Brazilian, and American citizen, its my duty to serve you primates some food.

***FOREWARD***

Part 1: Brazil shorts are funneled through the umbrella of Bradesco / Banco Bradesco / Banco Brasil / Bank of Brazil/ BB  in S. FL., they have a new securities issue BTW through CITI BANK as of next month. Credit to the various other OPs bringing this stuff to light.

***CONTEXT***

New shit: adding on to the Brazil short situation from OPs before I, I got too curious and decided to look. Who else is Interested in Brazil shitty economics? Apparently quite a few. And guess where their new favorite spot is for business? It sure as hell isnt the famous colony states of the north. 

South Florida, baby.

Ballsack72 is there, Citadel spent almost a year at the Four Seasons WPB, April 2020 to March 2021; I am sure it was posted here before. Fuck a paywall, does it even matter with the follow 2nd link? THEY RENTED OUT THE FOUR SEASONS AS A TRADING FLOOR.

ELA: Florida is the new hot shit, while the north is boring AF. Like Scar Face, its a port for all rats of life. Uncle Ben, AKA Obi Wan, was speaking the truth. This all has been in the works for years, Brazil is on the silver platter currently.
