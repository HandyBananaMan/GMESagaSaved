<h1>Title: Reminder: NOBODY has covered. DOESN'T matter if a few paperhand early. The stock is shorted MULTIPLE times over. RC knows what he's doing. Those short shares WILL be returned and bought from YOU. My floor is ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH. This will NEVER happen again.</h1>

<p>Everyday is hype day.  I knew from day one - this wouldn't be a walk in the park.  They will fuck with the price, they will fuck with the news, the sub.  All is good - I hodl.  Ape always seem to be buying, and I know ape hodl.  Zen.  Just enjoy today.  Enjoy tomorrow.  The future is bright.  I think all ape know potential is unlimited.</p>
<p>Edit: we're in a sub for GME.  This post gets a ton of upvotes, then gets hammered with downvotes.  Been happening for over an hour. Curious.  Who would so aggressively downvote this post in a pro GME sub?  Weird.</p>
