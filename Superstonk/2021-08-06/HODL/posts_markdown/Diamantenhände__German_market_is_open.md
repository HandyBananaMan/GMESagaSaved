Guten Morgen to all of you Great Apes around the world! üëãü¶ç

I am filling in for our good friend u/Parsnip today! It was nice to see some green action, but we still know the price is wrong, bitch! Meanwhile, Gary Gensler flipped CNBC the bird by posting the cut portion of his interview on Twitter! *We will watch your career with great interest*

Today is Friday, August 6th, and of course you know what that means! Join other apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange!

üöÄ Buckle Up! üöÄ

FAQ: I am not as fancy as our friend u/Parsnip; I am just checking the price on [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) and converting to USD in Google. Today's euro -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18229. If you'd like to check current prices directly, you can check [Lang & Schwarz](https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie) or [TradeGate](https://www.tradegate.de/orderbuch.php?isin=US36467W1099)
