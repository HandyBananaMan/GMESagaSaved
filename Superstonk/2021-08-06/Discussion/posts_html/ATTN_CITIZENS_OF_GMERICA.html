<p>With the highly-anticipated release of the Gamestop NFT hopefully in the near future, I have reason to believe that there is BLATANT FUCKERY AFOOT with the Senate and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oyxejb/white_house_comes_out_in_support_of/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;context=3">White House</a> right now.</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner and Sen. Rob Portman have slipped in <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1423429377459736577?s=21">this amendment</a> into the newly written $1-Trillion bill for infrastructure. These amendments may seem harmless and complicated to those of us who don't know much about cryp t03. DO NOT BE FOOLED.  If passed, this amendment would effectively restrict/destroy the innovative industries that are going to be working with the upgraded Ethereum 2.0 Blockchain in the United States - as the upgrade switches from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) . That includes our beloved NFTs if a dividend is released. WTAF!</p>
<p>Link to an informative video from a wrinkle on the subject: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=JEF8dwF36qY&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ab_channel=CharlesHoskinson">youtube.com/watch?v=JEF8dwF36qY&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ab_channel=CharlesHoskinson</a></p>
<p>From what it seems, the government doesn't understand the consequences that these new rules would have on investors and innovators alike if they are implemented... Either that, or they are purposefully trying to keep digital currency centralized in order to protect the banks and institutions from doing what they do best (Naked Short Selling).  Whatever the reason may be (it's definitely the latter), the ramifications of this bill are "sweeping and massively damaging" according to the executive director of the Blockchain Association - Kristin Smith. Regardless, they are targeting Ethereum and other digital currencies, the Senate is framing it as a way to reduce tax evasion in the cryp t03 markets.</p>
<p>Call for Action: REACH OUT TO YOUR SENATORS <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm">https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm</a> LET THEM KNOW THAT IF THEY VOTE YES FOR THE WARNER-PORTMAN-SINEMA PLAN THAT YOU WILL MAKE SURE THEY DO NOT GET RE-ELECTED FOR OFFICE</p>

<p>I have the smoothest brain out of all of you fucking morons and we really need more discussion about this in the comments down below.</p>
<p>Shout out to u/TempMobileD for bringing this to my attention. He has stated "anyone who runs an ether node would be forced to conduct KYC, which isn’t possible. Therefore running a node would become illegal. The whole thing is totally bananas, and not our favourite kind."</p>
<p>Edit: u/Philbojbaggins pointed out in the comments that we also need eyes on the Wyvern Amendment. Listen, i don’t know jack shit about crypto or blockchain or DEFI or KYC, all i know is that i don’t want the government or the banks to have power over that shit. I want Gamestop to rocket to alpha centauri and be the greatest company in the world. I would really appreciate a DD on this matter.</p>

You don’t have to listen to me - listen to the nft team themselves. Taking a few minutes of action is all you need to do to support the stock. We cannot disappoint our fellow europoors depending on us. Taking action will only help ensure the NFT goes smoothly in the future.</p>
<p>THE VOTE IS HAPPENING TOMORROW, LETS MAKE SURE GME NFT TEAM’S HARD WORK DOESN’T GO TO WASTE</p>
