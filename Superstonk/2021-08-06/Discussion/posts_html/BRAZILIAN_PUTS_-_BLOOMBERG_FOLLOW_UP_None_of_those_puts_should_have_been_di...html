<p>Many questions were raised after I posted "Brazilian Puts - Bloomberg Says They Were A Bug and Have Been Addressed": <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxv148/brazilian_puts_bloomberg_says_they_were_a_bug_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oxv148/brazilian_puts_bloomberg_says_they_were_a_bug_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>I consolidated those questions and resubmitted them to Bloomberg. The communication below is in reverse chronological order. Note that 'Grant' replied to my last email, so my questions (last pic) are from a word doc I cut and past from to submit inside Bloomberg.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Bloomberg says "None of those puts should have been displayed as they were not puts on GME." "This issue was isolated to GME."</p>

<p>Edit 1: Here are the Bloomberg screenshots of the referenced Brazilian puts. As my correspondence with Bloomberg points out, they were only in the system for a day or two and they were the only puts with listed strike prices and expiration dates.</p>
