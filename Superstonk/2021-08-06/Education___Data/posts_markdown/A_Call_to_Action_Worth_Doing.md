Congress is voting **TODAY** on an infrastructure bill that could potentially be disastrous for the Crypto space. I'm not kidding, today congress will basically be voting on **PROOF OF STAKE** VS **PROOF OF WORK**. The former is what Ethereum 2.0 has been working on for so long, that london hardfork that we all upvoted and got hyped about? That is Ethereum 2.0, that **IS** Proof of Stake. The dinosaurs in congress are trying to kill the future of crypto right now.

Listen, I cannot tell you exactly what this will do for our potential gamestop NFT dividend, but I do know that it is not good. The bad guys trying to kill proof of stake and over-regulate it are FUNDED by big banks.

"Both [Warner](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/mark-warner/summary?cid=N00002097&__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_d81b008ac0241993d385e318e9a9dc480742f027-1628221811-0-gqNtZGzNAzijcnBszQj6) & [Portman](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/rob-portman/summary?cid=N00003682&cycle=2020&type=I)  are, as expected, funded by big banks and investment institutions.  Portman is funded by BlackRock, American Financial Group, other archaic  institutions that derive great benefit from over regulating DeFi/Proof  of stake networks. Warner is funded by Goldman Sachs. By making DeFi  hard to access for end users, these institutions get to keep their close  sources legacy financial system that oppresses its participants and  funnels wealth to those at the top.

Sen.  Portman is even retiring next month. His absolute last act as a Senator  is to attempt to kill innovation in finance, kill individual freedom ,  and instead enslave people to behemoth corporations. These are the  dinosaurs that the country deserves? Why are these people who have zero  stake in tomorrow writing laws that will harm millions of tomorrow's  kids and prevent them from accessing an open and inclusive financial  system?"

Ok, so Call to Action. It's good that apes have a healthy skepticism for anything Call to Action wise, but our community is SO active. We can make a real difference today, the reality is that this bill DOES affect the future of Crypto and the NFT space. What can you do? Easy: Support the good guys (Toomey, Wyden, and Loomis) who are trying to AMEND the horrible infrastructure bill that is being voted on today. I've never called a senator in my life, probably because i never gave a shit. But i know we all give 10 shits about our financial future, SO JUST CALL.

Help us preserve financial privacy and independence in crypto. Make your voice heard! Call **517-200-9518** and you’ll be automatically connected to your senator.  

Tell them: 

“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support Senator Toomey, Wyden and  Lummis’ amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure  bill (H.R. 3684). I'm also asking you to vote NO on Senator Warner's and Portman's Amendment. Toomey’s amendment will ensure that the provision does not dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, or  undermine human rights. Policies that impact basic freedom and the  future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be  attached to must-pass bills. Thank you.”

Edit: The reason I put "call to action" in the title was specifically to be upfront that this is exactly what this post is. There is no hidden agenda, I am not a shill, this is REAL and it affects what THE GAMESTOP NFT DEVELOPERS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW.

Proof of Work has massive problems with scalability, this is why ethereum devs have been working so hard to make Eth 2.0 proof of stake. It's why the gamestop NFT developers were WAITING specifically for it to go live. Do you remember when the lead gamestop NFT dev specifically tweeted about waiting for ETH 2.0 to drop in August? It's because proof of stake is scalable to work fast and efficiently with millions of users. With harsh regulations on proof of stake, there is no way that future projects can scale to support MILLIONS OF USERS.

**They are purely targeting the developers and validators.**
