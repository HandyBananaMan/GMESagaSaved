    "selftext": "I love checking the daily Reverse Repos and seeing my favorite stock's volume get lower and lower by the minute, but we should have a daily high score update for IEX orders on GME! \n\nWhile the Reverse Repos and volume is out of our control, the ability to increase the amount of orders through IEX is possible for every ape to partake in. I recently started routing my buys through IEX and it feels good to do the right thing. If we keep routing orders through a proper exchange like IEX, we can stop shares from being traded in dark pools. \n\nIf someone is up for being the IEX guy, give it a shot! I'm not sure how to view the number of shares traded on which exchange daily, but if I knew how to I would be up for posting daily updates.\n\nEdit: I figured out how to find IEX info! I guess I'll post daily updates now!\n\nEdit 2: Just made the first IEX post! Buckle up!",
