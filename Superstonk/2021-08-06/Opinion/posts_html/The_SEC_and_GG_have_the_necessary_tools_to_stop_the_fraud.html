<p>Fuck the SEC. Let's all sing kumbayah and happy songs about GG literally just tweeting a clip from his interview. Don't forget the SEC has always had and continue to have the tools and authority to stop the blatant fraud immediately. They could have put in restrictions months ago, but they knew how big of a problem it is so now they have to dance around and protect their friends before pulling the trigger. Their hesitancy to act is heinous, and the grandstanding and outward pandering is disgusting. Don't tell us about Dark Pools, actually suspend the one in question. You're the chairman of the fucking SEC for fucks sake.</p>
