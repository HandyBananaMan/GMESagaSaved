<p>I love checking the daily Reverse Repos and seeing my favorite stock's volume get lower and lower by the minute, but we should have a daily high score update for IEX orders on GME! </p>
<p>While the Reverse Repos and volume is out of our control, the ability to increase the amount of orders through IEX is possible for every ape to partake in. I recently started routing my buys through IEX and it feels good to do the right thing. If we keep routing orders through a proper exchange like IEX, we can stop shares from being traded in dark pools. </p>
<p>If someone is up for being the IEX guy, give it a shot! I'm not sure how to view the number of shares traded on which exchange daily, but if I knew how to I would be up for posting daily updates.</p>
<p>Edit: I figured out how to find IEX info! I guess I'll post daily updates now!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Just made the first IEX post! Buckle up!</p>
