<p>I have lost a good bit of faith in the integrity of the U.S. capital markets. And that is an extraordinary thing for me to state publicly. </p>
<p>Over a legal practice spanning 27 years as a U.S. capital markets &amp; securities lawyer at some of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the world as well as at my own current independent practice, I NEVER thought I would reach this conclusion at the age of 51. </p>
<p>I am now convinced that large swathes of the U.S. equity capital markets are rigged and heavily manipulated against retail individual investors by some of the largest institutions who are entrusted (ill-advisedly) with the smooth functioning of the markets and by a slew of very large, very powerful hedge funds whose insatiable greed and ability to illegally manipulate the equity markets in broad daylight (and in dark pools) is astonishing — as it is deeply disgusting. </p>
<p>The SEC, for whom I have abiding respect, appears to be unwilling or incapable of taking “real-time” action to counter these blatant manipulative activities which millions of unwashed “apes” — so-called dumb money — have exposed over the last several months of the GameStop and XMC sagas. </p>
<p>How else do you explain that XMC [note: edited by OP as usual replacing the A by an X to be able to post the article on superstonk]with an official outstanding public float of 513 million shares now incontrovertibly appears to have SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION SHARES MORE outstanding? Well beyond any reasonable explanation that could be traced back to legal shorting or re-hypothecation of shares. </p>
<p>The only logical explanation is the illegal practices of naked shorting and related printing of synthetic shares. </p>
<p>These practices are not merely frowned upon. THEY ARE ILLEGAL under U.S. securities laws. </p>
<p>Every day that the SEC stands by without taking action is another day when the confidence of individual retail investors in the United States and around the world is being eroded. </p>
<p>This includes yours truly. </p>
<p>THAT should worry anyone who is interested in maintaining the integrity and reputation of the U.S. capital markets. </p>
