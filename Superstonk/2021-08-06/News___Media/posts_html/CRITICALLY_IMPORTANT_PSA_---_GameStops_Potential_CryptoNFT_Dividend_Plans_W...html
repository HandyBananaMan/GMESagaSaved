<li><strong>THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL PASSED</strong></li>
<li>It passed w/ slightly positive (but not nearly good enough) changes Per Jake Chervinsky (tweet linked below):</li>

<li><em>"EVEN IF BILL PASSES RELEVANT CRYPTO PROVISION WON'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL 2023" IS ABSOLUTELY</em> <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> <em>AN EXCUSE FOR APES TO RELAX AND SKIP CALLING/EMAILING YOUR SENATORS BEFORE THEY VOTE SAT 8/7!!!!</em></li>

<li><em>1: ALL APES SHOULD CALL THEIR STATE SENATORS BEFORE THEY VOTE</em></li>

<li><em>MY POINT IN POSTING THIS, IS TO PREEMPT ANY POTENTIAL FUD (IF THE BILL PASSES AS-IS WITH THE HORRENDOUS</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/robportman">PORTMAN</a><em>-</em><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkWarner">WARNER</a> <em>CRYPTO/NFT PROVISION) BY GETTING AHEAD AND INFORMING APES THAT (IN THAT EVENT) THIS FIGHT WOULD BE FAR FROM OVER!</em></li>
