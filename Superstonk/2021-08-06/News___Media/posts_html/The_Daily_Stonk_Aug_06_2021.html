<p>It is a wonderful day to be up and in the jungle!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Get up off your butt, do 3 sets of 5 squats, look at that butt and say "thank god for leg day." You're going to need it to carry you to the end of this long post because yesterday was a doozy!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oy8oox/163000000_shares_owned_by_us_retail_minimum/">Murica</a> Based odd an average ape holding of 34.02 shares we own 163.66M Shares.</p>

<p>The largest pension fund in Japan (GPIF) dropped their US bond holdings from approximately <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-01/world-s-biggest-pension-fund-cuts-u-s-bond-weighting-by-record">47% to 35%</a> of their portfolio from Mar 2020 to Mar 2021.</p>

<p>If this faith keeps dropping with inflation, the raw materials shortages, fair wage strike, and a housing bubble/extreme rent charges tie that to our little slice of the pie and we have a bone-uh-fide category 5 sheeeeit storm.</p>

<p>So what does this mean? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oyh35n/gamestops_lead_nft_designer_on_twitter/">Well GameStops lead ETH designer tweeted.</a> EIP-1559 aims to improve Ethereum’s gas fee market by introducing a base fee, meaning wallet providers and users will know the price of a transaction in advance (previously, users had to enter a gas fee bid to miners, meaning many would overpay or underpay to add their transactions to the next block).

<p>Who knows if it ties to the post the other day although that number is now right at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oyv5q1/199k_transferred_through_the_ethereum_address/">7.7M coins at 0.0001 value each</a>. This is right at the 7.6m shares. I can't recall but doesn't GameStop owe someone stock as well? Could that put us at the 7.7M number? Nothing is confirmed. Stay skeptical until we have something concrete.</p>

<p>This one is a few days old but I missed it initially. Some wild calculations. A ton of data with a splash of crude humor. (Sorry to my editor but I am trying to keep the parent at least family friendly so no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhvCSLT0L0w">McGoogles</a> in the post today).</p>
<p>There is also some fuckery happening at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oyl0xu/four_decimal_points_aint_enough_do_i_hear_six/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">SIXTH DECIMAL PLACE.</a> Why is this weird? Well first off if you can find me any 10\^-x iteration of a $0.01 where I have a coin I will eat a balanced breakfast. Second, if sold in a batch of 100 shares, the price would come out to $XX,XXX.XX Now I don't know about you but that would imply a price in the thousands.</p>

<p>SPAC crackdowns are directly related and impacting MMs and Hedgefunds like Citadel. Ken Griffin has a company called Pine Island Capital Partners and Pine Island Acquisition Company. Pine Island got delisted in May by the SEC for financial filings and misrepresentation of their warrants . Pine Island also bragged about being able to profit off of Covid.</p>

<h1><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oyeimk/wolverine_securities_fukd/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">Wolverine is Dead?</a></h1>
<p>Wolverine Securities LLC has a 1.3 million put options in GME and possibly exploded.  Bloomberg Terminal data from 8/4/2021, Wolverine Trading owns 13,843 put options but their 13F says 1,384,300. Weird it’s off by a factor of 100. However, the “top” put owner Simplex’s \~80,000 puts is accurate to their most recent 13F. Weird stuff y’all another “glitch”?</p>
