<p>Every time Steve Cohen or Point72 gets brought up, thereâ€™s a new wave of FUD or Outrage that springs up. </p>
<p>As soon as someone found the Point72 Link to Crypto, Coindesk and grayscale, Vegas victim outrage was the big distraction.</p>
<p>This has happened the last 2-3 times anyone has done any digging into P72. I get the feeling there may be more to uncover.</p>
