<p>FUD right now is out of control but a lot of us can hang in there because we can still pay a bill or two. If we quit our jobs and SHFs find a way to prevent MOASS for a few more months while we are broke then we will experience extreme doubt and psychological warfare.
DON'T QUIT YOUR JOBS YET.</p>
