I'm sure quite a few people are wondering why we are seeing such low volume as of late - While it's true that GME generally has low volume in July (see July 2020), The overall higher retail interest should theoretically fix that. I will go over why this might be happening and how 005 may be impacting the overall volume.

So a few points to get out there:

**What is DTCC-005 meant to do?**

While working as intended, a share that is borrowed will be marked as such and can only be lent out one time.

**How does this effect volume?**

Previously, SHFs would do the following:

- For example purposes, There are 300K shares available to borrow.

- SHF1 will borrow 150K, SHF2 will borrow 150k. SHF1 will sell the 150k shares while SHF2 attempts to purchase the same 150K shares.
- SHF2 will now use a portion of these 150K shares to cover their shares for apes in the dark pools and return the remaining
- Now SHF2 repeats the process back to SHF1.

So what does this accomplish?

SHFs are able to effectively use a pool of 300K borrowable shares to short effectively infinitely by abusing pricing and HFTs. They are able to sell in such a way that the price is continually hammered down. 

**Now here is where 005 comes in to stop that:**
When SHF1 borrows those 150,000 shares they are now marked - When SHF2 buys and then attempts to return a portion of their shares, they no longer go back in to the lending pool as they are marked already.

**So then how are they lowering the price?**

It appears that daily ITM/ATM put purchases have skyrocketed since DTCC-005 was enforced, which would then have the market makers who write the contracts sell shares to hedge - Effectively we are beginning to see a market that is only trading synthetics. As more ITM/ATM puts are being purchased intra-day vs calls, the selling pressure from hedging those puts will show in the intraday price action.

Now, You have probably looked at the option chain and seen the fact that there are more calls than puts on most expiries that weren't a major quarterly option date. You would think that the price should go up but the issue comes in when these contracts were opened - We are seeing (for the most part) more daily puts purchased than calls but more calls being opened a fair while in the past. These calls were already likely hedged for some time OR they were sold as covered calls from retail.

**Things that should occur if this post has the situation correct:**

- We will begin to either see FTD numbers begin to shoot up from when 005 was enforced OR see buy/write trades as outlined by /u/criand start up once more.

- Borrowable shares will bottom out as they can no longer be lent infinitely


~~Now funny I should mention that whole buy/write business above - Today (22/07/21) we had a bunch of deep ITM calls seemingly purchased and immediately executed (see https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/opn3nf/25000000_in_deep_in_the_money_calls_purchased/)~~
This post is debunked but the theory still has some legs until FTD numbers are published.

If you have understood what was happening prior to 005, you can probably see that the SHFs could have, at any time, dropped the price to basically nothing. Retail isn't really buying a huge amount of shares a week as most Apes are tapped out and the ones that are buying every paycheck can only buy so many at the current price. The reason the price remains between 160-190 so often is likely because their models have probably shown that this is the price that will have low enough buy pressure whilst not being high enough to risk more FOMO buying.

**TL;DR**

This continuous extreme low volume is likely an impact of DTCC-005 actively being enforced. If true, we should see buy/write trades as detailed by criand begin again for the first time since march or the published FTD numbers begin to skyrocket as we begin to trade almost exclusively in pure naked shares sold by Market makers to hedge for intraday purchases of FDs in the form of ATM/ITM puts.

**Edit 1:** to add to the tl;dr, new DTCC rulings have probably made hiding FTDs more difficult in general - probably why they are reluctant to trade more synthetics than necessary. It's easy to hide the actual SI% as you can just lie.
