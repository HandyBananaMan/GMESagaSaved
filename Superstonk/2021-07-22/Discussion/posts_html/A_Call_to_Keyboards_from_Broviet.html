<p>I apologize ahead of time for the impending wall of text. I don't have any pictures or particularly flowery prose for y'all this time around. But I simply couldn't wait another moment to lay down some thoughts after reading /u/backrow29's recent post, which can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ope2t6/when_you_think_you_are_at_the_head_of_the_snake/">HERE</a>. If you haven't read it yet, go do so. And upvote. I'll wait.....</p>
<p>Nothing else I've read lately has elicited such an emotional response from me, but especially in such a positive way. Amidst all the shill-driven FUD about automod/satori and the continued blatant and egregious market manipulation and fraud, we're now seeing evidence of hedgies/shills using LV shooting victims' personas in posts about GME or poppitycorno stock. That and a number of other tidbits are driving people into a frothing rage.</p>
<p>I don't blame you. Rightfully so. You know my story, this is just more of the same. If even I am at wits end, I can't imagine how many of you must be feeling. But that anger must be channeled into good. This is but the first battle, and it is not the time to lash out in anger. That is what they want. They want to be able to label you as delusional or unstable. They want to hypocritically hide behind their own extreme version of horrific violence while branding you yourselves as violent. Insanity, I know. But if you want to win, you have to beat them at their own game. We're currently doing that right now in the market, but that's only half the battle.</p>
<p>Yes, the pen is mightier than the sword, but only if you know what to write. They use mainstream media to paint themselves in a favorable light and us in a poor one. Thankfully, mainstream media is 99% imbeciles, because we now have to fight just as hard on that battleground. The reason why they got away with this shit in 2008 and prior is because we weren't unified. We didn't have exceptional researchers, psychologists, and journalists capable of beating these fools at their own game. Twice.</p>
<p>Now? Oh we most certainly do. This is our Declaration of Independence, ladies and gentlemen. If we're going to win this trade, if we're going to change the world, we have to deliver a clear, concise, and comprehensible narrative to the general public about just who it is we're up against. Don't get it twisted, I LOVE me a good KennyG or Steve meme/shitpost, but they largely accomplish nothing. I certainly don't want them to go away, and if that's your forte, more power to you.</p>
<p>This is my Call to Keyboards. You've seen boundless evidence from the community about just how deplorable ALL of these sociopaths are, and the lengths they'll go to mercilessly fleece every one of your friends, family members, and colleagues. As /u/backrow29 said, they don't give a single, solitary fuck about any one of us, and if we don't stop this now, we may never. So Keep. Fucking. Digging. All must fall.</p>
<p>I implore every one of you with a penchant for research, journalism, psychology, any of you comfortable compiling and sharing everything we possibly can about these assclowns, to get on it. You've seen the charts. We may trade sideways for a hot minute, so let's make the best use of our time. No more bickering amongst ourselves. Leave that to the shills. Let's get out there and get shit done. We can't leave it to Michael Lewis to save us with a book and a movie years down the line. This has to be in real time. And it has to be compelling and groundbreaking. And it can't be broad strokes. John Q Public needs to know who to hate, and more importantly, every reason why. Thankfully, that's our mother fucking wheelhouse.....don't you think? üòâ</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: We're winning our away game, but that's only half the battle. Thankfully, this one's in our house. They're on our fucking turf now. If this is a battle for hearts and minds on the internet? I like our fucking odds, but only if we stop being complacent. Not even 2000% short is enough when the rules don't matter. So let's make them. The general public must be educated about the system if we are to change it after the Greatest Depression hits. Goosfraba, y'all. Channel that rage onto the page.</strong></p>
