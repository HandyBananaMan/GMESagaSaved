TDLR: They are all in this together. It is a class war. The water is so deep and murky it makes the everyday person’s head and heart hurt. They made a bad bet. This is the first time they can really lose. They do not see you as an equal. Realize you are up against people that do not care about humanity. Buy and hodl. Be greedier than you can fathom. And tear their house of cards down. 

Morning Coffee...

Back in February, I tried to help people grasp the magnitude of what a POS Steven Cohen is from first hand knowledge and interactions with SAC professionally, but it was dismissed. Cohen is a bigger issue than Kenny yes, but he isn’t even the head of the snake. This is how corporate raiders like Soros, Icahn, Ackman, and Cooperman, to name a few, work. 

As an aside for additional morning coffee chat: If you see GS on a deal, know it is snake oil. Every time I have been in that building I have felt like I need to go directly to a church. Ask yourself why every major politician regardless of party or country has some connection to at least one of the big banks ie GS, Deutsche, JP Morgan, BAC, Mitsubishi, Citi, BNP, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse, Barclays, TD Bank, RBC, HSBC, ICIB. And how they all become so rich so quick and suddenly have foundations and NGOs. And no one goes to jail. 

In the SAC days, they were the middle management hedge fund. The scary, smart, public facing front man that let a hunted company know they were a corporate raider target. The process started with a bunch of small hedge funds that piled on to short companies into distress. Then like a pack of hyenas, SAC starts demanding the company make changes and announces a short position. They create negative media buzz and destroy any value proposition the company has and attempts to articulate to combat the Wall Street paid media machine. 

Suddenly, CNBC shows, Wall Street Journal, and rags like the mOtley fOlL are writing piece after piece and only call the company once the story or segment is public seeking comment. More gotcha. Long positions and retail get scared when the stock price drops from the short selling and FUD cycle. None of it is based on fundamentals.

Once they have the company in the kill box, the big fish who backed it all, finally announced their position…in our case it was Carl Icahn. He feeds like a vampire on companies that would otherwise have continued on and does it in the name of shareholder value. He takes seats on the board, tears the company apart and sells it for parts. Destroys jobs, shareholder value, reputations and lives, for sport. He takes pride in ruining everything in his path. He has never built or created anything. And it is all for power and money. 

I can’t begin to describe the personal attacks that come from these people. They have no conscience. They are weak minded with a wretched soul, spew nothing but venom, yet have skin so thin you could pierce it with a mean tweet or an off comment. They are the kid no one liked growing up. 

I digress. I apologize, it is emotional to discuss knowing what I have seen and been through at their hands. 

The situation companies find themselves in are 100% manipulated and created by people like Icahn and his army of greedy, money hungry psychopaths. Icahn and raiders like him have been doing this on a massive scale since the 70s and peaked in the 80s. Then when his reputation and actions became that of legend, he switched to a man behind the curtain role, but he has always been there pulling the strings for decades. 

He and his ilk are above the law, above government, above prosecution and anyone that they still deem as helpful is also. There are dozens of these types of men around the world, some even bigger than Icahn. People do not know their names. They do not appear on lists. Their wealth and power is what conspiracies are grounded in. And why average people dismiss them. The general public cannot begin to grasp these people live in a different world on the same planet. They are not bound by anything. They do not lose…until now. An overreach greedy mistake with unlimited risk. 

The reality though is that the entire financial system including central banks and Cartels like the Fed, were built by these people for two purposes: power and control both of which come from wealth. Remember the Fed is not a government entity. It is a membership of banks that manages money flow for banks, so basically itself. It is all a centralized control system from those that do not work to control the labor that does work and creates the wealth. This is why small business has been under attack for the last 18 months. Small business had too much decentralized power in the last four years.

The short sale into distressed company is a game they have played many times successfully, until now. It is why none of the DD is debunked. Because it is a nightmare the average person stumbled upon. Make no mistake retail has no friends in this. Only a few whales that want to feast on other whales and get a little good PR. 

I myself do not need more convincing or DD. I will wait and wait and hodl and hodl until there is big boy financial bleeding not just Kenny and Stevie and their merry band jesters losing billions.

Edit: I am overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you so much for listening to my morning mussing and reflections over coffee. I lurk a lot. This community is a gift. Retail investors are so fortunate to have a safe place and a voice.
