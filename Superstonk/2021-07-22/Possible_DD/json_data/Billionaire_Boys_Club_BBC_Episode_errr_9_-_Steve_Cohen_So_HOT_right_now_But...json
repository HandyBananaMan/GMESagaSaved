I work in Digital Marketing... and believe me when I tell you this... his website did NOT cost $402,563!!\n\nI mean sure... it's got some fancy animations, but it's a Wordpress site with a Pro Theme... That's it!\n\nOh... but maybe he's spending that amount on Marketing his website? \n\nNope... he's got a separate line item for that... Content... nope... hosting? He gets fuck all traffic so **NOPE!**\n\nNow... I don't take this lightly...\n\nYou could say maybe he's spending on SEO... buying Backlinks... **SOMETHING**...\n\nHere's his SEMrush report:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le0lsi5c1tc71.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=f471ae6d98614bc5f95cfa3d1560054b5e80a14f\n\nFair enough... he's got a decent authority score... but he's not even running ads... \n\nHe gets 10k hits a month... and that only increased in the last year...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psbdez3i1tc71.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=36c3c352015c5f147991b42d7dcd881e40bb6964\n\nIf he is paying $400k for these results... he is either **GETTING RIPPED OFF** by some **SLICK** sales Digital Marketer... or he's **REALLY BAD** at running a business...\n\nNeither makes sense... **SO>>> LIES!**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarketing... \n\n2019 - He spent 600k... **BUT HE'S NOT RUNNING ADS?**\n\nYou may say... maybe he did in 2019?\n\nIf he did... he'd have more than just Google Analytics tracking on his website so he can actually see the results of his $600k in marketing right? \n\nWell if you know how to read HTML you can go in and verify that all he has is Analytics: view-source:[https://www.steveandalex.org/](https://www.steveandalex.org/)\n\nBut **ANYWAY**... I suppose he can argue that he is using it for PR... not **MARKETING**... or some bullshit...\n\n**FUCK**...

The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation received a total of $2,088 in donations\n\n**(FUCK... that $600k in Marketing went a LONG way didn't it!!>>>>???)**\n\nBUT...\n\nThey made $99,000,000 in **DIVIDENDS...**\n\n(Fuck me... that's a lot!)\n\nAnd they gave out $101 million in donations. \n\nNow... the **BEST** dividend rate from stock in the market right now is Gilead Sciences at 4.12%...\n\nSo if his entire fund was in Gilead, that $99 million would mean his fund must be...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fkiufjk45tc71.gif\n\n**$2,402,912,621**\n\nBut... his **ACTUAL** investment **BOOK VALUE** is **$515,813,195** or **Market Value** of **$693,523,715**\n\nHmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n\nOk... Maybe he has preferred shares? \n\nAccording to Forbes ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2021/01/17/the-best-preferred-stocks-for-2021/?sh=7f50466c75d7)) in 2021 the highest yielding Preferred Shares are Jon Hancock Premium Dividend Fund... at 8.6%...\n\nSo **MATH...**\n\nWould still put the fund requirement at **$1,151,162,790**...\n\nI honestly don't know here Apes...\n\nThis seems suspect to me. \n\nHe's getting a 19% yield on **DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST???**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99ig33ca7tc71.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c240cbf07b13dd2b7780e6afdc241acb0ac20f4\n\nAny Finance Apes care to enlighten us? \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Ahh... wait... Now I SEE!!!**\n\nHe's invested his charity's money through **Point72 Capital INTL II LTD!!!**\n\nHow did I not think of that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pw09j1gy7tc71.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=73a8fca24d3f16fd2b86fb151dfa1f5d36ad8c42\n\nSo he MUST be getting crazy returns for his clients then too right?\n\nHmmmm....\n\nAccording to this article... [Source](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1k9dx9x1pt8wx/Steve-Cohen-Pulled-Down-at-Least-1-3-Billion-in-2019)\n\nStevey in 2019 returned 14.9% for clients **NET OF FEES...**\n\nBut charges 2.85% Fees....\n\nSo... Lets see here...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7w7q0ct59tc71.gif\n\n**14.9% + 2.85% = 17.75%**\n\nBut...\n\nHis charity generated **19.1% returns...**\n\n**That's a 1.35% difference...**\n\nTHIS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH... BUT IN THIS WORLD... IT'S A FUCK TON...\n\nNo accusations... \n\n**BUT IS STEVEY CUTTING A BIT OFF THE TOP OF HIS CLIENTS MONEY?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7g6rldnektc71.png?width=160&format=png&auto=webp&s=5189d348cfdd1049385e2c118b02a22b1b18fb28\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo let's take a look at what he's spending these **HARD-EARNED** gains on then, shall we?\n\nRemember our BBC Benefits Category Guide? \n\n# TAKE FROM THE RICH AND GIVE TO THE RICH THROUGH THESE CATEGORIES:\n\n**Charter Schools** \\- Control The Education System while making your friends rich\n\n**Elite Colleges** \\- Get your Kids into the best schools while making your friends rich\n\n**Healthcare** \\- Ensure those that can afford healthcare get the best while making your friends rich\n\n**Religions** \\- Make sure your image is upheld in your community while making your friends rich\n\n**Art** \\- Buy nice tax havens while making your friends rich\n\n**Political Parties** \\- Make sure your friends control the laws, keep the pesky poor in their place... while making your friends rich.\n\n**THE KEY BEING...

Right?\n\nSo in 2018... **an article in ProPublica found that The Cohen Network was closing it's clinic in Los Angeles less than a year after it opened. The Cohen Network's leaders had alienated the staff there, former employees said, by telling them to prioritize healthier patients over homeless veterans.**\n\nThis is **SPECULATED** as the privatization of Mental Health Treatment for VAs in America... and I'm **GUESSING** many of you already know all about this... **RIGHT??**\n\nThe article continues with:\n\nA thorough examination of the Cohen Network\u2019s record \u2014\u00a0including internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews with current and former employees \u2014 reveals a different story from the one the Cohen Network tells about itself. \n\nThe clinic at the University of Southern California **(Also on the above Donation list)** was doomed by the Cohen Network\u2019s mismanagement and insistence on a narrow focus that helped only a subset of veterans, former employees said. \n\n\u201cThe model we ended up believing would really serve veterans was different than the model the Cohen Network was proposing all clinics operate under,\u201d said Marv Southard, who served as CEO of the Cohen clinic at USC and is now chair of USC\u2019s doctor of social work program. \n\nThere's a lot more to read in here for any Apes that are interested.\n\n[Source](https://www.propublica.org/article/steve-cohen-privatized-ptsd-veterans-clinic)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn a 2016 NYTimes article... Cohen is quoted as saying that:\n\n With veterans, Mr. Cohen makes clear that this is his project alone, separate from the charitable work his family foundation has done under the oversight of his wife, Alexandra. (Their family foundation, which gives away about $50 million a year, has focused on causes like children\u2019s health and Lyme disease.) \n\n[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/giving/disgraced-hedge-fund-manager-focuses-on-aiding-veterans.html)\n\n\\-- So he's **SAYING** that his foundation is not involved in the Cohen Network... YA?\n\nWell I had a look...\n\nIn 2016, the time of this article... the foundation donated $10,500,000 to the Cohen Veterans Network...\n\n# More Lies? \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDam I **BADLY** need a puppy break!!\n\nCUPPIE #2 ... Awww.... aren't you the CUTEST puppy in a cup I've ever seen>????\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngblm7g5buc71.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a5b72ade9a57acfe560440abb31c22ea322b28d\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell I thought to myself...\n\nOk... BADASSTRADER...\n\nThink this through...\n\nThe Cohen Foundation, Invests their $500 million in Point 72... Gets the VIP returns rate of 19.1%... then uses these profits to donate to causes that further his agenda...\n\nBut it costs him nothing... ok...\n\nWell $47 million goes to the Cohen Veterans Network... \n\nLet's take a look at that company right???\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell taking a look at the Cohen Veterans Network... 2018 (2019 not available yet)\n\nThe **MAIN** donor is Cohen's Foundation... this is expected...\n\nHe pays out Salaries to senior staff in the 6 figures... ok...\n\nSpends $1.6 million on Marketing... hmmm\n\nWebsite and Client Portal costs $29k.... **(Pfff ha ha ha ha!) - Remember how much he spent on his funds website... BULLSHIT!!!**\n\nAnd then most of the rest gets donated out to the individual Military Family Clinics...\n\nNow... I had a look at these Military Family Clinics... and these all look to be the real deal.\n\nGovernment-funded initiatives with the sole purpose of helping vets and their families...\n\nSo what was the story with CVN here? \n\nCohen has his clinics listed at these Military Family Clinics around the country...\n\nIt **SEEMS** like...\n\nHe donates to the Military Family Clinic, provides a grant to get his own team in there and set them up... then funds the team and trains them to provide care using their **UNIQUE** methods...\n\nCould be completely wrong... but...\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe did say that: Mr. Cohen makes clear that this is his project alone...\n\nThough it **SEEMS** that he just takes a portion of his profits... Hires a team of execs... gets them to donate to Family Clinics around the country and has smaller teams installed along side them...\n\nHmmm............\n\nThough the Military Family Clinics he is partnering are **WAY** more funded, have **WAY** more staff... and seem to be doing a good job from the outside looking in...\n\nMaybe it's nothing... but I wanted to get some independent reviews of this place. \n\nIf he's in all these clinics around the country, shouldn't there be some feedback besides the fact that they are de-prioritising homeless vets? \n\nI took a look at their facebook page: [Source](https://www.facebook.com/cohenveteransnetwork/)\n\nOut of the last 24 posts... not 1 comment... \n\nHMMM..... that's weird. \n\nThen they went live back in June 28th... and they got 2 comments saying they were great...\n\nLets keep digging...\n\nAnother 9 posts with 0 comments...\n\nLots of likes no comments...\n\nThen again a live stream and they had 2 people commenting...\n\nLets dig again...\n\nFinally a REAL comment back in June 16, but not about CVN\n\nToo many posts not enough real engagement...\n\nGlassDoor says its an amazing place to work [source](https://www.glassdoor.ie/Overview/Working-at-Cohen-Veterans-Network-EI_IE1159646.11,33.htm?countryRedirect=true)\n\nUrrgghhh....\n\nNot finding anything **REAL** here...\n\nSame story on [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cohenveterans/)\n\nSame Story on [YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUxi9F6jP2c&ab_channel=CohenVeteransNetwork)\n\nSame Story on [REDDIT](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=cohen%20veterans%20network) (Shocking - 0 comments)\n\nI scoured the Internet Apes...\n\nI really did...\n\nCohen has committed to $235 million in funding for this program... and I can see the money going through Salaries and Donations to Military Family Clinics... but if they are helping all these people how come **NO INDEPENDENT** reviews **GOOD** or **BAD** are talking about it? \n\nAll I can find is **POOR** efforts at Social Content by their Social Media team... news reports and a few staff stating how great it is to work there. \n\nI want to be wrong here... I want it to be a great service doing great things...\n\nBut it seems to be invisible... at least from a Digital Perspective. \n\nThey are running ads and there is a **LITTLE** bit of traffic going to the site\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs6mmr1u7uc71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8d1ca566b06914648140d344069fec125030f75\n\nBut that's it...
