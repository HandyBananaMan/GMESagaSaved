    "selftext": "This is psychological marketing.  These accounts exist to do one thing:  get you to interact with them and post about them. \n\nBut why would somebody do such a hateful and horrible thing? You might ask yourself.  \n\nHere's why.  And I'm just going to use a made up story.  \n\nLet's suppose Johnny just graduated high school and got $1,000 in graduation money.  He hangs out on twitter and reddit and sees that buying stocks is all the rage.  He opens up a RH account and buys whatever the meme stock of the day is.  Pretty soon he loses all his money and he's done.  Easy $1k for the MMs and broker. \n\n\nBut wait, what's happening in the mean time?  He might be on a subreddit that's drawing a ton of attention to the fact that there's shill accounts using dead people's names--not only dead people, but dead people who were horrifically slaughtered in a domestic terrorist attack.  He'd be outraged (as he should be).  But Johnny might also follow each of those accounts on twitter to be the next person on the forefront to \"break the story\" of what these awful accounts are doing (or he might just be curious, who knows).\n\nIf our dear Johnny saw on a subreddit that buying XYZ stock was a good buy from one of these bot accounts before he made his trade and before he found out who they were, he might be influenced to do so in the future.  Now Johnny is disgusted.  He might immediately sell his position or hold it out of spite.  And sometime down the way, long after he's forgotten why he's following certain twitter accounts he may see one of them post \"Whew, I just lost a bunch of money on xyz stock.  Thinking about getting out of it.\"  And another person who he's subscribed to might reply to that account, \"Yah man, I'm not sure this is worth it at this point, I'm gonna bail.\"\n\nAnd you're saying to yourself right now:  \"New_acct_3, that's so fucking stupid.  Who would fall for that, dumbass?\"  Not you.  It's not geared to you.  The entire campaign is geared to get people on the fringes to talk about emotional things and trade based on emotion.  \n\nBeen in this kind of marketing world for a long time.  I hate the acronym FUD, because it's a stupid acronym when better words can be applied, but the reason this was discovered today and talked about en masse is because it's a FUD campaign.  \n\n\nSleep tight and always ask yourself the following:  How does what I'm reading stand to benefit the person/organization that posted it, and why do I care and feel emotionally compelled either positively or negatively.\n\nEdited for a bit of sentence structure and grammar.",
