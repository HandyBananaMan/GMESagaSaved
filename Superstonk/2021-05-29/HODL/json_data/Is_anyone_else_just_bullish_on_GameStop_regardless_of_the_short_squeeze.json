    "selftext": "Why would I sell GME at this price point when GameStop is:\n\n1) Beating Amazon at their own delivery service\n\n2) Expanding their market to more than just video games\n\n3) Reorganizing with a really strong board of directors\n\n4) Converting their retail stores to PC Cafes\n\n5) Made a freaking performance center in Texas - what else are they gonna make? They're also debt free somehow? Good lord\n\n6) Hinted at a esports department with a brand new Twitter account <- maybe fake but jesus christ it made me jack my god damn tits\n\n7) Lastly, nft.gamestop.com anyone?\n\n**The stock is truly undervalued in my honest opinion.**\n\nIf Amazon was just an indie company out of a garage but is now valued at 3.2k - what makes GameStop any different? Seriously, why would you sell even if somehow the short squeeze did not happen? I bet you we'll see the institution have a change in sentiment towards GameStop in the near future irreagrdless of a squeeze or not.\n\nTL;DR: GameStop is about to be the new G in FAANG. Hedgies are fukt. HODL.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Alright, I'm glad this is well known lol and we have similar sentiments :) - I just see apes on this subreddit come and go and I'm not sure who read what.\n\n\nI guess the last thing I'll say is: If there's ever an alarm of FUD - just recall our sentiment UwU",
