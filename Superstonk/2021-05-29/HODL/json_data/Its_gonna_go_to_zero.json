    "selftext": "First off, I never discuss my holdings with anyone I run into. Well today I was at a wedding with my wife and we were talking to another couple. The gentleman explains how he is super in the red in his crypto holdings while I smile and nod. My wife mentioned to him that I had some of our favorite stock. He immediately says \"Oh youre gonna sell right?\". I said no and tried to blow it off and he continues with \"You agree its gonna go to zero right?\"\n\nI replied that I disagreed but thanks. He persisted with a smirk and \"Yeah but you agree its gonna go to zero when the joke is over? Like the business isnt going to last\". I gave the same simple response and we were able to mingle our way to some other friends nearby when his wife pulled him away for pictures. \n\nI always strive to think critically about things and I strongly believe in this company's future, so to say that it will \"go to zero\" sounds utterly insane and misinformed....especially by an outsider with no skin in the game.\n\nThis interaction showed me further how misinformed the mass public is on this issue, and how much effort the media and institutions are fighting back. This is big.\n\nEdit: Yes this about gme",
