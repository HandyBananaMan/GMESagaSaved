Just did some quick maffs with [https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator#CTxi9T34Ki](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator#CTxi9T34Ki) and after taxes, the $20,000,000 floor would leave you with around $9.4 million. If you're cool with that, that's whats up, but I want my $20,000,000 after taxes, and I want other apes to have it too, so that means the REAL floor is $38,000,000.
