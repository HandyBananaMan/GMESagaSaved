<p>Why would I sell GME at this price point when GameStop is:</p>
<p>1) Beating Amazon at their own delivery service</p>
<p>2) Expanding their market to more than just video games</p>
<p>3) Reorganizing with a really strong board of directors</p>
<p>4) Converting their retail stores to PC Cafes</p>
<p>5) Made a freaking performance center in Texas - what else are they gonna make? They're also debt free somehow? Good lord</p>
<p>6) Hinted at a esports department with a brand new Twitter account &lt;- maybe fake but jesus christ it made me jack my god damn tits</p>
<p>7) Lastly, nft.gamestop.com anyone?</p>
<p><strong>The stock is truly undervalued in my honest opinion.</strong></p>
<p>If Amazon was just an indie company out of a garage but is now valued at 3.2k - what makes GameStop any different? Seriously, why would you sell even if somehow the short squeeze did not happen? I bet you we'll see the institution have a change in sentiment towards GameStop in the near future irreagrdless of a squeeze or not.</p>
<p>TL;DR: GameStop is about to be the new G in FAANG. Hedgies are fukt. HODL.</p>
<p>EDIT: Alright, I'm glad this is well known lol and we have similar sentiments :) - I just see apes on this subreddit come and go and I'm not sure who read what.</p>
<p>I guess the last thing I'll say is: If there's ever an alarm of FUD - just recall our sentiment UwU</p>
