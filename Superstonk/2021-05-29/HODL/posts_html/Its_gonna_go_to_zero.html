<p>First off, I never discuss my holdings with anyone I run into. Well today I was at a wedding with my wife and we were talking to another couple. The gentleman explains how he is super in the red in his crypto holdings while I smile and nod. My wife mentioned to him that I had some of our favorite stock. He immediately says "Oh youre gonna sell right?". I said no and tried to blow it off and he continues with "You agree its gonna go to zero right?"</p>
<p>I replied that I disagreed but thanks. He persisted with a smirk and "Yeah but you agree its gonna go to zero when the joke is over? Like the business isnt going to last". I gave the same simple response and we were able to mingle our way to some other friends nearby when his wife pulled him away for pictures. </p>
<p>I always strive to think critically about things and I strongly believe in this company's future, so to say that it will "go to zero" sounds utterly insane and misinformed....especially by an outsider with no skin in the game.</p>
<p>This interaction showed me further how misinformed the mass public is on this issue, and how much effort the media and institutions are fighting back. This is big.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes this about gme</p>
