<p>Fellow Apes,  </p>
<p>We all know that RC is strategic, very smart and has a passion for cryptic messages. </p>
<p>He knew that if he were to leave a message as odd as the recent one he posted on Twitter, apes would go bananas on it.  </p>
<p>Well, his recent tweet didn’t disappoint.  </p>
<p>RC’s recent tweet: 
RYAN COHEN 
R.I.P. DUMB ASS  </p>
<p>If you look carefully, you’ll see that it may be an anagram. By rearranging the letters, one combination you get is: 
MOASS NEAR. BUY DIP. RCHN.  </p>
<p>After this, it will be impossible to get your tits unjacked! </p>
<p>Next few weeks will be interesting, to say the least.</p>
<p>edit: for clarification, “RCHN” is just his signature, Ryan Cohen</p>
<p>edit 2: it was noted in the comments that the TOMBSTONE may refer to a type of financial print notice. Such notice is most often used in the financial industry to formally announce a particular transaction, such as an initial public offering, merger or acquisition. This leads me to think, potential merger with Super League Gaming announcement coming up!?</p>
<p>edit 3: it was pointed out to me that Super League Gaming (SLGG), from edit 2, may have been used in the past as a speculation maneuver by Citadel as they own shares of it. </p>
<p>So I looked it up and Fintel confirms that not only Citadel owns shares of SLGG, but that they also upped their stake in 2Q21! They went from owning 27.1K shares to 63.2K.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, let’s keep SLGG out of the picture/speculation.</p>
<p>edit 4: several users have proposed the idea that the announcement will be the merger between GameStop and RC Ventures, which already owns 12.9% of GameStop. I really like this theory because it wouldn’t be out of character.</p>
<p>Sep 2020: RC Ventures acquired 10% stake in GME</p>
<p>Nov 2020: RC Ventures sends a spicy, big-D-swinging letter to GameStop’s Board of Director (if you have never read it, do yourself a favor: <a href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf">check it out here</a> and get your tits even more jacked)</p>
<p>Dec 2020: RC Ventures ups its stake in GameStop to 12.9%</p>
<p>Some users added that by increasing its stake to 20% or so, a merger would be the very next step</p>
