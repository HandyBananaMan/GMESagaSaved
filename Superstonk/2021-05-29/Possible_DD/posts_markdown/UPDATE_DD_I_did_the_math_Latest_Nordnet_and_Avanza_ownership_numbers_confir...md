**Update 1st June 2021:**

RIP to my inbox, however I managed to go through all messages and updated my table accordingly, main changes listed here:

\-> (New) T212 total shareholders available

\-> (Updated) eToro numbers. Apparently [96k GME investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/npc9n7/when_you_purchase_gme_on_etoro_it_states_that/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) on eToro !

\-> (Updated) [Selfwealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nm2ts4/52584_unvotable_shares_held_by_aussie_apearoos_in/) total number of GME shareholder available.

I encourage all of you apes to go and ask your broker for data available. Shares per ape, total shares held, total shareholders, it doesn't matter. All data helps.

Hello fellow Apes and welcome to our third and latest episode of:

# 'Who owns the float?!'

I do not only envy the Nordics for their full viking hair and their beautiful lady apes, but apparently also for their damn hot stock brokers!  Why is that?

As we are entering the final stage of *'hedgies are fuk'* Nordnet as well as Avanza (both brokers from the Nordics) seem to genuinley care about their customers *(yea, take a slice of that, RH and all you other dirtbag brokers)* and published their proxy vote stats on [freaking twitter](https://twitter.com/avanzabank/status/1397874363056197633). I will save you the click, just see below:

[Avanza da real MVP](https://preview.redd.it/tf4bipjy72271.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fddc9801512944036343aad59e7a9fb011aa61e)

[shut up and take my money Axel, much love.](https://preview.redd.it/dprsjl2v72271.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cd18f6db9e42fd4761058a3968aa84ae112503f)

Btw: I heard transparency is a thing in the Nordics, is it true that you can just look up your neighbours tax statements or is that just a myth?

However, lets look into the numbers. In my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxrdcb/updated_dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no/) I made some assumptions, and the by far most critical was: How many shares does the average GME investor hold? **Avanza / Nordnet are answering exactly this question.**

Quick math:

|Broker|Total GME Apes|Total Shares held|Average Shares / Apes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Avanza*|*22,023*|*322,545*|*14.65*|
|*Nordnet*|*19,206*|*329,812*|*17.17*|
|**Total**|**41,229**|**652,357**|**15.82**|

**15.82 / Shares per ape. If that doesnt sound juicy, i dont know what does. And even better, it exactly matches with my assumptions from my initial post:**

[tbh, i am suprised myself how accurate my guesstimate was](https://preview.redd.it/t0o9jy9r72271.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ed5445631d928f0ba7d48213c2ea6972d5604f)

Okay - with the new numbers being fresh in, lets update our sweet little table. I will narrow it to down to 15 / 17.5 / 20 shares per ape. I believe that especially our US apes hold a little more than the Nordics, just for the plain reason that GameStop is more present in the States. (it even appears that GameStop has [left the Nordic market completely](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/dq2pkm/gamestop_is_closing_all_stores_in_the_nordic/). Any viking ape here to confirm this?).

Please see the updated table below:

[assumptions as of 1st June 2021](https://preview.redd.it/uqd99jb1pn271.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd3e5f49808af4deff5a4d5023ad5fecc8298bfc)

Yep, you read that right: 173% up to 230% of remaining float seems to be in retails hand. And as you can see, my list is **by far not complete** (just think of all the regular banks that offer trading accounts).

Just some more hyping:

[April was a completly sideways crab-walk-month and the volume was nearly non-existent at some point. However even under these circumstances our favorite stock managed to reach #1 in many major european markets!](https://preview.redd.it/oc72s0sh72271.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2a1b6c066c2e7e32dd5a4be003628afddc5a2b3)

Hold strong my fellow apes, it is the final stage we have entered ! Sorting out the last paper hands before entering lightspeed. And as always: **If in doubt, zoom out**:

[if in doubt, zoom out](https://preview.redd.it/iaebf1jg72271.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fab1ab6efe4e9750455a8c87f512b48fd4f5620)

Have a great weekend, see you on market open, cheers !  ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
