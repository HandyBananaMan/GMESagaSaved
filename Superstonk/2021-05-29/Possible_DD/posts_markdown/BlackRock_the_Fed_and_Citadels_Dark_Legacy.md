APES. So my post last night in u/CuriousCatNYC777's post was taken down by automod because I edited it and that took it over the character limit. Lol smooth brain. My first comment that blows up and that happens. Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nneg7p/european_financial_news_is_reporting_that_hedge/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nneg7p/european_financial_news_is_reporting_that_hedge/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb) I have messaged the mods to ask it be brought back, but in the meantime putting it out there for those that want to see it.


Ok this has got my mind going in a million directions. Obviously this has connections with The Everything Short - the idea that Citadel found an infinite money glitch that involves shorting the entire US Treasury Bond market and completely screwing over the repo market in the process.

It always made sense to me that the Fed would want to stop Citadel, to cut them out of the system like a cancer before they mess things up real good. But it always seemed too good to be true. We don't want to fall into the trap of assuming that everything relates to GME. Why would the Fed give two deuces about us?

And then this journalist - from another country, of course nobody in America would pick up on this - ties the two together perfectly. And if you have any doubts, take a look at [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/how-larry-fink-s-blackrock-is-helping-the-fed-with-bond-buying). Guess who has a history of helping the Fed out with this kind of thing? So much so that some people refer to them as the fourth branch of the government? Oh that's right. BLACKROCK.

BOOM folks, the final piece clicks into place. Bring your cameras because we're not even stopping on the moon, we're going straight for Alpha Centauri.

Just to recap in case I didn't make it clear enough last night in my excitement, BlackRock - yes, BLACKROCK, the largest institutional holder of GME by a massive margin, who has a history of backing Daddy Ryan Cohen, and who is the #1 candidate to be the mythical GME Long Whale that is bleeding Citadel dry - ALSO has a history of helping the Fed buy bonds (which Citadel has shorted into oblivion - see u/atobitt's The Everything Short) and disposing of toxic assets in the wake of a financial crisis (see the articke I posted, here's the url: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/how-larry-fink-s-blackrock-is-helping-the-fed-with-bond-buying).

This article OP posted confirms it, the Fed has enlisted the help of certain banks and financial institutions to avert or mitigate the effects of an incoming financial crisis. I would bet an entire GME share at peak MOASS price that BlackRock is helping the Fed accomplish this by deleting Citadel out of existence, before they can screw over the US Treasury bond and repo markets any more. And how are they going to do that? GME go üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Strap in lads and lassies, it isn't just us vs. Citadel. It's us, BlackRock and the Fed vs Citadel. The government isn't going to step in and stop the MOASS from happening - THEY WANT IT TO HAPPEN. Now, this means they can also manipulate the price so that it doesn't happen until they are good and ready. We have seen this with all the rules passed recently. But there is going to be fireworks. This is like Megalodon vs. Kraken of the financial world. And we are all little fishes in the sea (what kind of fish most resembles an ape?). We will need to have patience, it might not happen exactly when we think (personally I am still jacqued for the next 6-7 weeks). But we are going to have the feast of a lifetime when it all shakes out.

Not financial advice, I literally can't distinguish my behind from a coconut, fyi. Oh look, a banana!
