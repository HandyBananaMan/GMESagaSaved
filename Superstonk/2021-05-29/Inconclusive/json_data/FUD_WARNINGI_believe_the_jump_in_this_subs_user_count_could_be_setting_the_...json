I had no idea how many online users were on the sub until these posts started showing up and I'll bet that was the case with others.\n\n**I think they are going to pump and dump the sub.**\n\n**First** \\- artificially inflate subs user numbers. I don't think these are bots, I think they are just empty user accounts to make the sub count look larger. If they are bots they could just be sitting \"online\" to boost the online user count.\n\n**Second** \\- Have shill accounts post over and over referencing sub count.\n\n**Third** \\- Have your army of empty user accounts unsub and fake an exodus, possibly corresponding with a massive fud campaign. Making it look like the user base is upset and giving up. **Possibly with a new sub destination**.(u/Jabarumba)\n\nWe have seen in the past that FUD increases on the weekends.\n\nSo be alert.\n\nWe know what to do.
