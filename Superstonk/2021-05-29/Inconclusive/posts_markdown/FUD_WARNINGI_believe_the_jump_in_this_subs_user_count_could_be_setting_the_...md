I've been suspicious of the online sub count from the moment it was being referenced frequently. I had no idea how many online users were on the sub until these posts started showing up and I'll bet that was the case with others.

**I think they are going to pump and dump the sub.**

**First** \- artificially inflate subs user numbers. I don't think these are bots, I think they are just empty user accounts to make the sub count look larger. If they are bots they could just be sitting "online" to boost the online user count.

**Second** \- Have shill accounts post over and over referencing sub count.

**Third** \- Have your army of empty user accounts unsub and fake an exodus, possibly corresponding with a massive fud campaign. Making it look like the user base is upset and giving up. **Possibly with a new sub destination**.(u/Jabarumba)

We have seen in the past that FUD increases on the weekends.

So be alert.

We know what to do. The subs numbers are moot.

WE **BUY**.

WE **HODL**.

WE **VOTE**.

WE WILL WIN.

Edit: Formatting

Edit 2: Added cointel pro link.

Edit 3: Added u/Jabarumba's comment

Edit 4: I don't think this necessarily requires any action to be taken by us or the mods. **Remember what was said before**: any "call to action" or any statement of urgency, **other then to vote**, is most likely misdirection. This post was only to draw attention to the sub count and the possibility of it being a shill tactic.

Edit 5: edited wording for clarity.
