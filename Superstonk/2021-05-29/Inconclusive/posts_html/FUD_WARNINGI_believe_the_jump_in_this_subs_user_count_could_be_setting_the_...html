<p>I've been suspicious of the online sub count from the moment it was being referenced frequently. I had no idea how many online users were on the sub until these posts started showing up and I'll bet that was the case with others.</p>
<p><strong>I think they are going to pump and dump the sub.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First</strong> - artificially inflate subs user numbers. I don't think these are bots, I think they are just empty user accounts to make the sub count look larger. If they are bots they could just be sitting "online" to boost the online user count.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong> - Have shill accounts post over and over referencing sub count.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong> - Have your army of empty user accounts unsub and fake an exodus, possibly corresponding with a massive fud campaign. Making it look like the user base is upset and giving up. <strong>Possibly with a new sub destination</strong>.(u/Jabarumba)</p>
<p>We have seen in the past that FUD increases on the weekends.</p>
<p>So be alert.</p>
<p>We know what to do. The subs numbers are moot.</p>
<p>WE <strong>BUY</strong>.</p>
<p>WE <strong>HODL</strong>.</p>
<p>WE <strong>VOTE</strong>.</p>
<p>WE WILL WIN.</p>

<p>Edit: Formatting</p>
<p>Edit 2: Added cointel pro link.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Added u/Jabarumba's comment</p>
<p>Edit 4: I don't think this necessarily requires any action to be taken by us or the mods. <strong>Remember what was said before</strong>: any "call to action" or any statement of urgency, <strong>other then to vote</strong>, is most likely misdirection. This post was only to draw attention to the sub count and the possibility of it being a shill tactic.</p>
<p>Edit 5: edited wording for clarity.</p>
