<p>Hi apes, ex-cyber ops ape here (mods if you want them receipts, I can provide them). I saw this post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nnnb8e/fud_warningi_believe_the_jump_in_this_subs_user/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nnnb8e/fud_warningi_believe_the_jump_in_this_subs_user/</a> referencing the recent massive increase in online users. Since I've been trained in what I think is a relevant field, I want to try to give you apes a few data points and tools to both help your harden your minds against any attacks that may be leveled, or are being leveled against the sub, and decrease the performance of any automated systems that may be interacting with us. I've got a few ideas that could throw a wrench into any AIs trying to make sense of what is already a beautiful mess of mass data. &lt;3 :)</p>
<p>So, when I went through training, they trained us in batches. We had us operators and our leaders complete the same pipeline. Now, as a technically focused individual, I didn't pay much attention to the leadership/legal parts of the course (cuz ugh, boring, let me get my hands on-keyboard). I actually almost failed the legal portion of the class lol. That being said, if there are any apes in here familiar with what I'm about to cover, please pipe up and I'll eddit and creddit accordingly.</p>
<p>When one plans any op, cyber or otherwise, you set out with goals. Now, that's obvious, but for any ape who hasn't broken it down themselves yet, after the op, there's a review of how things went, what worked, what didn't. In the class I went through, we called the metrics we used to measure how good we did MOEs (Measures Of Effectiveness) and MOPs (Measures of Performance). Now, this is where my tech focused brain lost track of things, but the point is that when one employs a tactic, you wanna know if that tactic worked well towards your goals (I think this was the MOE). You also want to know at the end, how far did you get toward your goals, (I think this was the MOP, can you see how I was confused yet lol?). Basically one measures how well the tactics used worked individually, and the other measures worked on a sliding scale, how close you got to a perfect 100% of a goal. IMO, these two metrics are going to be tracked, and tactics adjusted accordingly, during any attack that may happen, or be happening, to our community. This is probably tracked programmatically; there are too many apes who each ook according to their own manner for all of us to be followed by a human operator, that would be horrifically expensive....possible, but improbable.</p>
<p>Now, since I think we're all being fed into some beefy AIs for analysis of sentiment/behaviour etc, here's a link to the challenges faced by those that make these systems <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/5-challenges-of-big-data-analytics-in-2021/">https://www.analyticsinsight.net/5-challenges-of-big-data-analytics-in-2021/</a> . I'm going to go through the bullet points and try to relate it to our situation.</p>
<p>Lack of data. There is no lack of data, we're super active, and provide plenty of data for them to both train their AIs, and analyse.</p>
<p>Long data response. This is in their house, if they're on their game, and I think they are, they're probably looking at a lambda feed (this is kind of a cross between periodical updates and real-time analytics). Who knows the answer? The engineers who run the systems looking at us.</p>
<p>Old approaches applied to a new system. This was a challenge for them, we saw it when bots started pumping $SSR etc. However, since that happened, they've realized their error(s), and further tuned their systems. I'd argue that we're dealing with some cutting edge systems purpose built for handling us. While that's a little daunting, it also gives us valuable intel. Since we are the bleeding edge of data to analyse, and the systems doing the analysis are being developed right alongside our behaviour, we can leverage that as a weakness on their end. If we can fuck up the data being fed to these systems, we can mess with their analysis (there'll be some ideas at the end for how we can do this).</p>
<p>Poor quality of source data. IT'S RIGHT THERE FOLKS!!! This is our big up. Since, if I'm correct that our analysis systems are being developed in lock step with us, if we can morph the data into something the machine doesn't understand, we get a few steps ahead. Now, for each and every manoeuvre we make, they'll update their systems to catch back up. However, if we keep adding layers of funk to our behaviour, it becomes more and more computationally expensive for them to process our data. I can smell the money burning already.</p>
<p>System defects related to the data flow. This is what we target by messing with the mass amounts of data they're slurping up. We're aiming to leverage gaps in how they're processing our data. WELCOME TO THE MUD (message un-describable) ZONE.</p>
<p>Messy data visualization: This is on their end, I don't see us affecting this. (bananass man may beg to differ).</p>
<p>The system is over-engineered. So, this happens when the processed data has to go through too many filters or programs, and it delays providing output. This is our GOAL, we want to force them into creating a system that is so interconnected and complicated that it literally can't keep up unless they plug some DNA based quantum supercomputer into it. SHUSH HEDGIES, DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.</p>
<p>Inefficient data organization. This is part on their end, part on our end. We can't affect how they decide to parse what we say and do. What we can do is try to organize the data we provide them in such ways that it *becomes* disorganized on their end. Like I said, I'll provide some ideas I've had to do this at the end, and I'm sure you'll all have some ideas yourselves.</p>
<p>Problems with big data analytics infrastructure and resource utilization. This is another of our big ups. We're trying to melt their silicon here. We want their AWS compute cloud bill to be as big as we can make it. Forcing them to peel through layers of fromunda cheese before they get actionable data costs them.</p>
<p>Outdated technologies. As I've said, I'm pretty sure the AIs analysing us are being built, trained, and developed in lock-step with us. We're a weird dataset.</p>
<p>Non-optimal infrastructure. This is completely on their end. We aren't going to commit cyber crime to break their systems, even tho BAMInvestor got victimized by someone, we play clean.</p>
<p>The system that you have chosen is overengineered. This has been addressed. AnalyticsInsight, check your writers!! :)</p>
<p>Ok, now on to ideas to exploit some of their weaknesses:</p>
<p>One of our strengths is that we're global. We have apes who speak ALL SORTS of languages. We could achieve the same effect with google translate, but if we throw certain KEY words in our posts into a different language, we force the analytics to analyse every post for translation. If we get into right-to-left written languages (Farsi, Arabic etc), that introduces another thing they have to code for.</p>
<p>From a tech level, if we took a week and posted every text post in picture mode, sideways, that's some more computation power we force them to use. Even better if we orient some characters in unorthodox positions in the said pictures.</p>
<p>HAH! Thanks u/chaoticdickhead! لدي نصيحة لاستخدام مترجم جوجل.  أدخل رسالتك باللغة الإنجليزية ، ثم انسخ الرد والصقه للتأكد من أنه منطقي عند ترجمته مرة أخرى.  أيضًا ، اجعل رسائلك بسيطة ؛  لا تفرط في استخدام الأفعال المعقدة وحروف الجر وما إلى ذلك.</p>
<p>From u/bryanthecrab: I think one simple technique would be to write posts from the bottom up? like this:</p>
<p>buy and hold</p>
<p>ape dont fight ape</p>
<p>c</p>
<p>b</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>this post will be written from the bottom up</p>
<p>greeetings ape</p>
<p>If we layer these ideas, computation costs just skyrocketed. Our whole idea is to make them pay more to figure out what we mean, what we want, and what we are doing (individually of course).</p>
<p>Now, why am I taking the trouble to write this. One, ape want banan, gib plz. Two, in the history of mankind, conflict and war has always been presented to us as horizontal. Our personal differences in religion, in race, in love, in nationality, in politics, have been exploited forever to divide us. There's a bible story that applies here: The tower of Babel. Humankind essentially all came together and said they could reach god through being excellent to each other and cooperating. God was like lol nope, now you all can't speak to or understand each other. The things that are said to us to get us to spend, live, or be in a certain way are said for a reason. The battlefield does exist, but it isn't horizontal, it's vertical. The moment any layer of that vertical structure coalesces into a community that's willing to agree to disagree, respect personal differences, and cooperate, the layer above it is straight fucked, and that layer will pull all stops to avoid being surpassed.</p>
<p>Now, I fully believe in the capabilities and willingness of those trying to run this show to do anything. So here's my backstory, in case someone tries to use it in the future to drive a wedge between me and the apes. This is my personal choice to provide.</p>
<p>I was home-schooled (could be used to call me dumb and/or strange). I am trans (could be tried to use to drive another wedge or paint a target on my back). I am getting medically retired from the US military for Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, all tied to a family member killing their self and a couple sexual assaults against folks I cared about, by members of the service I chose. (could be used to level an attack against my mental acuity) I've got the psychologist papers that say I'm still fully cognizant and sharp, I'm just bitter and traumatized.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the end apes, we have our greatest strength: we give a shit about our fellow humans. If (when) we get the tendies, we make our world better. If we somehow don't get them, we make the world better, but it's harder and we don't have as much impact. Love you all, stay excellent.</p>
