    "selftext": "I recall seeing comments and posts about how the crazy increase of online users from 20k all the way to 150k in the sub felt abnormal and weird. Some people theorized and suggested that it might be bots programmed by shills designed to strike fear upon us by making it seem that we have gained massive popularity, just for the number of active users to decrease a few weeks later to make it seem like people are giving up on the stock. Definitely nothing suspicious or a bot attack by Shitadel that a few people suggested these past few days.",
