    "selftext": "# TOP EDIT: Proven FALSE.\n\nBy replicating the technique that RC used to upload this image - creation of the tombstone in safari, followed by a long press on the picture then saving to photos and finally tweeting using the twitter for iphone app by selecting the tombstone from the photostream, I was able to exactly recreate the image that he uploaded:\n\n    0087a321d313450fafa99dc59ad83a4c8abaf6b0  cohen_i_made_photo.jpeg\n    0087a321d313450fafa99dc59ad83a4c8abaf6b0  cohen.jpeg\n\nThe cohen.jpeg is RC's version, the cohen\\_i\\_made\\_photo.jpeg is the version that I made on my iphone, saved to my photos, and then uploaded via the twitter app. As you can see, the shasums are identical. The probability of a sha1 collision if the files were different is around 3.4\\*10\\^-39, and requires the generation of 10\\^24 hashes to achieve. To prove that this is not a random unluckily colision, here is a sha512:\n\n    5ba97f9e44f950c76137eb42a23eedc5c0a9f84973fad39a417319008695ed762161af629c007371f7fcb77b976caa395e159bd72fd50ddd59bbce8643697f01  cohen_i_made_photo.jpeg\n    5ba97f9e44f950c76137eb42a23eedc5c0a9f84973fad39a417319008695ed762161af629c007371f7fcb77b976caa395e159bd72fd50ddd59bbce8643697f01  cohen.jpeg\n\nAgain, identical.\n\n# This means that this post is 100% incorrect.\n\n\\---\n\nEdit: TA;DR: [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) is the hiding of text within images and media. I think maybe Papa hid a message in the tombstone image.\n\nA long long time ago, several past lives ago actually, this ape used to be a hacker. This was in the days of yore, when dialling into BBS's was just stopping being a thing, irc was the communications tool of choice, phone phreaking was still possible, and hacking was done predominantly to learn.\n\nAnyway, as I sat here staring at Papa's tweet, this gnawing was going on in the back of my brain. I couldn't shake it, so I spun up a container with some useful tools and started doing some investigation on what he posted.\n\nFirst of all, this is an image that I made, downloaded directly from the tombstone site:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qczon13zz171.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69e964c39437cf9e8ea7efc48bc564d5c7e2f10c\n\n    Exif\n    ====\n    +---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n    | key                 | value                                                       |\n    +---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n    | Directory           | /data                                                       |\n    | Comment             | CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v80), default quality |\n    |                     |                                                             |\n    | FileInodeChangeDate | 2021:05:29 04:11:52+00:00                                   |\n    | ImageSize           | 400x313                                                     |\n    | SourceFile          | /data/tombstone.jpeg                                        |\n    | FileSize            | 35 kB                                                       |\n    | JFIFVersion         | 1.01                                                        |\n    | YResolution         | 180                                                         |\n    | FilePermissions     | rw-r--r--                                                   |\n    | FileType            | JPEG                                                        |\n    | BitsPerSample       | 8                                                           |\n    | Megapixels          | 0.125                                                       |\n    | EncodingProcess     | Baseline DCT, Huffman coding                                |\n    | ImageHeight         | 313                                                         |\n    | ColorComponents     | 3                                                           |\n    | FileName            | tombstone.jpeg                                              |\n    | FileTypeExtension   | jpg                                                         |\n    | MIMEType            | image/jpeg                                                  |\n    | YCbCrSubSampling    | YCbCr4:2:0 (2 2)                                            |\n    | ImageWidth          | 400                                                         |\n    | XResolution         | 180                                                         |\n    | FileModifyDate      | 2021:05:29 04:11:41+00:00                                   |\n    | FileAccessDate      | 2021:05:29 04:44:10+00:00                                   |\n    | ResolutionUnit      | inches                                                      |\n    | ExifToolVersion     | 10.4                                                        |\n    +---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n    JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 180x180, segment length 16, comment: \"CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v80), default quality\", baseline, precision 8, 400x313, frames 3\n\nI then tweeted it and downloaded it from there -

So I then remade Papa's tombstone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/smrgyjo6zz171.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49e57bb246fbd58ef9c64a3ede679d913b3ced36\n\nI repeated the same test, uploading it to twitter then downloading it again, and running it through stegdetect:\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# stegdetect cohen_* -s 0.6\n    cohen_i_made.jpg : negative\n    cohen_twitter_i_made.jpeg : negative\n\nWhy did I go through all of these steps? Well, it's because if I run stegdetect on Papa's image, it finds something interesting:\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# stegdetect cohen.jpeg -s 0.5\n    cohen.jpeg : negative\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# stegdetect cohen.jpeg -s 0.6\n    cohen.jpeg : outguess(old)(*)\n\nI'm intentionally decreasing the sensitivity here from the default of 1 to reduce the potential of a false positive. For comparison, I baked some data into my own rip dumb ass test file, to see how much would need to be added before it would detect.\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# wc -c input\n        1591 test\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# outguess-0.13 -k \"test\" -d input cohen_i_made.jpg test.jpg\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# stegdetect test.jpg -s 0.5\n    test.jpg : negative\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# stegdetect test.jpg -s 0.6\n    test.jpg : outguess(old)(*)\n\nThe answer is 1591 bytes, which is equivalent to this block of random garbage latin that is completely **unrelated** other than to serve as an example of how much text 1591 bytes is:\n\n>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Etiam biam.\n\nI then went ahead and extracted it and checked the shasum of the source data and extracted data:\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# outguess-0.13 -r -k \"test\" test.jpg output\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# shasum input output\n    e8f1ae201384f8b025f8157eaf93e3482adcca22  input\n    e8f1ae201384f8b025f8157eaf93e3482adcca22  output\n\nHere's that image, containing the lorem text above!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2i7e12p00271.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d04e34a6132f8505d15734ada2299fdfc85e2fd\n\nI then uploaded my steganographic file to twitter, then downloaded it and attempted to extract the data. Whatever twitter is doing to the file bricks it:\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# outguess-0.13 -r -k \"test\" E2iC6v-VkAIrsLQ.jpeg testing\n    Unknown data type of E2iC6v-VkAIrsLQ.jpeg\n\nAnd this is exactly the problem I'm hitting trying to get outguess-0.13 to read Papa's file. Whatever twitter's image processing is doing, is corrupting it - if there is in fact outguess steganography baked in.\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# outguess-0.13 -r -k \"stonk\" cohen.jpeg papas_message\n    Unknown data type of cohen.jpeg\n\nSo over to you guys... I've reached the limit of my 20+ year out of date abilities, and I'm hoping someone else who is more current with forensic steganalysis can perhaps tickle out what is baked in if there is anything.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong, [stegdetect can throw false positives.](https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/187568/Microsoft_Word_-_Stegdetect_article_-_Final.pdf)\n\nEdit: Thanks to u/Lucent_Sable for kicking my brain into gear. Pulled on diffing the image data thread and what do you know:\n\n[My version, uploaded then downloaded from twitter](https://preview.redd.it/x07m7hi680271.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07641d1fed66c95890ebc31633df931427bcd051)\n\n[RC's version downloaded from twitter](https://preview.redd.it/bh38yg4980271.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=230591f1b06390ea11dfcfcdc14ef2c86b575de4)\n\n[Imagemagick compare diff of the images](https://preview.redd.it/k2rlpzb580271.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d00f9a013e13f2f51ff0d5fb711577cc681bcd91)\n\nIn terms of raw hex, there are indeed differences. A whole heap of extra data in RC's image vs mine:\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# wc -l mytwitter.hex cohen.hex\n      2134 mytwitter.hex\n      2465 cohen.hex\n\nDoing a diff of the hex data basically spits out the entire file, it is that different.\n\nEdit: u/midgetforce2k requested pixel subtraction:\n\n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# convert cohen.jpeg cohen_twitter_i_made.jpeg -compose subtract -composite -threshold 0.001 -negate -alpha copy -negate mask.jpg \n    root@12eac4cd5911:/data# convert cohen.jpeg mask.jpg -composite composite.jpg \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqtezlh5e0271.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47e7fbac70257f04913fcf0c3d5d50bf070624c1\n\nEdit 3 May 20: Lots of requests to upload my tombstone to twitter again to see if there is any algorithmic modification taking place, or compression artifacts changing the file.\n\nHere's the outcome of doing it through a computer, twice:\n\n    8535a005c9d69ac348216266efb2b3d7c3710e9e  cohen_twitter_2.jpg\n    8535a005c9d69ac348216266efb2b3d7c3710e9e  cohen_twitter_i_made.jpeg\n\nAs you can see, the shasum of both files, uploaded 11 hours apart then download from twitter are identical, so twitter isn't doing anything extra that would make the same image be different each time.\n\nRC uses twitter for iphone though, so let's try that too:\n\n    0087a321d313450fafa99dc59ad83a4c8abaf6b0  cohen_i_made_photo.jpeg\n    0087a321d313450fafa99dc59ad83a4c8abaf6b0  cohen.jpeg\n    234bd3c4c46137311c2c65016dcabbdd7c5ddbc5  cohen_i_made_pasted.jpeg\n\nWell, that is simultaneously disappointing as well as revalatory.\n\nUsing the tombstone builder, then copying the outputted image and pasting it into twitter results in a different file, so we know for sure that is not the step that RC took to post this.\n\nHowever, saving the tombstone to photos on the iphone and then tweeting it results in an identical shasum to the image that RC posted.\n\nUnfortunately that means that there is definitely no steg baked into this, that this is merely a false positive caused by whatever shenanigans iOS is doing when you save an image from the web to your photos.\n\nI feel happy but disappointed.\n\nFinal Edit: I have removed the Possible DD flair from this post and updated it to discussion as this theory has now been proven false.",
