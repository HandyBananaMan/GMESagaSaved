<p>As the title says, it is very important to secure and 2FA all your banking/brokerage accounts and email addresses. I would also advise everyone to change their password to a STRONG password related to NOTHING else. </p>
<p>Also I’ve heard gmail is a lot more secure than yahoo and other email domains. It may be a good idea to change to gmail or do further research.</p>
<p>EDIT 1: 2FA = multi-factor authentication</p>
<p>EDIT 2: getting downvoted by shills already I see</p>
<p>EDIT 3: (from the comments) Protonmail is very secure</p>
<p>EDIT 4: it is important to secure you accounts because once you have a ton of money even your “friends and family” will want it. Some may even go to the extremes behind your back to receive it, so just secure yourself in every way possible.</p>
<p>EDIT 5: there is a lot of good information in the comments (don’t just look at the top ones)</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for the karma!</p>
<p>BUY. HODL. VOTE. SECURE.</p>
