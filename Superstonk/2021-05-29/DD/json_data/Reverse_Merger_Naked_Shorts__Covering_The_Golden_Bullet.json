We want GameStop\u2019s leaders to do their jobs and implement a strategy for bringing the Company into the 21st century.\n\n**In the RC Ventures and Gamestop Agreement RC Ventures has reserved the right to acquire 19.9% of Gamestop. If Ryan is taking full control he wants a bigger stake.**\n\n[RC Ventures agreement with Gamestop:](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119380521000031/e620202_ex99-1.htm)(i) acquire, seek or propose (publicly or otherwise) or agree to acquire, beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly and acting alone or in concert, whether by purchase, tender or exchange offer, through the acquisition of control of another person, by joining a partnership, limited partnership, syndicate or other group, or through swap or hedging transactions or otherwise, any securities of the Company or any rights decoupled from the underlying securities of the Company that would result in **RC Ventures (together with its Affiliates and Associates) owning, controlling or otherwise having any beneficial ownership interest in or aggregate economic exposure of more than 19.9% of the outstanding shares** of Common Stock; provided, however, that RC Ventures agrees that, immediately upon RC Ventures (together with its Affiliates and Associates) acquiring beneficial ownership, or becoming the beneficial owner, of 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock without prior Board approval, (A) RC Ventures (together with its Affiliates and Associates, as applicable) shall be considered an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d of the Company as defined in Delaware General Corporation Law \u00a7 203 (\u201cDGCL\u00a0203\u201d) (but, for this purpose, replacing 15% in such definition with 20.0%) as if the 203 Approval referred to in Section 3 had not been granted and (B) the Company shall be subject to the restrictions on any business combination (as defined in DGCL 203) with RC Ventures (together with its Affiliates and Associates, as applicable) as an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d enumerated in DGCL 203 for a period of three years following such time RC Ventures (together with its Affiliates and Associates) came to beneficially own 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock;\n\n# ******************************************[Naked Shorts Can't Stay Naked Forever](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/)\n\nKnight Capital was Market Maker (Sound familiar):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vub7ik7gm3271.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=85fdeb561ca51c4afb0682d3194c74c0b11f9419\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/br71fwhmm3271.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=27767aca67fb72b2f6f1c7e22b26a46173b4384e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kb7gc4sum3271.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=269820c1b1bd2a5c355ce17b8d112439b4a9ed73\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slus6koxm3271.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7263674efeb621fe69e373636cbe73ef6e1280e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ru824im6n3271.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=32c89441a1712f266f67d87f5e11d934df26883d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** A Market Maker can bury their Naked Shorts even if the CUSIP changes but it will show up on their balance sheet as an ever-ballooning obligation. Financial regulators SHOULD be able to note this and 'hopefully' they will do their jobs.\n\nAny short that IS NOT a Market Maker can not escape the cussip change if their short is naked.\n\n# Normal Reverse Mergers result in GREAT GAINS\n\n[With GME we may see the greatest Reverse Merger gains in history](https://preview.redd.it/d5oo7x6qn3271.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=c174ae58c0d2c5e326bcb2d8168eb0deb4a766c6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison of SPAC returns to Shells, note this article is very old \\(2009\\) but it still demonstrates how much of a positive catalyst Reverse Mergers can be](https://preview.redd.it/09an7rvwn3271.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a81ed8a9e93a5fbb0a98d98acf431a33652e87c)\n\nSource:[https://greenbackd.com/2009/10/07/shell-out-for-shells/](https://greenbackd.com/2009/10/07/shell-out-for-shells/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: How are your options affected by a corporate action:**\n\n**Since people are asking...**[https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-3951800/INF57995\\_114923.pdf](https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-3951800/INF57995_114923.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmb9pvle06271.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cedb59564a3e8cc71ea826e29589da7805d58ed\n\n**EDIT 2: eToro and Stock Merger:**\n\n**Since people are asking...**[https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/1561213922/what-happens-if-my-stock-is-affected-by-a-corporate-event-such-as-a-delisting-or-merger/](https://www.etoro.com/customer-service/help/1561213922/what-happens-if-my-stock-is-affected-by-a-corporate-event-such-as-a-delisting-or-merger/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Seems like eToro will sell at merger price:\n\n\"*If you hold stock positions in a company that is acquired as part of a merger:*\n\n>All open positions\u00a0will be closed at the merger deal price, and any profit or loss incurred from these trades will be reflected in your Available balance.  \n>  \n>In cases where the value of the new stock is greater than the original stock, you will receive the notional amount of the acquisition terms, based\u00a0on the difference between the last rate traded before the original stock's delisting and the value of the new stock. This amount will appear as a dividend in your account statement.\"\n\nBut what is happening here is a reverse merger... so I am totally unclear how this broker would take care of this instance.\n\nIn a normal merger the target company gets acquired for a set price, so this explanation above makes sense. But we are looking at a reverse merger and I could not find anything on eToro about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*TLDR:\\*\\***\n\nA Reverse Merger is the only real MOASS Catalyst which is best for EVERYONE (except any naked shorter). The DTCC rules protect the bad actors from the good but these rules will not themselves trigger any short covering, Gamestop et al MUST be the catalyst.\n\nOnly Market Makers can escape covering on a CUSIP change by burying their naked short obligations in their balance sheet as \"Sold by not yet purchased\" liabilities. Financial regulators/auditors should notice this ballooning liability and do something about it.\n\nOf course any hedge funds which are not market makers can not escape covering their naked shorts. Game theory suggests that any hedge fund which has a chance of surviving covering a small GME short position will do so at first opportunity.\n\nLegitimate shorts will also seek to cover as stock performance after a Reverse Merger is almost always quite dramatically positive. They may choose to re-enter at a later date/price.\n\nReverse Mergers are also not controversial and completely OK with the SEC while a crypto dividend may open Gamestop up to litigation. It also does not allow Ryan to accumulate more of Gamestop at pre-moass prices, so a reverse merger is the golden bullet.\n\n**If we are right you are about to see the greatest return on your shares in financial history**\n\nRemember...\n\n10 x gains are boring and happen all the time\n\n100 x gains are great\n\n1000 x gains are history (This is DFV at today's prices)\n\n10,000 x gains have happened for early investors in big companies and in digital tokens\n\nIt is not wrong to imagine yourself so lucky to be at the center of the greatest MOASS ever conceived.\n\nRemember Gamestop is transforming into a digital ecosystem for developers, publishers, content creators, players with it's own NFT and digital currency that will support ownership. We're ever living in a more and more digital world and digital game assets are a win for the developers, the studios, the content creators, the players and collectors... and the platform that facilitates this. Gamecoin will be a game changer. We are at an iPod moment. Remember to buy back in and support this legendary turn around with our hero at the helm.\n\n**Step 1:** Reverse Merger, RC gets more control and his stake doubles at pre-MOASS prices\n\n**Step 2:** Issue crypto dividend and blow up the Last Standing Market Makers\n\n**Step 3:** Profit???\n\nEDIT MAY 31st, 2021:**STRATEGY THEORY UPDATE**After some good DD, and some bad, it seems it is inconclusive that a CUSIP change will require Naked Shorts to be covered or resolved (Thanks Dr T et al).\n\nThis does mean that **STEP 2 will likely be very necessary to force them to cover (Crypto Dividend)** however many may begin covering if they even suspect it is coming- so an announcement of Gamecoin could still spark similar price action.\n\nA merger with RC Ventures is still the best vehicle for Ryan Chohen to acquire more equity in Gamestop AND pump Gamestop with more Cash. Mechanism is RC Ventures is basically a shell investment vehicle loaded with cash and Game would acquire them for equity. In this updated theory GME ticker would stay around since Gamestop is the acquirer, if indeed the change does not solve the problem. This also might be beneficial for some GME holders in eToro etc who were confusing people with their merger procedure.\n\nNow remember that a merger of this type would bring more cash to Gamestop and naturally the value of GME would go up. It would also be bullish as fuck if RC doubled down again and bought more Gamestop at current prices (which would be the terms of that merger). So you can still imagine it's possible this in itself may cause a rush to cover and the MOASS could begin. I still do not know what it would take for Citidel to get margin called by their brokers but I suppose this could still be a mechanism for MOASS, however I think they may be able to buy sufficient time, maybe naked short more, and a crypto-dividend is the only way.\n\nRemember: **We are in a completely fraudulent system! It must be remade!**\n\n&#x200B;",
