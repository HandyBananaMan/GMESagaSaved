<p>Fucking pumped just thinking about it.  The squeeze is going to be days, if not weeks, of highs and lows.  I don't think there will ever be anything like it again, enjoy every moment.  It may be the most alive you feel for the rest of your life.  It is definitely going to be surreal.</p>
<p>At least we will have millions/billions of dollars to comfort ourselves with once it's over.  Don't forget to help those in need if everything collapses afterwards.  Be better than the greedy fucks the world has now.  Enjoy your weekend apes!</p>
