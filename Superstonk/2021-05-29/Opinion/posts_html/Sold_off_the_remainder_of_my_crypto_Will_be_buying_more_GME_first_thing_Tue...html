<p>Selling off all my crypto is actually a big deal to me. Im a bit of a die hard. And yet here we are. I've been a GME shareowner since February. I've always believed GME is the best play, but it's becoming more apparent that it is the only play. Yes I still own one other stock that I won't mention, but I no longer have any crypto.</p>
<p><strong> I have also left quite a few different Reddit sub communities I was in.</strong></p>
<p>Edit* won't be 9:30 because funds of sold crypto will likely not be available in my account on Tuesday morning yet. Asap tho</p>
