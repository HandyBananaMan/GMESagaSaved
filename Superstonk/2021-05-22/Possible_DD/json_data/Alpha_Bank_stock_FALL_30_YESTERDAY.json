    "selftext": "ok \n\nWhat is ALPHA BANK . \n\nWell it's the biggest bank of Greece . And the most traded stock of Greece market .\n\n Had a free fall at Friday. \n\nOk who gives a sh!t\n well .... \n\nI read a post from a newspaper (online) that say:\n\n\"Alpha Bank had hired JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE to investigate the possibility of raising funds amounting to approximately 800 million euros, to finance its development project from Greece.\"\n\nhttps://www.newmoney.gr/roh/agores/trapeziko-krach-sto-chrimatistirio-sto-limit-down-i-alpha-bank/ \n( It's on Greek good luck with Google translate)\n\nHmmm ok and why the stock free fall . The article say cuz alpha making a big move to something and needs help \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a ( yea rghit) \n\nBest part is that the fall happent from the start at 10:30 \nAnd stop at 10:50 with 20% down . After that went up and then tank down and the hole Greek market pause for  2 hours .\n\n Hmmm \ud83e\udd14 bikooneeeeect fall around that time .\n\n\n\nBUT WHAIT THERE IS MORE \n\nLet's leave alpha . \nAnd focus on the Greek stock market . \nOwww the whole market is down. There was some liquidations . Hmmm. Ok it's the Greek market classic buuuuut why liquidations on Greek banks ? Who need money ? And sells stocks off Greek banks \ud83e\udd14\n\nhttps://www.newmoney.gr/roh/agores/chrimatistirio-to-sell-off-stis-trapezes-vithise-ton-geniko-dikti/\n( It's on Greek good luck with Google translate)\n\n\n!  Apes I need some help here to connect the dots  you are welcome to correct me and help me ! \n\n\n\n\nTL:DR\nSo what we have here . A big sell of Greek banks stocks . The best trading stock of Greece in general fall 30% and bring the Greek market down too . Alpha Bank hire JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE to boost capital ???? And the stock fall 30%??? Ow some news talk about liquidations too . \ud83e\udd14\n\n\n\nEDIT1: FOUND SOMETHING AT YAHOO too \nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/alpha-bank-hires-jpmorgan-goldman-103532937.html\n\nEDIT2: it's a possible DD I don't know where this connects and how , but we all know banks are fuckt . LOOKS LIKE ALL BANKS ARE . \n\nEDIT3: thanks u/gettingroastedagain for this comment :\n\nSo I was recently offered to buy shit tier BBB- bonds from Alpha bank. I'm Greek and live here, so I will try and write a summary of the article for you guys.   \n\n\nBasically it says that there were a lot of liquidations taking place today (Technically yesterday 21/05) dropping the Greek stock market down by 3,9% and due to Alpha bank losing around 30% of its value today it created a bearish sentiment affecting all 4 major greek banks. Piraeus(-6%), National Bank of Greece(-13%) and Eurobank(-5%).   \n\n\nAll of this happened because Alpha bank was trying to increase their capital. All major Greek banks have been facing money issues last 5 years. Attica bank though already did something similar back in September according to the article.  \n\n\nIt seems like the article has some credibility since it was also reported by other major outlets, but do correct me if I am wrong here.\n\n\nEDIT4\n\nOh alpha Bank stock is like coca cola stock . Slow and for boomers . Best day 2% up worst 2% down . ( Before the big boom at Greece 2015 was better)\n\nEDIT5 Thanks u/Tombstone_Shorty for this . \nHmmmmm Interesting . \nhttps://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2021/3/3/14786-21.pdf\n\nEDIT6 I will call a friend that works inside the bank and ask him stuff ( he is a good friend ) and the brother of my best friend works at Greek stock market . I will try to find some info for all of this , maybe make a new DD on this \n\n\nEDIT7   \n u/corradodomingo    SPECULATE That :  \"if I had to orchestrate a financial crisis in europe and hide the real reason, I would start in Greece. \"\nThis is correct , 2008 Greece and Portugal was the very first that took the hit . \n\n\nI just try to connect some dots, maybe this doesn't connect to GME . Or maybe the bigging of the end has already started days ago. \n\nEdit 100bilion \n\nOMG THANK YOU FOR THE AWARD APES AND SUPPORT . BEST COMMUNITY IN THE PLANET LOVE YOU ALL \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
