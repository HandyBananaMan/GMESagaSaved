<p>German Apes went full monkey mode and got their broker reversed and are able to vote as of yesterday.  The only thing they did was mail en mass to their regulators. Yes only that!</p>

<p><strong>I even made  a template below for you extra lazy apes copy paste it , click and send away!</strong></p>
<p>After doing so notify Nordnet that you did so. This will cause a shake up.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason you found your viking spirit and want to go full ape mode then mail a complained to the following association and authority as they are European financial and free trade regulators.</p>

<p>Edit: Note to self. Never could have thought but hoped this would get traction.</p>
<p>Scandiapes are awake in full force with backing from a shit ton of International apes. Before apes can say "don't dance, A <strong>lo</strong>t has to be done. One of the important ones right now is to MAIL . Yes back the Scandiapes and Mail to.  I am not going to thank you, thank your self for being awake and start to take charge! This is not over i can promise Apes that!</p>
<p>Edit Final: Hang on hang hang on! For the love of Josef Maria and Gamestop what happened with all of you?  Looks that Apes are awake. I do have a job and yes i do work in the weekend. Tried to respond and give awards to all of you but simply can not keep up! AGAIN Thank your self, Mail your regulators and Authorities take back what is yours!  Never Financial advice!</p>
