I know it's easy to get caught up in everything that's going on here on Reddit around GME... 

From Jan/before WSB days to GME days and now to Superstonk, even the smoothest brain apes has been growing a few wrinkles while full-blown addicted to the endorphin drip of Karma.

\--- Nothing wrong with this. 

BUT HERE'S MY POINT

I encourage all of you to take a step back and go through some of DFVs Youtube Videos. 

I'm obviously a huge fan of his, but with the craziness that's been going on I've never taken the time to actually watch his channel from the start. 

This is a MASTER level trading education that he has put together FOR FREE just sitting there on YouTube. 

He teaches everything he used to come up with the Gamestop thesis and his strategy has obviously proven out by leading to MOASS.

This is like a look inside any one of the greatest traders of all times EXACT strategy and a documentary following their logic to the point of greatest. 

(Think Buffett or Burry or whoever you look up to)

DFV has his Security Analyst knowledge all there for you to learn from. 

This will be important, because after MOASS instead of JUST buying lambos and doing good in the world, one of your biggest challenges (as have been proven with so many lotto winners over the years) will be holding on to your new found wealth...

ANYWAY... I'm currently going back and studying his journey... I think you should too. (Even if it is difficult and takes you time to figure out what the hell he is talking about)
