Just a few items and then you can get back to your weekend!\n\nOkay, this just came to me today, but I just saw this comment:\n\n>\"A.P.E. means ALL PEOPLE EQUAL we are all apes.  This is the way.\u201d -u/Skeetbombs\n\nAnd can you not think of anything more diamond-perfect in your apish lives??? How is this not the most perfect thing: \"All People Equal\" - it's even in ape speak. \"All Apes Same\" is the same meaning.\n\nIt's perfect. Like a diamond. \ud83e\udd29\n\n# Life Finds a Way\n\nThere's been a lot of FUD lately and generally try to follow a simple philosophy: counter it with HYPE. This keeps us thinking and creatively concocting ways to keep the sub stonky.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ftt36turm071.jpg?width=1424&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=927238b4a6a7cfd3032962bbea44cf530c786db3\n\n**So, we have made some upgrades to three mods' permissions:** \n\n* u/luridess \n* u/jsmar18\n* u/catto_del_fatto\n\nIn addition to proving their merit as mods of this sub and hosts of r/Superstonk Live, they have been working diligently to review DD, transcribe AMAs, facilitate projects, monitor the well-being of the sub, and overall have become invaluable members of the team.\n\nThe added permissions now include all but system settings and wiki. They are now at the same level as the other established mods. Thank you both for being Apes First!!\n\n**Additionally, we have added two new mods with limited permissions:**\n\nu/sharkbaitlol \\- the author of [Chaos Theory - The Everything Connection](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mokvhk/chaos_theory_the_everything_connection/) will be working on creating a Wiki DD Database as well as being a DD focused mod\n\nu/Bradduck_Flyntmoore \\- has a lot of experience dealing with people and will be helping us moderate the sub and foster a strong ape community\n\nThese two have been in mod chat for a few days and the whole mod team is excited to make them official. Let's give them a huge welcome!!\n\n# Did you vote?\n\nComment anywhere on r/Superstonk under any post **!apevote!** to get your vote flair. Can't vote?

I am very excited about this because this is very much in line with what I like to see: the community.\n\n Here is a word from u/PinkCatsOnAcid: \n\n>Welcome to the Jungle Beat  \n>  \n>This daily post will be written by apes, for apes. Whatever exciting stuff you see happening around Superstonk and within the ape community, is the essence of the Jungle Beat. Imagine the Superstonk Daily with a Lazer focus on the community. u/Bye_Triangle and myself  will be bringing you trusted, verified information including special announcements and regular updates from your mod team.  \n>  \n>Superstonk is just the stage we have built. The stars of the show are you apes. \ud83d\udc97\n\nMake sure you look for The Jungle Beat posts starting Monday!\n\n# Coming Soon on r/Superstonk Live\n\nMake sure you subscribe and enable notifications to stay updated on the [**Superstonk Live Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4EET9NJPWxUuXGlG6fxPA).\n\n>[https://www.youtube.com/c/Superstonk](https://www.youtube.com/c/Superstonk)\n\n[**Monday, May 24 @ 4:30 p.m**](https://youtu.be/wuPizlDY0Ys)\\*\\*Lucy Komisar, Investigative Journalist (Part 2)\\*\\*Hosted by u/Luridess\n\n[**Wednesday, June 2 @ 4:30 p.m.**](https://youtu.be/q8-JO3g5bm4)\\*\\*Wes Christian, Legal Advocate for Financial Reform (Part 2)\\*\\*Hosted by Lucy Komisar\n\n# New YouTutube Programming\n\n**I am thrilled to announce our latest idea for the YouTube:** an ape-focused discussion show, to be held weekly on the weekends, moderated by a sub mod (or non-mod), and starring... You, the true apes!\n\n[Things are great, but they could be better!](https://preview.redd.it/qotf9alwrm071.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26eb0d380271f7a80b3ea5ab136554c4944a3bf8)\n\nThe idea is simple. We can host up to 10 people at once and live stream them over the Superstonk Youtube Channel. We would select people to join the stream beforehand, or even during, and can use this as a way to let apes discuss topics on the sub as a group for all to see. This could also be a great way for the community to ask questions and have the panel discuss.\n\nIf selected, you would receive an invite link that lets you easily connect to the live stream. Then a live editor (currently me) will run tech in the background to bring people on and off, turn on screen share or graphics, and even put Live Chat questions onto the screen.\n\nWe are still formulating details for how this will be structured, and we want to start with one panel per week due to our schedules. However, based on community reaction, I'm sure it will evolve over time into something truly special.\n\n**However, first thing is first. We need a title.** We picked three fairly solid options so please use the poll below... Or leave a suggestion in the comments.\n\nMy favorite is *Monkey Business* \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udcbc\n\n# Onward, and Upward \ud83d\ude80\n\nI'm excited for what is next. Thanks for being ApesTogetherStrong!!!\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d Ook ook \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\n\n[Be excellent to each other.](https://i.redd.it/zqoukljzrm071.gif)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nilq5f)",
