<p>EDIT: Updating to include Wes Christian as a reviewer.</p>
<p>I have officially finished the HOC part II and submitted it to Dr. T, Wes Christian and Dave Lauer (u/dlauer) for review. They are welcome to share among their peers, as well. </p>
<p>I have shared this document with the MOD team and asked them to keep it hush-hush until we receive feedback. They can give their impression, but not any detail. </p>
<p>That being said, it is a 24 page word document explaining how big the House of Cards truly is. Instead of trimming out vital information, I have decided to double-drop parts II &amp; III at the same time once I have feedback from the experts. </p>
<p>I appreciate everyone being patient and ask for you to give our experts the time they need to fully review the findings. This is important and I appreciate all of their efforts to make the story airtight. </p>
