<p>Hey,</p>
<p>i already made a post about this and i just tried to dig a bit deeper into who was the seller of this painting and i think it is a really reasonable assumption that it is KenG's best buddy Steve Cohen. I simply did it for some entertainment i don't think it is relevant to the squeeze or something :D</p>
<p>This is the news:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are the reasons why i think this is true:</p>

<p>He bought another Picasso painting in the same year (2013), showing the same woman (Marie-Thérèse Walter)</p>
<p>-Steve Cohen buying "Le rêve" (2013):</p>

<p>" If he was trying to lay low after his fund settled the largest insider trading case ever with the SEC on March 15, <strong>then</strong> <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/steve-cohen/"><strong>Steve Cohen</strong></a> <strong>probably wasn’t too happy when the</strong> <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/sac_cohen_in_art_deal_ZJQ39Tc7T1ih0ss3eLozjJ"><strong><em>New York Post</em></strong></a>  <strong>uncovered his reportedly “top-secret” purchase</strong>.  The tabloid, citing “a  source,” reported Cohen’s purchase of the 1932 Picasso masterpiece on  Tuesday, dubbing it most expensive artwork ever purchased by a U.S.  collector.  Given it was a private sale, the actual purchase price may  never surface.

<p>-"Someone" buying "Woman sitting near a window" (also 2013):</p>

<p>The artwork was bought 2013 in <strong>London</strong>, but sold 2021 in <strong>New York</strong></p>
<p>" Also sold at the <strong>London auction</strong> was the 1914 piece by Egon Schiele,  Liebespaar - Selbstdarstellung mit Wally (Lovers - Self Portrait with  Wally), which fetched £7.9m. " (2013)</p>
<p>" Woman Sitting Near a Window (Marie-Therese) sold for $103.4m (£73.5m) on Thursday at Christie's auction house in <strong>New York</strong>. " (2021)</p>

<p>Steve Cohen just recently sold his apartment in New York</p>

<p>Steve Cohen is a fanatic "art - collector" / (better to say: tax evader):</p>
<p><a href="https://fortune.com/2016/10/22/steve-cohen-art-billionaire-point72/">https://fortune.com/2016/10/22/steve-cohen-art-billionaire-point72/</a></p>
<p>" Cohen keeps much of his collection at Point72’s offices in Stamford,  Conn., New York, London and Asia. Rotated among those offices about once  a quarter—a process that starts in the afternoon and can take all  night—the art is so casually placed throughout the halls that employees  occasionally brush up against it absentmindedly; one executive recently  dropped her ID badge into one of the sculptures accidentally. “It’s  mind-blowing what he’s put together,” says Larry Gagosian of the  prestigious Gagosian Gallery chain, Cohen’s longtime art dealer and  friend. <strong>“When you go to his home, you just see museum quality and  beyond, incredible art you just don’t find in private homes.”</strong> "</p>

<p>"In an extensive interview with <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/07/steve-cohen-201007"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>  from 2010, the hedgie’s art adviser Sandy Heller revealed Cohen had  bought <strong>more than 300 pieces</strong> since he began collecting in 2000."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr: Even though this is not a proof i think it is highly likely that Steve Cohen is forced to start selling off his art collection, starting with this picasso painting. I am keeping an eye on which artworks are getting sold in the next weeks and months.</strong></p>
