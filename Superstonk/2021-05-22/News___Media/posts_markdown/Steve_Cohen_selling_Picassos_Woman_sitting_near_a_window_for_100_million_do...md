Hey,

i already made a post about this and i just tried to dig a bit deeper into who was the seller of this painting and i think it is a really reasonable assumption that it is KenG's best buddy Steve Cohen. I simply did it for some entertainment i don't think it is relevant to the squeeze or something :D

This is the news:

&#x200B;

Here are the reasons why i think this is true:

1. &#x200B;

He bought another Picasso painting in the same year (2013), showing the same woman (Marie-Thérèse Walter)

\-Steve Cohen buying "Le rêve" (2013):

" If he was trying to lay low after his fund settled the largest insider trading case ever with the SEC on March 15, **then** [**Steve Cohen**](http://www.forbes.com/profile/steve-cohen/) **probably wasn’t too happy when the** [***New York Post***](http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/sac_cohen_in_art_deal_ZJQ39Tc7T1ih0ss3eLozjJ)  **uncovered his reportedly “top-secret” purchase**.  The tabloid, citing “a  source,” reported Cohen’s purchase of the 1932 Picasso masterpiece on  Tuesday, dubbing it most expensive artwork ever purchased by a U.S.  collector.  Given it was a private sale, the actual purchase price may  never surface. "

\-"Someone" buying "Woman sitting near a window" (also 2013):

&#x200B;

2)

The artwork was bought 2013 in **London**, but sold 2021 in **New York**

" Also sold at the **London auction** was the 1914 piece by Egon Schiele,  Liebespaar - Selbstdarstellung mit Wally (Lovers - Self Portrait with  Wally), which fetched £7.9m. " (2013)

" Woman Sitting Near a Window (Marie-Therese) sold for $103.4m (£73.5m) on Thursday at Christie's auction house in **New York**. " (2021)

3)

Steve Cohen just recently sold his apartment in New York

4)

Steve Cohen is a fanatic "art - collector" / (better to say: tax evader):

" Cohen keeps much of his collection at Point72’s offices in Stamford,  Conn., New York, London and Asia. Rotated among those offices about once  a quarter—a process that starts in the afternoon and can take all  night—the art is so casually placed throughout the halls that employees  occasionally brush up against it absentmindedly; one executive recently  dropped her ID badge into one of the sculptures accidentally. “It’s  mind-blowing what he’s put together,” says Larry Gagosian of the  prestigious Gagosian Gallery chain, Cohen’s longtime art dealer and  friend. **“When you go to his home, you just see museum quality and  beyond, incredible art you just don’t find in private homes.”** "

"In an extensive interview with [*Vanity Fair*](http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/07/steve-cohen-201007)  from 2010, the hedgie’s art adviser Sandy Heller revealed Cohen had  bought **more than 300 pieces** since he began collecting in 2000."

&#x200B;

**Tl;dr: Even though this is not a proof i think it is highly likely that Steve Cohen is forced to start selling off his art collection, starting with this picasso painting. I am keeping an eye on which artworks are getting sold in the next weeks and months.**
