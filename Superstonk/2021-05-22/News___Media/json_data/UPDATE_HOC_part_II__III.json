They are welcome to share among their peers, as well. \n\nI have shared this document with the MOD team and asked them to keep it hush-hush until we receive feedback. They can give their impression, but not any detail. \n\nThat being said, it is a 24 page word document explaining how big the House of Cards truly is. Instead of trimming out vital information, I have decided to double-drop parts II & III at the same time once I have feedback from the experts. \n\nI appreciate everyone being patient and ask for you to give our experts the time they need to fully review the findings. This is important and I appreciate all of their efforts to make the story airtight. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80",
