ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

I'll also be using equations from [u/JTH1](https://www.reddit.com/u/JTH1/)'s (aka "exponential floor guy") works.

# A. Quick Review

&#x200B;

In [Volume 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw8281/math_black_magic_vol_1_why_it_is_mathematically/), I break down an academic finance paper by John Finnerty. In it, he mathematically proves that **it's impossible to short a stock to zero without naked shorting AT LEAST as many shares as there are outstanding, doubling the float in the process.**

&#x200B;

In [Volume 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwy0oz/math_black_magic_vol_2_the_limit_does_not_exist/), I lay out how I think apes fucked up hedgies' algos initially, make conjecture on rates of change in our exponential graphs and show (through Finnerty's theories) that, **at this point, the number of shares needed to short $GME to zero does not mathematically exist.**

# B. Goal of This Volume

&#x200B;

So far we an equations that relate *P(t) to Q*

&#x200B;

[Demand Curves](https://preview.redd.it/sbv13sumfu471.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e2d69f476bb6add74ff9a5081c3e681283356f)

&#x200B;

And equations that relate *P(t)* to *t*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# My goal is to find an equation that can relate Q and t. That equation can possibly be used to find the real short interest.

# C. Hedgies' Curves

&#x200B;

*Case 1*

The hedgies' curves are the second equation in each list. First, I tried setting them equal to each other:

&#x200B;

[No new information here](https://preview.redd.it/8xr7dbtuiu471.png?width=1289&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ae5032792440214363242a29e88f9d59d687833)

&#x200B;

But, this doesn't really help me cause of I don't know *B*, so ~~I tried a little calculus~~  ~~did a little simple calculus~~ I had a math séance. Cover your eyes and skip to the next section if math horrifies you. I will begin the ritual with the traditional chant \*ahem\*

&#x200B;

EDIT: I made a mistake in notation, the derivative of the linear equation should be taken with respect to Q (d/dQ). This will not change the answer as P(t) = D(Q)

&#x200B;

Now that we've completed the ritual and the dark gods have gifted us an equation lets plot that bad boy and find the amount of shares:

&#x200B;

*Case 2*

For such a huge number, I figured I should try the calculation again with a value of 40 dollars and see what I got:

# D. Ape's Curves

&#x200B;

I will now perform part two of the math séance, by repeating the process above for the ape curve:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Now this is what things get VERY interesting, check out that asymptote:**

&#x200B;

**I'm not sure what the asymptote implies or represents, but I feel that its significant.**

&#x200B;

# E. Conclusion

&#x200B;

Thanks for coming to my APE Talk. Constructive criticism is always welcome!

# TL:DR -> Hedgies have naked shorted, at most, about 1.4 trillion shares and, at least, about 837 million shares.

TA:DR -> Hedgies have pissed off math gods. Hedgies r fuk.

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# F. Questions I Could Use Help With

&#x200B;

* **What does that asymptote represent?** Is this when it no longer becomes possible for hedgies to dilute the float meaningfully? Is this the stalemate that occurs when the shares are being bought at higher rate?
* **Have I calculated how many shares have been naked shorted or how many shares retail holds?** The way Finnerty frames it, I believe the shares I calculate are the amount of shares naked shorted. However, the demand curve equation says it describes how many shares retail investors hold. I think it can describe both, but I'm sure what context the results of my calculations are in.
