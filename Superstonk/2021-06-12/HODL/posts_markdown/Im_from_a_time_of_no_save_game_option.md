I can’t be ground down by starting over again. I’m from the generation of the first Nintendo, no save game option. I had to play Mario bros, punch out and Metroid over and over and over again and every time I turned it off guess what, start all over. This taught me unbelievable persistence in life, I’ll do something over and over again until it’s finished. I got stuck on one part of Metroid for 3 months straight and never gave up, just kept coming back for more. It took me 2 months to finally beat bald bull for fucks sake. I’ll never get tired or back down the shf can try to reset the price as much as they want every day and I’ll just keep coming back for more. Can’t stop, won’t stop 🦍🚀💎🙌
