Seeing several posts about various outlets who have time and time again shown their hand in what they represent (or don’t represent) in financial media coverage, specifically with GME. While one could argue the attention is good, remember how they have been self serving first and foremost. It is not a sudden shift in sentiment towards GME that comes without reason. Expect sentiment rug pulling, price anchoring, anything… in other words expect fuckery (same as it ever was). 

Media personalities have their own agendas: book sales, ad revenues, clicks, etc. That doesn’t even touch on potential conflicts of interest.

This is not a political post. This is not even going to single out any one or two news outlets. This subreddit is not political and I guarantee that there are people of every walk of life hodling GME… hence apes. Keep politics out of the sub and if you see arguments occurring… not everything is what it seems. State that this is a sub about GME and the company, Ignore, report, move on. Joining in will only fuel flames.
