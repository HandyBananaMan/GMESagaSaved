<p>As I've spent half my Saturday reading DD, while trying to watch some TV and veg at the same time (not really working), I just realized after reading one ape's comment along the line of:</p>
<p>"We can only succeed if we're willing to examine all DD from every angle and offer alternative ideas."</p>
<p>Before, when I would post, and often a contrarian thought, I would quickly get downvoted and receive numerous comments like:</p>
<p>"Sounds very FUD to me."</p>
<p>"Think this ape's a shill."</p>
<p>"Downvote this shit."</p>
<p>And I would get very frustrated because I believed and thought that you only had good DD by offering counter arguments and having a civilized discussion on it, and was wondering where these comments were coming from.</p>
<p>I've seen very little to none of these types of comments the last couple of weeks, and assuming (hoping) that SATORI has been doing it's job and doing it well.</p>
<p>Just wanted to share.</p>
