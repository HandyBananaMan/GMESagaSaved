    "selftext": "As I've spent half my Saturday reading DD, while trying to watch some TV and veg at the same time (not really working), I just realized after reading one ape's comment along the line of:\n\n\"We can only succeed if we're willing to examine all DD from every angle and offer alternative ideas.\"\n\nBefore, when I would post, and often a contrarian thought, I would quickly get downvoted and receive numerous comments like:\n\n\"Sounds very FUD to me.\"\n\n\"Think this ape's a shill.\"\n\n\"Downvote this shit.\"\n\nAnd I would get very frustrated because I believed and thought that you only had good DD by offering counter arguments and having a civilized discussion on it, and was wondering where these comments were coming from.\n\nI've seen very little to none of these types of comments the last couple of weeks, and assuming (hoping) that SATORI has been doing it's job and doing it well.\n\nJust wanted to share.",
