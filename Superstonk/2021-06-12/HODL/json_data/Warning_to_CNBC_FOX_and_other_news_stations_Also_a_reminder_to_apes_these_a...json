    "selftext": "  Media- Warning to all the news stations that are all a sudden reporting on what we have said since January that shorts haven't covered, GME is on track to go big, and naked shorts are big and illegal.  Dont think that apes are going to suddenly trust everything you say. \n  \nWe are more than prepared for when moass starts you all changing your tune at the price your bosses tell you to whether it be $1000, $10,000, $100,000.  We are expecting you all to report shorts have covered and apes are selling to make us think the moass is over.  We will not be deterred as we are full of really smart apes that can verify that none of these are true yet.  We own the float (multiple times) and we will set our sell prices period!  Yes we are expecting the paper hand bitches to believe you and sell out, but the large majority will diamond hand till we say its over!\n  \nSo your new tactic of buttering up and reporting what we have said and known for months will not make us follow you and trust your weak ass reports.  \n  \nI will be checking with lawyers on what the consequences would be if a media agency falsely reports on the moass that shorts have covered or apes have sold with no evidence.  I mean if you convince 1 ape to sell at $1000 instead of $25,000,000 with blantly false info, how would you not be held accountable?\n\nApes- do not fall for their new tactics.  Yes it is nice they are reporting some of the things we have known, but be prepared for them to try and earn our trust so that they can say when the moass has hit its high (magic number their bosses tell them). Only we will say where this rocket lands as they fucked up and put a bunch of retarded apes in the pilot seat!\n  \nTake absolutely no financial advice from me as I am just a dumb ass electrician and have no financial experience.  Everyone set their own prices and don't let the media or anyone else sway your price!\n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",
