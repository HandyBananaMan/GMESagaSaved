I've been seeing an uptick in content related to a particular member of the DTCC and citadel and some explicit statements this this person may have axed DTC-2021-005, or at least had the ability to. 

This isn't FUD or a shill-speak, but I urge this community caution. 

I want DTC-2021-005 approved and in force helping weigh our side of the scale as much as the next ape, but naming specific people and accusing them of illegal/unethical/potentially illegal actions without proof is not what we do here. Bring proof, bring DD, bring heat and transparency and the full force of our collective investigative efforts. But don't invite a libel action. 

My two cents. See you all on the moon!
