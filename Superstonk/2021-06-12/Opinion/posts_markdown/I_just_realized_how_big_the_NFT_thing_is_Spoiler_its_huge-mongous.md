GameStop's NFT trading platform will literally create a new market where none exists. Unfortunately AFAIK digital resale markets haven't been tested at the scale necessary to prove viability, but I think it's fair to say it could be massive. If GameStop can act as a broker for either peer-to-peer trades or something resembling their brick and mortar market, and they can get out ahead of any prospective competitors in terms of infrastructure (sort of a given at this point), they stand to make a killing. That is, at least until something better comes along.

The question for me is whether (ðŸ¤ž) or not (ðŸ‘Ž) they focus on peer-to-peer trades, because I can't find a way for competing NFT markets to exist under the same roof without dragging each other down.

Perhaps they'll operate both to test the market then drop whichever market underperforms. I don't know, I'm just a lay ape pontificAPEing.

So yeah, I'm excited about the potential here. This is the primary purpose for me planning to rebuy the stock when it settles at fair value after MOASS.

Edit: hey GS C-suite, if you're reading this and you need a PM to lead the NFT project, I would like an interview! DM me let's gooooo!!
