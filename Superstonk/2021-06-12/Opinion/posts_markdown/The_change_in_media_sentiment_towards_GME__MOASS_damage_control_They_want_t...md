They have never been on our side. Never will be. Those who have been here long enough have witnessed the fuckery every single day. One of the strengths of investors in this subreddit is the ability to see through the bullshit. Anyone remember when it hit 40 dollars? Remember how bad they wanted us to sell? They are desperately trying to gain your trust. As if we ever went to the media for our DD. Influence is power. I will never let the media influence me. Fuck the media. I trust my fellow Apes. ðŸ¤œðŸ’ŽðŸ¤›
