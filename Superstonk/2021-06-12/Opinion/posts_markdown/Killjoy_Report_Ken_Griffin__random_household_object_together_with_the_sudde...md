These memes are low effort and easy to mass produce and spam, and are being flooded into new almost as quiickly as they can be downvoted, reported and deleted by knights of new.

The Ken = random things meme in particular is a highly effective spam, as literally nothing more than a vaguely anthropomorphic object has to be labelled as Ken in order to be “valid”.

As usual memes are fun, these were funny, now however they are being mass spammed. 

The David Inggs attempt doesnt even constitute a meme. Its just the guys face with barely even a joke, and approaches the levels of mass spamming of an individual that were seen with Melissa Lee last week.

Forum sliding campaigns involving people have the added danger in that they can be used to justify shutting down Superstonk on the basis of harassment of an individual

As usual upvote funny, hilarious and original content or variations, and things which make a good point. Downvote repetitive shit that just clogs the arteries of this forum.
