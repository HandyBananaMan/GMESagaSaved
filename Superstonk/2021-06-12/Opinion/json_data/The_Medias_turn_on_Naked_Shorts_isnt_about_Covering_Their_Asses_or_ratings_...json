    "selftext": "One of the easier ways to gain a consumer\u2019s trust is acknowledging one facet of story, especially a \u201chard truth\u201d or admission of guilt, then springboarding off of that to control how the rest of the story is presented. I do it with customers. I do it with management. I do it with my crew. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to execute and it works every time. \n\nThey\u2019re essentially showing you one side of a die and lying about the 19 other sides, but you won\u2019t notice because you\u2019re impressed they were honest about one losing roll.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to learn anything new from Fox, MSNBC, etc. Avoid it. If you see something that papers those hands, remember the DD, examine it for yourself, and scroll through the comments for dissenting opinions. Sure the mods are great and the DD is a game changer, but I\u2019ve gotten more from the comments than almost anything else on the sub.",
