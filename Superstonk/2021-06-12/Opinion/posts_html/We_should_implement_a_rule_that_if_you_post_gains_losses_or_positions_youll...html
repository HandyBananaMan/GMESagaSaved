<p>pretty much what the title says. Is there a way to introduce such a rule? At this point it should be clear to EVERY APE that weâ€˜re not here to post our gains/losses nor positions, so the only ones who will want to really spread FUD will be the shills posting their sell orders so that weâ€˜re going to panic sell. </p>
