    "selftext": "Hey all, I want to be very clear that all credit for this work goes to u/jebjoya. Posting requirements did not allow him to post this, and I've been working with him in discord to get this out. This past week we've seen some weird movements with gme, and this data focuses on patterns. Specifically, a pattern that seems to show that it's possible that the 5m share offering could be completed as of Friday. None of this is financial advice, and it is meant for open discussion. \n\n# TL;DR\nThrough some simple analysis of AMC and GME stocks over the last 60 days, I have attempted to show some \u201cnatural\u201d relationship between the two. \u00a0With this relationship assumed to be true based on the evidence found, I have shown there to be some level of excess volume for GME in the morning of the 11th June (prior to 12:30pm). \u00a0This excess volume equates to a very similar number to the number of shares that GME are releasing to the market through their ATM offering. \u00a0As such, I am hypothesising that the sale of the 5m shares in an ATM offering is now complete, and that Gamestop will announce this to be the case in T+2, or AH Tuesday / PM Wednesday of next week.\n# Introduction\n## About the Author\nHi there, I\u2019m /u/jebjoya and first of all, I have exceptionally limited knowledge of the financial sector outside of the past few months. \u00a0I\u2019m in my mid-30s, have a wife and kid, work in technology consulting, and have a Masters degree in Maths from a Russell Group University in the UK (admittedly, only got a 2:2 - was too much of a fan of the pub!). \u00a0I can throw together some code, but as you\u2019ll see, I\u2019m assuredly not a developer!\nAlthough I\u2019m something of a lurker on Reddit (which is why I\u2019ve been unable to post this myself), I\u2019m a relative regular in the Discord VC rooms.\n## Where this began\nSo, in the after hours of the market on the 11th June, I was chatting with /u/ClearlyPopcornSucks and /u/Bootheskies and an article came up \u201cHow AMC Is Breaking a Meme-Stock Pattern\u201d, which I\u2019m not going to bother linking here (screw their ad revenue for writing that crap) but it got me thinking about what \u201cpattern\u201d might be shared between GME and AMC.\n# The Impetus\nSo, we can start with doing a simple visual comparison of GME and AMC - at the time, I did this with the small Yahoo Finance graphs, but let\u2019s go up a notch and code it out (since we\u2019ll be using some of this same code later).\nFirst of all, you can play along at home if you like - I\u2019m using Python 3.9 (although any 3.x version will probably work), and have pip installed yfinance, plotly, pandas and scipy - that\u2019ll probably do you. \u00a0The code for this first graph can be found here: [ATMOffering01-AMCvsGME.py](https://github.com/jebjoya/jebstonks/blob/main/ATMOffering01-AMCvsGME.py)\n(NB: Please feel free to do whatever you like with code from the jebstonks repository, it\u2019s up there with the unlicense on it - have fun, go wild.)\n[Imgur](https://imgur.com/AXmRPxn)\nJust from a rudimentary eye over this, we can see some fairly similar price action between GME and AMC from something like 12:00-13:00 until the end of the day, but the mornings look quite different - GME is moving downwards and AMC is trading pretty sideways.\nThis is all very well and good doing this by eye, but let\u2019s take it up it a notch and code it out. \u00a0We\u2019ll be using the [Pearson Correlation Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) for this, which should give us a guideline as to how related these two stocks are in their movement. \u00a0I\u2019m also going to split the day in two - the \u201cmorning\u201d or \u201cam\u201d is prior to 12:30pm, and the \u201cafternoon\u201d or \u201cpm\u201d is after 12:30pm.\nOur code is here: [ATMOffering02-Correlation.py](https://github.com/jebjoya/jebstonks/blob/main/ATMOffering02-Correlation.py) and we get a result of:\n`Morning Pearson: -0.18081255928248074` \u00a0\n`Afternoon Pearson: 0.8771973125353307`\nThis shows a clear difference in morning and afternoon - the afternoon being much more closely correlated (positively) and the morning being pretty disconnected.\n# A brief diversion into a hypothesis or two\n## AMC and GME Diverge only when there is big news\nIt was at this point that a hypothesis came to me - that the natural state of being of AMC and GME is to broadly track one another (for whatever reason), and any time that this tracking does not happen suggests some change in activity on one side or other (whether that be a squeeze, SHF fuckery or interesting company news, for instance).\nSo, let\u2019s turn this into something - I hypothesise that the days that AMC and GME track each other the *least* (per a Pearson that is closest to 0) will be days where something major has happened for one or other stock. \u00a0So, to start with, let\u2019s find the 5 most and 5 least tracking days since the 14th April (Yahoo Finance\u2019s API only provides 5m candle data for the last 60 days, and this is the earliest data possible at time of coding). \u00a0Code, as usual is available from [ATMOffering03-MostTrackingDays.py](https://github.com/jebjoya/jebstonks/blob/main/ATMOffering03-MostTrackingDays.py)\n`Least Correlated:` \u00a0\n`Date \u00a0 Pearson` \u00a0\n`28 \u00a02021-05-24 \u00a00.087472` \u00a0\n`36 \u00a02021-06-09 \u00a00.108484` \u00a0\n`11 \u00a02021-04-29 \u00a00.169620` \u00a0\n`23 \u00a02021-05-17 \u00a00.174076` \u00a0\n`16 \u00a02021-05-06 \u00a00.198065`\n`Most Correlated:` \u00a0\n`Date \u00a0 Pearson` \u00a0\n`22 \u00a02021-05-14 \u00a00.905453` \u00a0\n`31 \u00a02021-05-28 \u00a00.919137` \u00a0\n`13 \u00a02021-05-03 \u00a00.919917` \u00a0\n`29 \u00a02021-05-25 \u00a00.925267` \u00a0\n`33 \u00a02021-06-02 \u00a00.930533`\nSo our hypothesis says that the least correlated days should be ones with major events of some description. \u00a0Let\u2019s use [gmetimeline.com](https://gmetimeline.com/) and take a look - 24th May was RC\u2019s erection tweet and Lucy Komisar\u2019s AMA, 9th June was 6/9, go figure, 29th April was RC\u2019s Mr Hankey tweet and the AMA with Dr T, 17th May was RC\u2019s tweet of his Grandma and Melvin\u2019s 13F with no $GME holdings, and 6th May was the day after both dlauer\u2019s AMA and the \u201cdisappearing\u201d volume on the lowest volume day of 2021 at the time, along with it being the 3rd hearing of the House Committee on Gamestop.\nWhat do we see here? \u00a0Well, I\u2019m going to admit - this one is a bit shaky - I\u2019m going to go with this being unproven for now. \u00a0I like the fact that 6/9 was in the least correlated days, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of RC tweets on low-correlation days. \u00a0On the other hand, 6/2 was the day after DFV came back to Twitter, which perhaps feels like a \u201cbig\u201d day for GME. \u00a0I don\u2019t feel like we have *enough* at this point to prove the link, but I leave this hypothesis in here for discussion and potential extension (I\u2019ve only been looking at GME news, and not AMC news - should we look at direction, etc etc)\n## Minor Aside\nI have more recently run this again using a variant of the code above that does *not* include the absolute value of the Pearson Coefficient - this means that we\u2019re looking at the *most negative* correlation (that they\u2019re not tracking). \u00a0Most correlated remain the same, but least correlated change to:\n`Least Correlated:` \u00a0\n`Date \u00a0 Pearson` \u00a0\n`10 \u00a02021-04-28 -0.640546` \u00a0\n`5 \u00a0 2021-04-21 -0.473214` \u00a0\n`27 \u00a02021-05-21 -0.439651` \u00a0\n`17 \u00a02021-05-07 -0.351925` \u00a0\n`3 \u00a0 2021-04-19 -0.225512`\nThese dates don\u2019t exactly scream bigger news days to me than the previous set, but I add this purely to aid discussion.\n[ATMOffering03-MostTrackingDays-NONABS.py](https://github.com/jebjoya/jebstonks/blob/main/ATMOffering03-MostTrackingDays-NONABS.py)\n## Correlation in Price Action drives Correlation in Volume Spread across the Day\nThe second hypothesis, and arguably the most important one, is that I believe that the most correlated days will have correlated volume across the day as well. \u00a0In particular, I\u2019m going to be looking at pre-12:30 vs post-12:30 volume for each of the 5 most correlated days to see whether they look similar. \u00a0Code is here [ATMOffering04-VolumeCorrelationTest.py](https://github.com/jebjoya/jebstonks/blob/main/ATMOffering04-VolumeCorrelationTest.py) and output is:\n`Date: 2021-05-14 GME: 0.6969832013569681 AMC: 0.7186096861005629` \u00a0\n`Date: 2021-05-28 GME: 0.701353007190714 AMC: 0.717350901193812` \u00a0\n`Date: 2021-05-03 GME: 0.6604088618964389 AMC: 0.6767881287420806` \u00a0\n`Date: 2021-05-25 GME: 0.3190856955418446 AMC: 0.4060525168801743` \u00a0\n`Date: 2021-06-02 GME: 0.5112048987969748 AMC: 0.5640133520495791`\nThe numbers here are showing the ratio of volume that happens before 12:30 to the whole day. \u00a0As we can see, when the two stocks are highly correlated (which I hypothesise to be the \u201cnatural state\u201d of them, but was unable to fully demonstrate above), the volume pre- and post-12:30 broadly correlate as well.\n# Back to Friday\nSo, I\u2019ve shown to a limited extent that volume appears to track where the stock price tracks, and I am *suggesting* (but, again, have not been able to fully demonstrate) that this is the natural state of GME and AMC.\nSo, what do I suggest we do with that information? \u00a0Well, let\u2019s go back to Friday\u2019s data. \u00a0We can see that the afternoon has a high level of correlation (0.87, almost on a par with the 0.90 of the 5th most correlated day), and the morning a crap correlation (0.18 - worse than the 0.19 on the 5th least correlated day). \u00a0I\u2019ve also suggested that when correlated, the stock has similar volume. \u00a0What I am suggesting is that the lack of correlation on Friday morning was caused by excess shares being loaded into the market, causing a deviation from the AMC baseline and downward trend.\nHow do we work out what the excess is? \u00a0Easy really - check the percentage of AMC volume that happened in the morning vs afternoon, assume the afternoons should broadly match, and work out what the morning *should* have been for GME if tracking.\nCode is here [ATMOffering05-ExcessVolumeCalculation.py](https://github.com/jebjoya/jebstonks/blob/main/ATMOffering05-ExcessVolumeCalculation.py)\nAnd the results:\n`AMC Ratio: 0.37143463487609085` \u00a0\n`GME PM Volume: 5574831` \u00a0\n`AMC Implied Total Volume for GME: 8869134.873349302` \u00a0\n`Excess Volume for GME: 6420225.1266506985`\nWe can see an implied excess volume in the morning for GME of 6.42 million shares. \u00a0Obviously higher volatility breeds higher volume due to HFTs, but this 6.42m is surprisingly close to the 5m share ATM offering that Gamestop announced earlier this week.",
