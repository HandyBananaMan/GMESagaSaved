Personally I would like us all to keep politics out of this. The article from fox has people talking alot of politics, and I would say that's the biggest divider among people. 

Bringing it up does not help GameStop nor the moass. 

Bring it up can only get us divided. 

Honestly is a clear attempt at fud, as we have seen, dividing out community is their plan. 

Lastly, all politicians are fucking stupid, so why should we spend our time on a stock subreddit talking about them. 

If you mean I'm wrong just down vote, I just don't wanna see us getting angry at each other over politics. 

Have a nice weekend.

Edit: Firstly thanks for all the awards. And second remember ape fights no ape.
