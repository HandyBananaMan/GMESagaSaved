Some of you apes are naive as fuck. I’m seeing more and more posts praising Fox and Charles Payne (among others) for being on retail’s side. 

Make no fucking mistake, the moment GME hits $1000 a share, the same people are going to urge you to sell claiming the “squeeze has squoze.”

It’s just safer to 100% disregard what  ANY media has to say about the GME saga, be it positive or negative. 

Fuck MSM scum. Apes together strong. 

This is not financial advice. I personally buy and hodl and keep my motherfucking head low.

Edit: Since this seems to be gaining traction. Some apes are making valid points. It really IS great that some of the HF fuckery is finally being exposed. I am NOT against that. All I’m saying is, be very careful of who you decide to trust. This is obviously way bigger than any one of us or even MSM itself. I personally trust the DD. I trust RC and I trust apes. So better safe than sorry. 

Power to the players.
