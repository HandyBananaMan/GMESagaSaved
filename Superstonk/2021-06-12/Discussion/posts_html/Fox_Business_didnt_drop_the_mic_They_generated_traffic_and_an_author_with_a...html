<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxu0y3/i_was_not_prepared_for_fox_news_to_drop_the_mic/">post on the front page</a> linking to a story at Fox Business that rails against big money is an interesting read, and on the very thin surface is getting apes to think "They're finally listening!". To an extent they are, but not in the way that you're hoping. And it's not a political hit piece this time.</p>
<p>If you look toward the top of the piece and just to the left of the by-line you will see the first clue:  "OPINION". It's how MSM more or less disowns the content. </p>
<p>Why, then, would they allow content that is so incendiary about big money if they are also tightly tangled with it? More money, of course. As we are "the product" in the ubiquitous cliche, they are driving traffic to their site and it's well known that apes are ever hungry for confirmation bias. Clicks are valuable. Impressions are valuable.</p>
<p>Also consider the end of the article where it discloses <em>why</em> she wrote the article:  "Carol Roth is a former investment banker, entrepreneur, and author of the forthcoming book "The War on Small Business" (Broadside Books, June 29,  2021)". Ms. Roth appears to be on a promotional tour and a firecracker of an article like this that is released Friday night like how bad news or bad employees are released on a Friday.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to go down the rabbit hole of why GameStop is in the headline but only AMC is mentioned in the article, be my guest.  Outside of that, this is just another greed-driven article written about a greed-driven market. </p>
<p>The article still raises some eyebrows otherwise, but just understand the motivations behind the why and when.</p>
