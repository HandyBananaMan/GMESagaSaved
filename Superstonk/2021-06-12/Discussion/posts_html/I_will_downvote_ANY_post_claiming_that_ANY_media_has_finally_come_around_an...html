<p>Some of you apes are naive as fuck. I’m seeing more and more posts praising Fox and Charles Payne (among others) for being on retail’s side. </p>
<p>Make no fucking mistake, the moment GME hits $1000 a share, the same people are going to urge you to sell claiming the “squeeze has squoze.”</p>
<p>It’s just safer to 100% disregard what  ANY media has to say about the GME saga, be it positive or negative. </p>
<p>Fuck MSM scum. Apes together strong. </p>
<p>This is not financial advice. I personally buy and hodl and keep my motherfucking head low.</p>
<p>Edit: Since this seems to be gaining traction. Some apes are making valid points. It really IS great that some of the HF fuckery is finally being exposed. I am NOT against that. All I’m saying is, be very careful of who you decide to trust. This is obviously way bigger than any one of us or even MSM itself. I personally trust the DD. I trust RC and I trust apes. So better safe than sorry. </p>
<p>Power to the players.</p>
