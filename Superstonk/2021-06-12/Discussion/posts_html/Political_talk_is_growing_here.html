<p>Personally I would like us all to keep politics out of this. The article from fox has people talking alot of politics, and I would say that's the biggest divider among people. </p>
<p>Bringing it up does not help GameStop nor the moass. </p>
<p>Bring it up can only get us divided. </p>
<p>Honestly is a clear attempt at fud, as we have seen, dividing out community is their plan. </p>
<p>Lastly, all politicians are fucking stupid, so why should we spend our time on a stock subreddit talking about them. </p>
<p>If you mean I'm wrong just down vote, I just don't wanna see us getting angry at each other over politics. </p>
<p>Have a nice weekend.</p>
<p>Edit: Firstly thanks for all the awards. And second remember ape fights no ape.</p>
