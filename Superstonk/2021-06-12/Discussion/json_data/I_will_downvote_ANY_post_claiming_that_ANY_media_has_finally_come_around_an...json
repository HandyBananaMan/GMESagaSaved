    "selftext": "Some of you apes are naive as fuck. I\u2019m seeing more and more posts praising Fox and Charles Payne (among others) for being on retail\u2019s side. \n\nMake no fucking mistake, the moment GME hits $1000 a share, the same people are going to urge you to sell claiming the \u201csqueeze has squoze.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just safer to 100% disregard what  ANY media has to say about the GME saga, be it positive or negative. \n\nFuck MSM scum. Apes together strong. \n\nThis is not financial advice. I personally buy and hodl and keep my motherfucking head low.\n\nEdit: Since this seems to be gaining traction. Some apes are making valid points. It really IS great that some of the HF fuckery is finally being exposed. I am NOT against that. All I\u2019m saying is, be very careful of who you decide to trust. This is obviously way bigger than any one of us or even MSM itself. I personally trust the DD. I trust RC and I trust apes. So better safe than sorry. \n\nPower to the players.",
