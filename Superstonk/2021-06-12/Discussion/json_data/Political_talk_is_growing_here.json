    "selftext": "Personally I would like us all to keep politics out of this. The article from fox has people talking alot of politics, and I would say that's the biggest divider among people. \n\nBringing it up does not help GameStop nor the moass. \n\nBring it up can only get us divided. \n\nHonestly is a clear attempt at fud, as we have seen, dividing out community is their plan. \n\nLastly, all politicians are fucking stupid, so why should we spend our time on a stock subreddit talking about them. \n\nIf you mean I'm wrong just down vote, I just don't wanna see us getting angry at each other over politics. \n\nHave a nice weekend.\n\nEdit: Firstly thanks for all the awards. And second remember ape fights no ape.",
