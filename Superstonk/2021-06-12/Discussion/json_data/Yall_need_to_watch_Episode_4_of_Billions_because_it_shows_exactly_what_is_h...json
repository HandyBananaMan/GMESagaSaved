    "selftext": "I just started watching billions recently and I'm super surprised that there isn't more references in this sub with memes and other stuff.\n\nIt's essentially about a war between a US attorney (played by Paul giamatti) and a billionaire hedge fund manager (played by Damien Lewis) with all the spicey drugs sex and violence that goes on in that world.\n\nBut anyway, in episode 4, Bobby Axelrod (Damien Lewis) is short squeezed when other whales realise he's short on a position, and it follows his attempts to get out of the position so he doesn't get fucked. It's really interesting because you can tell that whoever wrote the episode knew what they were doing, even down to when Bobby rings somebody to borrow shares, sound familiar?\n\nOh and also... The simulation is confirmed because - and I shit you not - whales, apes, and flying to the moon are all referenced in that episode within the space of about 5 minutes. I'm sorry, but you can't chance that. Especially when this episode came out like, 5 years ago.\n\nTits. Are. Jacked.",
