THE GAME STOPPED ....with RC (did you see what I did there\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlh9i888uaz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=352c5e13b135a1c54ad374b571e900bc5e596021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/155ao20buaz61.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=486d794efec06177c9e077ede69cbf89c8a5ffe1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0gjsxscuaz61.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=893b4c1250467a5d539640c7d7c10a3e26eb672b\n\nSo he went Full 2Pac on them and pitched slapped the Board, the CEO, the company and its directions.\n\nThey probably will hate him forever and never want to work with him....\n\n**PSHYCH ...they made him Chairman**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8mycywhvaz61.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=89ba38f06db680c7da4000e17c51cde1cad655f3\n\nON 6/9/2021 Ryan will be the Chairman and have full control of a 6 member board of directors.....a board of directors that he bent over his knew and spanked 8 months earlier.......\n\nThen he can do this [Reverse Merger](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n7bv2h/ryan_cohens_kill_shotthe_reverse_merger/) or any merger or expansion on June, and announce the vote totals ect...\n\nTHIS GUY FUCKS\n\nOh and Ryan Cohen based his whole CHEWY business plan and business model off of this letter than Jeff Bezos wrote in 1997\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312513151836/d511111dex991.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312513151836/d511111dex991.htm)\n\nWhat do you think will happen when Ryan Cohen harnesses the full power of the Gamestop customer base.....Customers who are esports participants, customers who are game designers and developers, customers who are influencers ....ect ect.  The complete switch to a customer focused and customer driven company is going to be MIND NUMBING.....and GAMESTOP already has a HUGE brand.\n\n**TLDR- I believe in RC, DFV believed in RC....RC is the reason GME is happening.  The business transformation is going to be written about for years......oh and the squeeze is nice too**\n\n  [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DrHCqaXvpzM#menu](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DrHCqaXvpzM#menu)",
