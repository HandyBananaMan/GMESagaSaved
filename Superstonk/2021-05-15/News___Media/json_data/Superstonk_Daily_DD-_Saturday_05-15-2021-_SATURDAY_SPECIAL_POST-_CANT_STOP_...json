At the request of a business colleague, I have coffee with a lawyer from Texas who tells me that a problem was about to blow up the financial markets: Wall Street brokers are using short sales and fails to deliver to grab the assets of American entrepreneurs. I feel a pang of guilt for not sticking it out to fix this before I left DTC in 1993. By 2003, it was a full-blown regulatory crisis!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Napkin Story**\n\n*\"One afternoon \\[in late 2003\\], my boss tells me he has just come from lunch with an old friend, Gary Jewell, a Houston-based lawyer. Gary said that he was in New York looking for someone who understands post-trade clearing and settlement, possibly someone who may have worked at the DTC. My boss recognizes the company name as part of my past work experience. He asks me to meet Gary over coffee. The two of them had run marathons in their younger days and my boss presents it to me as doing him a favor. Gary brought Wes Christian to that casual meeting.*\n\n*James \"Wes\" Christian, is a Senior Partner at Christian, Smith, & Jewell in Houston. If not for Wes, I may not ever have become aware that the crack in the system Ray Riley brought to me in 1993 was becoming a gaping chasm in 2003. Wes was born, raised, and educated in Texas. He comes complete with a pleasant drawl that belies his non-nonsense approach to the matter. Wes would lead a team of 65 lawyers as he eventually uncovered more than 1,200 hedge fund and offshore accounts working through more than 150 broker-dealers to strip mall and medium size public companies of their value.\"*\\- Dr. Susanne Trimbath, Naked Short and Greedy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are so honored, humbled, and thrilled to bring you these top-tier AMA guests!

The momentum has picked up, our bias has officially been confirmed, we know this is a matter of *wen* we moon, not if... all thanks to the overwhelming growth we've seen in the last couple of weeks and our amazing mod team. This is real, and you should feel confident in that as you peruse the sub, or as you interact with the people in your everyday life. *The only way the shorts get out of this like they always do, is by driving the company to bankruptcy like they always do.* **And don't forget that GME paid off all its long term debt a couple weeks ago.** Bankruptcy is *completely* off the table.
