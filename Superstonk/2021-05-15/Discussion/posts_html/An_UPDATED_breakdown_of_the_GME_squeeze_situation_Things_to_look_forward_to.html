<p>For those who are trying to piece things together, and get a broad overview of the whole GME situation, I have put this post together to highlight important events that have taken place recently, as well as to point out some things to potentially look forward to. Others have done the real DD, and this is simply an attempt to organize the important points.</p>
<p><strong>I am not a financial advisor, none of this is financial advice, and I encourage you to do your own research on all of these topics / any trade that you decide to make.</strong> I am simply presenting information that I have found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Throughout the post you will see me say multiple times, "People are saying..."   or   "We have seen...". When I say this, I am not talking about what people on the street are saying, I am talking about good solid DD that you can read about each of these topics. (Sorry for not linking to other relevant DD, but you'll find them if you are interested in digging deeper)</p>
<p><strong>Here are the important things to know / look into further.</strong></p>
<h1>GameStop company value increasing</h1>
<ul>
<li>175% Increase in online sales in quarter 4, compared to previous year. These online sales accounted for 34% of their net sales, as compared to 12% in the previous year, meaning that the online sales "pie slice", almost tripled</li>
<li>11% Increase in sales for January, as compared to previous year</li>
<li>Ryan Cohen announced as new chairman of GameStop (He will become the chairman after the company's annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for June 9). Ryan Cohen not only knows how to make an online business thrive / explode, but he is young and knows what gamers like, which means that he will soon transform GameStop into, "The Amazon of Gaming"</li>
<li>New board members from HUGE companies (Google, Amazon, Chewy, and more)</li>
<li>GameStop now sells computers / computer parts, game chairs, TVs and other electronics, and more</li>
<li>GameStop payed off $216.4 million in debt. In addition to this showing a solid financial situation for the company, this gives GameStop the ability to give dividends, and commence a share recall or audit. Dividends, a share recall, or a share audit, may have the potential to put pressure on hedge funds, and cause them to buy back their shares</li>
<li>GameStop gained $551 million by selling shares, to speed up their e-commerce transformation</li>
<li>GameStop expanded their fulfillment network by leasing a new 700,000 square foot fulfillment center</li>
<li>*Don't forget that lots of people like disc-based games too. Personally, every other store in my town that sells disc-based games is far inferior to GameStop</li>
</ul>
<h1>Possible catalysts / Big news</h1>
<ul>
<li>We are awaiting the GME shareholder vote count. We expect to see many more votes than the number of shares that are supposed to exist, which will prove that hedge funds have been manipulating the stock, and will give GameStop the ability to recall / audit shares... causing the shares to be covered / causing the squeeze to start.</li>
<li>New SEC rules being put into place. These are rules that can make hedge funds finally pay what they owe (i.e. Buy back shares / start the squeeze) People are waiting for these rules to take effect.</li>
<li>Time itself: As the price continues to rise / refuses to fall, and as hedge funds pay more interest + spend more and more to short the stock, they become more and more overleveraged, and closer to getting margin called regardless of big catalysts. At some point the people who lent to hedge funds are going to want their shares / money back, pure and simple. You can't just keep taking out infinite loans without extra collateral forever</li>
<li>On the first day that GameStop was able to see the vote count, GameStop tweeted a picture of an astronaut drinking a beer on the moon, and replied to people with many bullish comments... then the next day GameStop advertised "Mass Effect" and replied with a comment that has now been deleted: *moass* effect. That's right, they tweeted about the mother of all short squeezes! Shortly after Ryan Cohen tweets a picture of himself at a GameStop in Arlington VA, which is VERY close to Washington. Some people think that Ryan Cohen may have shared the vote count with the SEC by now.</li>
<li>*GameStop acknowledged the possibility of a short squeeze in their earnings report</li>
<li>*Fidelity shows that 5 times as many people are buying GME, as those who are selling</li>
</ul>
<h1>Shills / insight into the other side</h1>
<p>I believe it helps to get insight into what the other side is doing, as it makes me realize how real the situation is.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have seen many apes claiming (and providing proof) that they were contacted by people who tried to get them to post negativity about the stock</li>
<li>We have seen overwhelming amounts of articles that say to "Forget GameStop", and lots of other articles that appear to be desperately trying to get people to sell or buy into other stocks</li>
<li>We see articles that make incredibly good news look like bad news, or otherwise we do not see the good news written about at all</li>
<li>We see blatant price drops / short attacks right after very good news</li>
<li>We have seen a video of Jim Cramer in 2006 bragging about the same dirty tactics that the hedge funds are using now to drive (manipulate) the price down, where he was literally saying that he encourages others to use the same techniques</li>
</ul>
<h1>But what if someone stops the squeeze?</h1>
<p>Nobody knows what will happen, but I have heard two supporting statements in reply to this question that I want to mention here.</p>
<ul>
<li>People have mentioned that the government stands to gain trillions of dollars in capital gains tax, not to mention the benefit of trillions of dollars being given back to the people / pumped into the economy</li>
<li>People have mentioned how at this point, when so many people have purchased GameStop including large institutions as well as international investors... doing something to stop the squeeze instead of letting the market operate as it should, would cause widespread distrust for the American market, not just for retail traders but for big financial institutions too</li>
<li>In addition, some people are saying that the SEC, DTCC, etc. are actively preparing for the squeeze to happen, and rather than planning to stop it, are putting things in place to keep innocent people safe from the fallout</li>
</ul>
<h1>A world wide event: We are not alone</h1>
<ul>
<li>There are billboards and traffic signs that support holding GameStop stock, which shows how big this thing really is</li>
<li>There are huge institutions involved on the long side (Such as perhaps BlackRock). Don't feel like retail is alone on this one. Some big guys have skin in the game / want the squeeze too</li>
<li>DFV exercised his options, AND bought 50k more shares at market price, and now he holds 200k shares</li>
<li>Ryan Cohen also owns 9 million + shares</li>
<li>Institutional ownership of GME is 200% or more of the float</li>
<li>It is believed that retail traders own 100% or more of the float</li>
</ul>
<h1>All shorts must cover</h1>
<p>When it comes down to it, all shorts must cover, and hedge funds have not done so yet.</p>
<p>Hedge funds have shorted WAY more shares than are available in the float, which kicks the can down the road, but digs the hole deeper.</p>
