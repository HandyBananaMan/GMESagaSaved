<p>Ok so I know this is a long shot. Why? Michael Burry deleted twitter and he doesn’t want to give any motive to the SEC or anyone to come knocking on his door. </p>
<p>But would he be interested to be interviewed by one of the leading journalists of all time? Why shouldn’t a prominent mind be allowed to speak without being afraid of harrassmeny from authorities? </p>
<p>It’s just a pipe dream and obviously something all parties have to agree to. But I think it is something that we maybe should at least try to make some noise about.</p>
