<p>GME millionaires will be mostly your average people. Most probably don't come from money. Most probably working a dead end job just to survive. GME millionaires will be the people who give back to their communities, help out kids or adults who are struggling to get by. The world will have never seen anything like what GME holders will give back after the MOASS, mark my words.</p>
