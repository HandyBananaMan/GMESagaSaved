Ok so I know this is a long shot. Why? Michael Burry deleted twitter and he doesn’t want to give any motive to the SEC or anyone to come knocking on his door. 

But would he be interested to be interviewed by one of the leading journalists of all time? Why shouldn’t a prominent mind be allowed to speak without being afraid of harrassmeny from authorities? 

It’s just a pipe dream and obviously something all parties have to agree to. But I think it is something that we maybe should at least try to make some noise about.
