#Title: Something people are forgetting: If there is more than 100% of the float shorted, when HF buys a share, it doesn't back into the float and create more liquidity. It gets cancelled against a naked short/synthetic share.

I have this weird feeling that people think paperhands are going to create enough liquidity that more shares can be bought/sold/rebought/resold by HF and get out of their massive short position, little by little. Nope. They need to cancel out each naked short/synthetic share. Every share they buy will get cancelled out. AND, when that's done, they need to re-buy a ratio of the 'real' shares they shorted. They are truly fucked even if just r/Superstonk apes HODL. Think. Please. The shares need to be cancelled, not just rebought. Relax. We got this. Buy. HODL. Vote.
