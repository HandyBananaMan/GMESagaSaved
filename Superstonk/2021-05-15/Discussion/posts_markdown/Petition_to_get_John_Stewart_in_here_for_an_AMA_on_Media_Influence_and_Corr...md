I have been a fan of Jon Stewart for a very long time. The man is articulate, hilarious, inquisitive, and from what I have seen, all about the little ape. He has interviewed hundreds of important and powerful people, asked hard-hitting questions, and generally refuses to back down. Imagine the wealth of information he could provide! 

Obviously, this process starts by asking apes if it is something they would be interested in, and if it is, it would be up to the mods to decide if it is appropriate. THEN someape would have to try to get ahold of him to see if he would even be up for it. Maybe it's just a pipe dream, or maybe I don't know as much about his character as I thought I did, but I figured I'd at least put the idea out there for apes to discuss. After all, it is these very discussions that have gotten us this far!

What say you, fellow apes?

E: John-->Jon. Can't change the title though. Stoopid auto-correct.
