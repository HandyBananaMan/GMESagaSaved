    "selftext": "One of the first posts I saw this morning was from r/relationships by a 2hr old account with a post from 2 hours ago. \n\nTo summarize, it\u2019s a story about how her excited bf blew joint savings \u00a39000 to buy 50 shares and she\u2019s upset because xyz.  They brought it into a legal sub as well but mod was good there\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/nd04nh/my_partner_used_our_mortgage_savings_to_buy_about/gy7y8hq/\n\nAt first I thought it was just to get others to hate Apes but now I believe it\u2019s meant to create divisions within the sub. I\u2019m expecting it to be used in forum slide and that shills will try to create in fighting by stoking both sides of \u201cthe argument\u201d\n\nSecondary objective is probably to drag apes into the wild of Reddit where we are easily painted as assholes or crazies (possibly as a gambit to help get us shut down). If you do decide to engage anything like this, tread very carefully and keep a civil tone. \n\nStay vigilant. Every day we\u2019re getting closer to the moon. \n\n\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf14\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\ude90\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: I guess the post was removed from uk legal. May have been done by mod as they said it belonged in a different sub \n\nhttps://www.removeddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/nd04nh/my_partner_used_our_mortgage_savings_to_buy_about/\n\nEdit 2:  Was reminded \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b media sources love jumping on this kind of generated conflict as divisive clickbait.\n\nEdit 3:  Thank you for all the awards! I\u2019m just glad I could make a positive contribution.",
