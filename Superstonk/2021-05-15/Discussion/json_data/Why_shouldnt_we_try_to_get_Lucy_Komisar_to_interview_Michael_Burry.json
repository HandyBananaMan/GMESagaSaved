Michael Burry deleted twitter and he doesn\u2019t want to give any motive to the SEC or anyone to come knocking on his door. \n\nBut would he be interested to be interviewed by one of the leading journalists of all time? Why shouldn\u2019t a prominent mind be allowed to speak without being afraid of harrassmeny from authorities? \n\nIt\u2019s just a pipe dream and obviously something all parties have to agree to. But I think it is something that we maybe should at least try to make some noise about.",
