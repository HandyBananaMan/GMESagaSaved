YouTube is a business. Think of all the financial gurus on there that tell you a bunch of crap and only a few of them are honest about YouTube being their main source of income. 

These new channels rising up over GME and others stocks are in it for building up an audience quickly and to get more views. You should not put your faith and trust in them nor watch what they do during the MOASS. They also can be bought. This is what Cramer's career on Television is. This is what they do.


Edit: Obviously **not everyone** on YouTube is this way. I'm just saying be careful and don't trust blindly just because someone says things you want to hear.

Edit2:. Oh shit Warden Elite.... Lmao just got his AdSense and that's all he was wanting
