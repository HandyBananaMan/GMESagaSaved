    "selftext": "I am not a seasoned Reddit Vet... Nor do I have much karma... Or even experience in Stonks!!!!!  But... I can easily see what is going on here and in the entire world\n\nIn my opinion... Burry was the \"Needle\"... Cohen is the \"Thread\"... Gill was the \"Knot\"... A perfect fucking \"Combo\" honestly!!!!!\n\nIf you can say \"this is not financial advice\" with a straight fucking face... And then have enough \"common sense\" that individuals such as stated do not do what they do... I order to FAIL!!!!!  IT IS NOT AN OPTION!!!!!\n\nAdd that shit to the FOREVER growing GME community... Sprinkle in some of this extremely enlightening DD... On top of just simple facts as to where GME stands currently and their future plans... You can EASLIY see what is to come in the future of GME in the E-commerce world!!!!!\n\nJust a couple small/HUGE things to ponder... We all know what is coming... Just about everyone knows what is coming... Follow the \"common sense\" of all this and have patience during this ride!!!!!\n\nQuoting Tommy Armour the Legendary Golf Pro...\n\n\"You have to enjoy the struggle.\"  Meaning... It is within those moments we \"truly\" find what is needed to grow\n\nEDIT: \ud83e\udd8dVoted \u2611\n\nEDIT 2: A valid point on Burry selling his positions on GME... What I am referring to is more... The ability to see what others cannot... Amazingly coincidental and no pun intended... What he has predicted etc... He is about the \"Fundamental Principles\" of how it works... I do not personally think he was in it for the fame of fortune\n\nEDIT 3:  THIS IS JUST MY OPINION APE'S... NOT TELLING \"ANYONE\" WHAT TO DO FOR ALL YOU THAT KEEP COMMENTING THAT.  CARRY ON!!!!!  AS THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!!!!!\n\nEDIT 4: THANK YOU FOR THE AWARDS!!!!!",
