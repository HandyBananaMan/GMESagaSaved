<p><strong>A little foreword:</strong></p>
<p>Dear apes, this is my third day of providing you with a daily hit of news, I am loving it! These posts are snowballing and gaining lots of views so I just want to say something:</p>
<p>I aim to provide you pure news - no drama, little opinion and DD in a dense but structured way, all credits will be given to rightful authors/posters. Little to no content I post is actually mine. I am like a hermit that collects posts obsessively. I then compile them into one big medi-ape approved post. I emphasise being a medi-ape because I have to filter through walls of text for key information on a daily basis. I practically do the same when posting here, it's not different from the MSc I am currently undertaking. I am far more passionate about writing news in comparison to writing dissertations and studies, and I thank you apes for enjoying and appreciating what I am doing!</p>
<p>Please save the money on the awards and spend it on the stock or in store. And to everyone who is commenting, upvoting and keeping this a positive and happy sub, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart! I adore this community and I really care about each and every one of you!</p>

<p>Here is an extract:</p>
<p><em>"The main purpose of this work is to help wrinkle-lemited apes in understanding and learning important principles of technical analysis, in the process of elaborating on the current market conditions, and how these are relevant to GME technically. As it was mentioned in the post title, the tools that were used for creating this TA on SPY include: market cycles analysis, for setting a suitable framework; Elliot waves theory as a method of ordering major market movements; Fibonacci retracement for identifying the key, magnetic support and resistance levels; and a sweet 150 moving average to predict the potential bottom of the bear market. "</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thunder12123/"><strong>u/thunder12123</strong></a>  <strong>has written:</strong></p>
<p><em>"Lets look at TSLA. 52 week high is $900.40 per share. in August 2020 they did a 5 to 1 split. if you bought in before the split/squeeze, say in june 2020 for under $160, your 1 share turned into 5 shares worth $900.40 each or $4470 on your $160 investment. TSLA had a short interest of approximately 20%. TSLA had its first ever profitable year in 2019.</em></p>
<p><em>Now lets look at Volkswagen. Volkswagen squeezed to $1000 a share with only 12% short interest. Yes, Porsche bought a significant amount of the float.</em></p>
<p><em>Now on to GME. We know it was shorted over 140%. If the squeeze was in January and only went to $483 per share that doesn't make sense to me. First because comparing to TSLA and Volkswagen that were both shorted significantly less but when it passes 100% it comes down to supply and demand and can theoretically go to infinity. So with a short % that can go into the realm of infinity, given that everyone diamond hands, it "squeezed" less than TSLA and Volkswagen when it was shorted 7x more?</em></p>
<p><em>I hear the argument that Volkswagen and GME aren't similar because Porsche bought up most of the float. they ARE similar because retail bought up most of the float. We are the Porsche factor here.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>THE NUMBERS DONT ADD UP</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Comparing to other short squeezes this thing is an atom bomb</em> <strong><em>THAT HASNT GONE OFF YET</em></strong>*. The numbers don't add up. There is some seriously shady manipulation going on to suppress price and* <strong><em>HIDE VOLUME</em></strong>*. Likely they were doing this through options which has now ceased due to new DTCC rules. Now they are doing this in OTC which we already know. Bottom line is THE PRICE IS WRONG BITCH. HODL  "*</p>

<p><em>If I'm not mistaken those are the banks that are making the news lately for various reasons. Cutting credit limits, Margin Calls, liquidation, etc."</em></p>
