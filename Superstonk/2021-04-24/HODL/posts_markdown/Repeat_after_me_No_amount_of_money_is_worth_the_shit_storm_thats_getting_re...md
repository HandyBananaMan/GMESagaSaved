Drill that through your head. DO NOT SELL. HOLD YOUR SHARES. 

\- You are most likely going to see price dip before a short squeeze. You may see this thing come down to 100$ before it lifts off. DO NOT SELL. 

This is not financial advice....I literally can't read a candlestick chart and I've gambled all my ex-wifes money on GME.
