    "selftext": "*(clears throat) \"ehem !\"*\n\nFirst of all: Many thanks for all the great feedback you freaking apes gave me on my [initial DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/) on r/GME. As some time *(around 1 month)* has passed and we have some new apes and apettes on board and some new information around my initial assumptions has been updated and revealed, I have decided to work on an updated version of my initial DD. So let's start right away, main changes are as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# UPDATE 24th April:\n\nThe release of [GME's proxy statement](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/18846/html) revealed some new figures around the floating shares. Using figures from their 14A, we end up with around **26.6m remaining floating shares**. (Please note that there are [some approaches that calculate with an even lower number of floating shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxu7lj/gme_float_is_less_than_161m_and_retail_owns_more/), but lets stay conservative here). Credits to [u/thr0wthis4ccount4way](https://www.reddit.com/user/thr0wthis4ccount4way/) for putting this all together in a great [overview post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/mxa8gy/everything_you_need_to_know_about_14a_proxy/). Also check out the subreddit this is posted in for some high-quality DD.\n\nIn addition to number of floating shares I have updated and added a lot of brokers to get a more and more precise picture of the total retail situation. I dont trust Bloomberg terminal in any way regarding individual ownership as numbers are heavily distored due to this fuckload of synthetic shares being around.\n\n**Following brokers have been added since my first post:**\n\n* Saxo Bank,\n* Lynx,\n* Freedom 24,\n* Hatch,\n* Nordnet,\n* Avanza,\n* FP Markets,\n* Questrade,\n* Sharesies,\n* Stake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Following brokers have been identified as missing in my DD, but do not provide public information about user numbers:**\n\n* OnVista,\n* Consorsbank,\n* TD Canade Trust,\n* CashApp,\n* RBC,\n* Passfolio,\n* Firstrade,\n* TradeStation,\n* Citibank Brokerage\n   * Basically all major 'banks' that offer investment accounts.\n\n**Important: If you are investing with on of the abovementioned brokers, please reach out to them and ask about the total number of investment accounts (or even better about total number of users investing in $GME).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Enough blah blah, lets dive into the (updated) DD:\n\nOkay fellow apes, listen up, here is some ~~fresh~~ **updated** DD straight out of the oven to feed your confirmation bias. \ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[tell me more about how you covered your shorts...](https://preview.redd.it/jb0ci8upv5v61.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0254afd39d417b4e9e7477e90ce0ff6c31d9cc82)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a screenshot taken today (24th April) from **eToro**:\n\n[Seems like we like stock, huh?](https://preview.redd.it/fjr101zt06v61.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee9cdeba51324ceae1c4a7a570986cb42cea0999)\n\nNot to mention all the posts and screenshots from other investment brokers reporting GME as their current top traded stock for the past month(s):\n\n[RBC statement for the month of March](https://preview.redd.it/umoi949rw9v61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=c863c1172d6f7e77bff79d71f255d3d3cb2b3763)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[selfwealth community checking in ! Thanks u\\/Chabkraken for sending this screenshot ! ](https://preview.redd.it/ag5wbtxwy9v61.png?width=379&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeda81cdea380f7c243d0490d31426f7058a31e5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Europoors doing our part over here !](https://preview.redd.it/15efd2y06av61.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfa03e15a6fa7958a36fd0dfc281a1906f7c83f6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fidelity checking in !](https://preview.redd.it/6ivowv9n6av61.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff31a8a41e079fc06f3349377e86e878472e9f94)\n\nSo i thought to myself, why don't we  take this percentage from eToro and try to get an estimation about how many apes in total are holding GME right now and see where some variables regarding  shares per ape get us. Are you exicted? Because **I AM**, LETS GO! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI spent the last ~~hour(s)~~ weeks or so researching the largest broker firms and gathered their total user numbers. This list is **by far not complete** which means that the % held by retail investors could be **way way (!)** higher than my estimates. Please let me know if you have access to more brokers data and i will update my list.\n\nSome friendly ape posted a statement from neo-broker Wealthsimple, thats states a GME-ownership of [up to 14%](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/gme-data)  (!) of their total users. Therefore I made assumptions regarding the  share of users that invested in GME for each broker. For neo-brokers  like eToro, Robinhood, Revolut and WeBull I went with an average of 10%  GME ownership of all users. (*Also included a scenario for only 5% GME-ownership for neo-broker, as some apes raised concerns that my 10% assumption may be too far on the optimistic side. Considering eToro stats i am more likely to lean on my 10% assumption, but in order to deliver a differentiated view, have your 5% scenario)*\n\nOf  course we have to consider that the average eToro/neo-broker user might have a  higher risk tolerance and is more likely to invest in GME compared to the average boomer investor. So for 'classic' brokers that are more known for \"passive  investing\" like Vanguard or Schwab I went with a lower share of users  that are invested in GameStop. Some brokers from the Nordics report an ownership of [around 1.5% - 2.0%](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/grebfmc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of their users, so lets go with 1.5% for the classic brokerages.\n\nOkay, now that we have a vague feeling of how many GME retail investors we are, lets play with some scenarios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scenario 1: GME-ownership of 5% for neo-brokers and 1.5% for classic investment platforms:**\n\n[&#37; of remaining float that is held by retail \\(Scenario 1\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ajfhd4ij5av61.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=869e246cbb4d59b58c7eaa1a4a937fab0ddbad5c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scenario 2: GME-ownership of 10% for neo-brokers and 1.5% for classic investment platforms:**\n\n[&#37; of remaining float that is held by retail \\(Scenario 2\\)](https://preview.redd.it/t7r6qb3c5av61.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=778deb3aae10b2e804ce8737053a8146bb897904)\n\nAs you guys can see, even with our lowest assumptions we easily land in the +100% ballpark. And consider that this list does not contain all of the existing stock brokers or banks that offer investment accounts! Real numbers should be way way higher!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/49ewa7zhc6v61.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=04278dd26bc661681ff5309a3a460ce172d8aaea)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso keep in mind that we have some huge individual whales among us, talking about u/DeepFuckingValue, u/HeyItsPixel, u/xeisu, u/Spielporn and many many more who hold xxxx shares.\n\nOh no ! Looks like poor Kenny has to buy back our shares **multiple times now....  Anyway!**\n\n[retail whale has entered the chat](https://preview.redd.it/dnlupxapc6v61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=abac0532067c75ce8b4420dfd6e4ca435c19bf69)\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If you have  access to more detailed data regarding number of users or even  GME-ownership for a specific broker, please let me know via dm. There  are too many comments here and it's hard to keep track of all of them.  And please add your source (link or screenshot) so I can publish this  here as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHIS OVERVIEW WILL BE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS, SO MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW!!\n\n*(no financial advice in any way)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 1 (25th April):**\n\nFirst wave of comments and suggestions came in over night. Fixing some typos, updating numbers and adding brokers:\n\nThanks u/InferiorMonkeyRobot, u/MAD_broker, u/AdministrativeTurn84 for an update on Avanza GME-Investors, checking in with [22,202](https://imgur.com/LVanuPA) (+500 since last post).\n\nThanks u/binge360 for pointing out missing broker Hargreaves Landsdown. Added to the list.\n\nThanks, u/Icy_Rhubarb2857 for sharing most traded stocks from [RBC statement for month of March](https://inspiredinvestor.rbcdirectinvesting.com/en/di/hubs/investing-academy/article/top-10-traded-stocks-in-march/kkr40d4p?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newsletter51).\n\nThanks, u/Chabkraken for pointing out missing broker Selfwealth and sending through a screenshot about GME being traded as #1 stock.\n\n**TA;DR** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\nThere  is no way that retail holds less than 100% of the remaining float, the  actuals number might be much (!!!) higher, maybe even in the 1000%+.
