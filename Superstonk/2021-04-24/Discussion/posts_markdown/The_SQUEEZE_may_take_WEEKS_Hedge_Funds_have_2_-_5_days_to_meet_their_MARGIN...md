Hedgies can take up 5 days to meet their margin call, if they can't and their assets are liquidated then we can expect the price to jump and other hedgies receive margin calls which could take UP TO another 5 days.

My SPECULATORY hypothesis of a WORST CASE SCENARIO: 
It's possible that shitadel and friends would use this 5 day gap to fake the squeeze. Imagine this:
Hedgie A gets margin called -> assets liquidated 5 days later and gme jumps XXX% -> other hedgies get margin called and price is currently in the 1000s -> shitadel n friends short the living shit with everything they've got in hopes of dropping the price to sub 100 -> five days later, GME drops enough to be within the threshold for shitadel n friends to not have their assets liquidated -> repeat until only diamond handed apes are left -> price goes to the tens of thousands but ceiling is limited.

HOWEVER, if we BUY & HODL the price would never drop below the margin call threshold. Which will shoot the price to Andromeda. 


OUR JOB IS SIMPLE! BUY AND HODL!!
