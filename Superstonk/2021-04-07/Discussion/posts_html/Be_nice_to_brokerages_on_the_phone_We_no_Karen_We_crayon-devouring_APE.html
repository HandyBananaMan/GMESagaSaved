<p>Basically the title. I know lots of us are reaching out about limit sell orders and finding that we’re kind of getting backhanded by shitadel getting to set rules on both ends. Jokes on them I don’t even know how to sell a stock, and I’ve disabled my sell button on the off chance I figure it out. When you talk with people from fidelity, TD, schwab, etc. be kind and polite. When they put you on hold do a little happy dance because you’re good at that holding shit. Show them that we are the good. We want the best for people. We care. And we will be loyal to them if they take care of us. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
