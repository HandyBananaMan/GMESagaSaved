Apparently there are no sellers...\"\n\nSource: [https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-gme/](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-gme/)\n\nWhat does it mean when there's a wide bid-ask spread? It means the difference between the price you can buy a stock from the price which you can sell it. In my view, this is one marker of volatility, which is why IV rose today. When these spreads widen, the stock can also experience sudden changes in price action.\n\n**So at a certain point in time today, the highest price someone was willing to pay was $173. The lowest someone was willing to sell was $55,999. That's incredible.** \n\n&#x200B;",
