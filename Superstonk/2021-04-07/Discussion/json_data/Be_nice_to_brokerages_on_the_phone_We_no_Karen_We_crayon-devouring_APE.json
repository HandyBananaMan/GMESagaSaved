    "selftext": "Basically the title. I know lots of us are reaching out about limit sell orders and finding that we\u2019re kind of getting backhanded by shitadel getting to set rules on both ends. Jokes on them I don\u2019t even know how to sell a stock, and I\u2019ve disabled my sell button on the off chance I figure it out. When you talk with people from fidelity, TD, schwab, etc. be kind and polite. When they put you on hold do a little happy dance because you\u2019re good at that holding shit. Show them that we are the good. We want the best for people. We care. And we will be loyal to them if they take care of us. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 1: not fking Robinhood.
