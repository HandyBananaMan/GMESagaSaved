I haven't delved into it yet (should really be working), but maybe some apes with more wrinkles than I can take a look at this.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-91491.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ/2021/34-91491.pdf)\n\nEDIT: based on other posts with more clarifying detail, it looks like this one just makes sure that we get paid. I'll go back to lurking and checking on the other rulings now.",
