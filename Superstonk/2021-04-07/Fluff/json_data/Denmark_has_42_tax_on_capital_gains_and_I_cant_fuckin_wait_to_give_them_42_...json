    "selftext": "Here in Denmark we have universal healthcare, students dont pay for any kind of school. University, trade school and so on is completely free. Students over 18 even get 900usd a month from the government, so they dont have to work as much and can focus on their studies. We have 9 months paid maternity leave and you can apply for more if you have complications. We have 6 weeks of paid vacation and paid sickdays, even for the 15 year olds working in your local supermarket. And the minimum wage is about 18$. How? Unions :)\n\nThis is the fucking way guys, and I fuckin cant wait to pay my tribute to this absolutely wonderfull system we have here. \n\nWe even have fixer rooms where small amounts of dope is legal to carry in a vicinity around it. These rooms have needles and what ever you need to shoot up, plus trained health professionals to assist in case of OD. \n\nThese fixer rooms had 10.000 OD cases world wide. How many kicked the bucket? 0\n\nDont fuckin step on your addicts and throw them in jail. Give them the help they need and they will become productive members of society again.\n\nThis is the way guys. We must take care of the poor, the sick, the old and the young! \n\nWith this new wealth it is everyones obligation to spread the prosperity and change their respective country for the better. The money we all are about to get is not just fun money, it is serious money. We will have power and we have to use this power to change things for the better. Tax the rich slimey capitalists and ensure those who are down gets a helping hand!\n\nI could go on and on, but I will leave you with this question.\n\nWhat world do you want your kids to grow up in?\n\nEdit 1: \nSome of you seem to take this as an open invitation to discuss taxation and politics. This was not my intention. I wanted to remind you all to pay your taxes and show love for your neighbors. Especially if your government does not do so.\n\nI will gladly discuss politics with you, but please PM me instead :)",
