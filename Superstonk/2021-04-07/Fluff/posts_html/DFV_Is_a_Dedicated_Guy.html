<p>I cannot imagine the number of violent and legal threats DFV has received throughout this process. He has been openly mocked, threatened, and even aggressively challenged by an active senator. His intelligence and conviction are impressive. To be clear, I am not in GME because of him. I just like the stock. But I am impressed by his level of resolve. After this is all over I genuinely hope that he has the happiest life somewhere. He has helped bring attention to the mass inequality that exists across socioeconomic lines, and m ore impressively, he has done so by merely having conviction about a singly security in which he believes. The same goes for Rensol, Pixel, Redchessqueen, Wardenelite, and the countless others that have stuck their necks out for the causes in which they believe. To be clear, those causes include the opportunity to trade fairly in a truly free and equitable market. That will help reduce national and even global inequality directly.</p>
