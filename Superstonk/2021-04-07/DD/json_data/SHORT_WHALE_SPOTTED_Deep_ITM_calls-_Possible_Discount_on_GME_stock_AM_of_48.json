Another opportunity may present itself tomorrow for apes to do what apes do best- **BUY AND HODL!!!**  To be perfectly clear- **DO NOT DAY TRADE GME**\\- this is just info for those of us who want to BUY MORE TASTY DIPS.  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udd8d\n\nI've been obsessed with options for some time now, since it seems like that's the source of Shitadel's fuckery ammo.  Specifically, they have a habit of setting up DEEP IN-THE-MONEY CALLS right before market close when they're planning a short attack.  [HOW they pull this off is beautifully explained here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mk3gcd/call_memaybe_why_the_massive_volume_of_deep_itm/) thank you u/glide_si and I will definitely be calling. [u/Dan\\_Bren](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dan_Bren/) has made a [very detailed post tracking this options activity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mmjy19/some_deep_itm_calls_were_bought_today_the_final/) The depths of fuckery [are explained in the Frenemies post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mlf82b/the_missing_citadels_frenemies_pfof_michael/) courtesy of u/pinkcatsonacid .  DIVE DEEP into [how the 4/1 options were used](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi31m6/deep_itm_calls_activity_pt2_april_1st_708000_ftds/) courtesy of [u/dejf2](https://www.reddit.com/user/dejf2/) , and [What the DTCC is doing to stop this activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mibedc/the_moass_wont_happen_until_options_are_not/), wrinkles by [u/lighthouse30130](https://www.reddit.com/user/lighthouse30130/) .  For those of you wondering how hedge monkeys are still able to do this with DTC-2021-005 now active, the answer was revealed in Dan\\_bren's post by u/Precocious_Kid :\n\n[Bask in the glory of these brain wrinkles](https://preview.redd.it/d5agdmws00s61.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=845f30d3407dd1390b0df871de0861777514a2cc)\n\nBack to our story!! After days of not seeing any deep ITM calls, a few showed up right at market close today.  [Warden noticed them in his daily post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mm21by/live_charting_for_472021_predicting_the_days/)  The last time I wrote this [strange pattern of options,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhgks7/whale_watching_unusual_options/) hedge monkeys very predictably short-attacked the stock in the first hour of trading the next day.  Here's screenies of this very predictable pattern:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[optionsonar.com](https://preview.redd.it/bnvq2zsqgvr61.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ef0dc20d48db4fc75936efe2bdc51637596941)\n\nWhat happened the next day, 3/18?  Glad you asked.\n\n[From Webull desktop app](https://preview.redd.it/mmhgc737jvr61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8e86434b38a8629f3f1db3228a24eba39b360e)\n\nLet's move forward two weeks to March 31st.  Deep ITM calls set up right before market close:\n\n[ OptionSonar.com](https://preview.redd.it/xbkdl4xojvr61.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa459efac8c253d4800762bdf2229126ce50d23)\n\nAnd can you guess what happened the next morning on 4/1?\n\n[From Webull](https://preview.redd.it/g067nlyblvr61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd4bf3eb09141bd7c51bfa2b9195ffb0365abaa0)\n\nHad to change my pants after that one.  So wasn't I suprised when that evening, a whole crap-ton of deep ITM ~~puts~~ CALLS went up again!!  (Edit: brain very smooth.)\n\n[optionsonar.com](https://preview.redd.it/ll6bip0pnvr61.png?width=1668&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea2df2f3196dcd36494f2e47eb5e54bea7b8027)\n\nSo let's see.... after a long weekend to prep, are they going to tickle us ever-so-sweetly with bullish signals before ramming it down our throats again??\n\n[Webull desktop, heavy action 4\\/1](https://preview.redd.it/my6nmfdvnvr61.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6be7ed7cf2c443081594b9a7d69cb1a46fe40336)\n\nI guess they figured they weren't fooling anyone any more.  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udda7  It's okay, apes like the abuse (I'm dead inside, don't know about you all).  A few days passed without any deep ITM calls, and then BOOM!  Just as the market closed today:\n\n[optionsonar.com](https://preview.redd.it/frqpyb91pvr61.png?width=1663&format=png&auto=webp&s=658730e012cb11fe700fc1ba200963731e535d2b)\n\n*I WONDER WHAT THEY COULD BE UP TO.*  /s  A wise ape once said: \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.\"   Right before they jammed some more crayons into the ear holes *...just to check one more time.*\n\n# TLDR: Options pattern predicts that Shitadel may be putting GME on sale for us to buy tomorrow (4/8) morning.  Enjoy your tasty dip.  BUY AND HODL.\n\nObligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE** unless it's buying more crayons, definitely buy more crayons.\n\nEdit: don't panic if [optionsonar.com](https://optionsonar.com) goes down 4/8.  I thought I saw it get a ~~DDoS~~ RHOD (reddit hug of death, \u2764  u/autoselect37 )  attack today- Warden noticed the same.  lol stoopid hedge monkes \ud83d\udc12\n\nEDIT, UPDATE:  Let's see how this played out in today's price action!\n\n[Morning of 4\\/8, Webull](https://preview.redd.it/x4xlumb3hzr61.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=995407dbf13ab9aa3bad8885e84a0301637ecc70)\n\nWe had some EXCELLENT NEWS TODAY, [Ryan Cohen was named future director of the board!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmpgm2/tears_of_joy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  The news caused a huge spike in price and things were looking excellent for market open!!  *Hedge monkeys can't have that!!!*  Looks like they used the ammo from their deep ITM calls to drop the price at the opening bell and kill the momentum gained from this morning's news.  (The volume and the RSI tells us that shorts made this price move by selling, not just by moving options around.)  Why is this good??  1) Apes can buy more shares now, 2) Shitadel is digging the hole deeper, and 3) by keeping volatility down, they keep IV down and make it cheaper for long whales to buy options to wage war with.  (Apes pls buy shares.)\n\nUPDATE 2: Looks like they had more ammo in the bag for a mid-afternoon short attack!!  (It's very common for them to short attack mid-afternoon, before power hour.)  I, for one, was very happy to do my part to HODL THE LINE-\n\n[Dream come true](https://preview.redd.it/tkn7je0wszr61.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=21fe4c1ff24efbe91f3496d16d662d5016e35fa3)\n\nLine still needs holding- apes!  Stock is still on sale!  Long whales usually wake up from their naps for power hour, so the sale might end then- I don't know this for sure, but they've been pretty predictable in the past.\n\nLast Update!  Bull whales wakin' up and boy they are HONGRY.  Hope my ape family enjoyed the sale today!! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udda7\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udf0c\ud83c\udf0c",
