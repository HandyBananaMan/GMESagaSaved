<p>~~Read the listing carefully and, hopefully, agree with me that DFV as GameStop's Senior Community Manager would have everyone JACKED TO THE FUCKING TITS!~~</p>
<p>Edit: I thought it over and I was waaay over excited. Sorry for stirring the pot at all!</p>
<p>I like the stock. Also, still cool in general that GameStop is looking to hire someone to establish a stronger online presence.</p>
