Salutations my sweet apes, welcome to a special edition price action post with your host, u/possibly6 üöÄ ü¶ç

As always, this aint no mothafuckin financial advice, hoe. The views expressed here are solely my approach to investing in this specific equity. I ape an am.

obligatory.

Sorry for not posting yesterday, combination of jet lag and boring ass price action. I was considering writing a post before open today, but I didn't have the energy, for that I apologize.

Yesterday GME had it's lowest volume in a long time, I stumbled upon this image when I was surfing the sub last night around 1am.

If anyone can tag the creator of this, I will happily give credit. edit: credit to u/cuttingwater_ .

The data here ties into my technical analysis in that volume is super low in consolidation periods. What's very interesting here is if you compare the bolded dates. Compare shares available to borrow, day of the week, low volume, and even how the lowest volume always occurred on a tuesday.

This led me to believe that there was a possibility to see some explosive upwards price action today, but I **expected** nothing, so when nothing happens, I simply go "meh."

Anyways, as of now it is 2:14 PDT, daily volume up until now is **ONLY 4.7 MILLION!**  Before today, the lowest volume GME has seen November 18, where we saw 3.1 million volume.

What's important to look at is the divergence in volume, followed by the sudden explosive buying pressure. This is visualized by the sudden spikes in volume. Notice how every time throughout GME's price action, volume subsides for a bit as the price consolidates, then out of nowhere there is a ridiculous spike in volume.

You can check historical volume here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

So why didn't we see explosive price action today? There are a few theories in place, and I'll you to decide which you agree with simply by browsing the sub and reading the theories. I agree with the theory that the DTCC is essentially buying time to cover their asses, as seen by all the recent filings.

Let's compare the divergence of volume for each of GME's recent price hikes.

[December-January](https://preview.redd.it/jwss8j35ktr61.png?width=2872&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e918dd0732cad9b5f1639349982dc352142953)

Notice how we had a volume spike on 12/22 and 12/23, followed by very little price movement and volume. 1/13 GME ran like crazy, almost up 100% intraday at one point (boy that was a euphoric day for any GME OGs).

&#x200B;

Something to note, 1/13 was a Wednesday.

After the push to 40, notice how volume diverged again (downward slope), then spiked like a motherfucker a few days later.

Now let's look at February, after the massive coordinated dump. Pay close attention to the divergence in volume.

[February view](https://preview.redd.it/k8vla1zxktr61.png?width=1972&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e7c7511e95190a44fb4d091603c66c2f0568a75)

All I want you to takeaway from these images is that our biggest spikes in price come after the lowest subsequent trading volume the day before. 2/23 we had 7.5m volume. 2/24 price ran from 40 to 200 after hours with an astounding 83m volume.

Now let's look at where we are now.

&#x200B;

[Current View](https://preview.redd.it/sfrbp4g8ltr61.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=335f24a7cdd186adf6d06d928387bc9411adb86f)

Notice how we've had very low volume the past week, and today's volume was indeed **LOWER** than yesterday's. hmmmmm.

as far as intraday price action, the pink box (daily chart gap support) ended up holding pretty well during trading today. There were a few instances where price dipped below, only to recover back up above the gap.

If we somehow see even lower volume tomorrow, buckle your seatbelts and put your space suit on.

To be clear, I'm in no way saying the big squeeze starts tomorrow or whenever we see extremely low volume, though it is without a doubt the calm before the storm. I've been adding to my shares position every day, and will continue to every day until the squeeze is squoze.

I know indicators don't really mean jack shit when it comes to manipulated securities, but we are indeed still squeezing on the 4hr chart. I use the squeeze indicator on the 4hr chart pretty often to predict big moves in my trading, the fact that we have been consolidating for a week tells me a big move is coming. Consolidation is denoted by red dots remember.

[4hr view of GME](https://preview.redd.it/jv4wxwc2mtr61.png?width=2862&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d20c8d5506e6967b1aa46815aa2f5adbec119ee)

Notice how the red dots almost always are accurate in predicting the move before it happens. This is the longest consolidation period I have ever seen on GME's 4hr chart. Somethins a brewin.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Volume diverges before meteoric moves. Today volume was even lower than yesterday, and has been diverging the whole week. Seatbelts on apes üöÄ If you day trade gme ur moms a hoe, DO NOT try to sell and buy at a lower price because someone said it might dip. buy MORE on that dip. The pattern of volume is valid as seen through the chart, but we are riding the waves of whales. FTD cycle implies we should see movement, but idgaf anymore. I just hodl and so should you. prepare for the best and expect the worst ;)
