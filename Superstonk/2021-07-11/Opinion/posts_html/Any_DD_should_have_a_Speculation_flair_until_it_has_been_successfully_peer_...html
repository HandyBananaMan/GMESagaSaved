<p>I have posted a few analysis in the past, and quite a few of them were wrong. I used the flair DD because there isn't much definitive difference between "Possible DD" and "DD". Also, I think the flair "DD" causes apes to assume it is immediately THE TRUTH. To prevent false information from entering into superstonk, any submitted DD should have a "Speculation" flair until peer reviewed for accuracy. The "Possible DD" and "DD" flair should be removed and only mods should have the power to grant it.</p>
