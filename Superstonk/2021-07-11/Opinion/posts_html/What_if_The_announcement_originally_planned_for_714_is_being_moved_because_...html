<h1>Title: What if: The announcement originally planned for 7/14 is being moved because the SEC wants to see what happens to the 40M deep OTM shares on Friday 7/16 to potentially take action?</h1>

<p>I'm a non-professional on a computer smashing keys with no financial/professional advice in sight. Apologies if this was covered elsewhere.</p>
<p>Fact: Gamestop is cooperating with the SEC</p>
<p>Fact: There are 40M shares of deep out of the money puts that expire July 16th</p>
<p>Fact: While it's "open to interpretation" any reasonable read would say those deep OTM puts are against the rules to cover shorts.</p>
<p>Fact: They reissued the rules insisting the fact above was always the rule.</p>
<p>Fact: I feel like Dwight talking about beets.</p>
<p>Fact: They have been tightening the rules up regarding shorting.</p>
<p>Leap: Perhaps the SEC wants to see what happens on Friday.  If the shorties find a way out of the inevitable outcome it's another hole that needs patching or is finally the intervention trip wire where the SEC does something. Maybe the SEC is making a case for an arrest and seizure of assets to make sure they have control and feel this is the last item they need.</p>
<p>Gamestop doesn't trigger the MOASS 7/14 because it's triggered 7/16 and/or the SEC gets the information they need and potential control they need to soften the blow to the whole system. If it doesn't happen 7/16, Gamestop can do it soon thereafter.</p>
<p>Tick Tock.</p>
<p>If I did in fact get it right and the SEC/Gamestop wanted to keep this quiet; apologies to the parties that are trying to fix things.</p>
<p>Edit adds:</p>
<p>- I should have said "if there was an announcement planned" in the title; this is all a "what if" scenario so was a little sloppy there.</p>
<p>- The SEC  potentially in coordination with other agencies </p>
