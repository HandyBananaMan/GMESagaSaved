    "selftext": "So, recently news spread, that Melvin Capital made a Q1 loss of around 46%.  I just quickly checked the closing price of GME at the end of March, which was around 194 dollars. \n\nAs a base of my assumption, I assume that major unrealized losses of Melvin Captial result in losses of the illegal short selling of GME. If around 46% losses are realized with a GME closing price of around 194 dollars, then an increase of 1% of losses would equal a GME price increase of around 4.21 dollars. \n\nIf we continue this, we would reach a 100% loss and thus a fully liquidation of Melvin Captial at a GME price of  421 dollars. \n\nNow, my assumption is pretty broad since not all losses are probably due to the illegal GME shorting, but it is fair to say that Melvin Captial is majorly fucked when GME reaches a price of above 350 dollars. \n\nWeird, that the GME price takes hard dumps every time it reaches this threshold.\nTits are jacked.",
