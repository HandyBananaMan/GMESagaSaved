Apologies if this was covered elsewhere.\n\nFact: Gamestop is cooperating with the SEC\n\nFact: There are 40M shares of deep out of the money puts that expire July 16th\n\nFact: While it's \"open to interpretation\" any reasonable read would say those deep OTM puts are against the rules to cover shorts.\n\nFact: They reissued the rules insisting the fact above was always the rule.\n\nFact: I feel like Dwight talking about beets.\n\nFact: They have been tightening the rules up regarding shorting.\n\nLeap: Perhaps the SEC wants to see what happens on Friday.  If the shorties find a way out of the inevitable outcome it's another hole that needs patching or is finally the intervention trip wire where the SEC does something. Maybe the SEC is making a case for an arrest and seizure of assets to make sure they have control and feel this is the last item they need.\n\nGamestop doesn't trigger the MOASS 7/14 because it's triggered 7/16 and/or the SEC gets the information they need and potential control they need to soften the blow to the whole system. If it doesn't happen 7/16, Gamestop can do it soon thereafter.\n\nTick Tock.\n\nIf I did in fact get it right and the SEC/Gamestop wanted to keep this quiet; apologies to the parties that are trying to fix things.\n\nEdit adds:\n\n\\- I should have said \"if there was an announcement planned\" in the title; this is all a \"what if\" scenario so was a little sloppy there.\n\n\\- The SEC  potentially in coordination with other agencies ",
