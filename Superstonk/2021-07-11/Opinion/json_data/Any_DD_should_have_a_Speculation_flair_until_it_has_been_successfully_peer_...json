    "selftext": "I have posted a few analysis in the past, and quite a few of them were wrong. I used the flair DD because there isn't much definitive difference between \"Possible DD\" and \"DD\". Also, I think the flair \"DD\" causes apes to assume it is immediately THE TRUTH. To prevent false information from entering into superstonk, any submitted DD should have a \"Speculation\" flair until peer reviewed for accuracy. The \"Possible DD\" and \"DD\" flair should be removed and only mods should have the power to grant it.",
