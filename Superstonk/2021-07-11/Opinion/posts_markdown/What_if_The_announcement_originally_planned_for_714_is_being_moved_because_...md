# Title: What if: The announcement originally planned for 7/14 is being moved because the SEC wants to see what happens to the 40M deep OTM shares on Friday 7/16 to potentially take action?

I'm a non-professional on a computer smashing keys with no financial/professional advice in sight. Apologies if this was covered elsewhere.

Fact: Gamestop is cooperating with the SEC

Fact: There are 40M shares of deep out of the money puts that expire July 16th

Fact: While it's "open to interpretation" any reasonable read would say those deep OTM puts are against the rules to cover shorts.

Fact: They reissued the rules insisting the fact above was always the rule.

Fact: I feel like Dwight talking about beets.

Fact: They have been tightening the rules up regarding shorting.

Leap: Perhaps the SEC wants to see what happens on Friday.  If the shorties find a way out of the inevitable outcome it's another hole that needs patching or is finally the intervention trip wire where the SEC does something. Maybe the SEC is making a case for an arrest and seizure of assets to make sure they have control and feel this is the last item they need.

Gamestop doesn't trigger the MOASS 7/14 because it's triggered 7/16 and/or the SEC gets the information they need and potential control they need to soften the blow to the whole system. If it doesn't happen 7/16, Gamestop can do it soon thereafter.

Tick Tock.

If I did in fact get it right and the SEC/Gamestop wanted to keep this quiet; apologies to the parties that are trying to fix things.

Edit adds:

\- I should have said "if there was an announcement planned" in the title; this is all a "what if" scenario so was a little sloppy there.

\- The SEC  potentially in coordination with other agencies
