    "selftext": "Just a quick quote off of Wikipedia:\n\n> In 2005, Burry started to focus on the subprime market. Through his analysis of mortgage lending practices in 2003 and 2004, he correctly predicted that the real estate bubble would collapse as early as 2007. \n\nJust remember this when everyone is throwing around dates. Maybe rewatch the movie the big short. That scene where he is angrily waiting and everyone is losing hope? Those 2 minutes are worth 2 years in real life.\n\nHOLD. They want you to break down and sell.\n\nFocus on other things in your life. I am currently starting to learn playing piano at mid 30s of age. Great past time and very rewarding. The MOASS will happen in time... and I will be playing Major Tom on the piano when it happens.",
