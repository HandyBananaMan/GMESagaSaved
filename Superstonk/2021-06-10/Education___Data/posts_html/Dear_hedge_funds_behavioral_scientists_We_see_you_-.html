<p>So you read the second chapter of some standard social psychology textbook, and learned that an anti-climax is a bummer and demotivates people to invest in long-term goals. You put 2 and 2 together, and run all the way to your boss to propose a clever plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Steadily let apes raise their expectations, all the way up to an "important" date (6/9).</li>
<li>On this date, after closing, bring them down, and push harder on the next day.</li>
<li>rEseArcH shOws thAt anTI-climAtic ouTcOmes crUsH mOtivatiOn.</li>
<li>See how apes slowly post Hercules' "Disappointed" gifs, point fingers at each other, mishandle their frustration, and retreat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not bad! "Oh, but it's all about creating momentum, creating some critical mass... apes follow others like ants!"</p>
<p>This is where you got it all wrong (plus, apes are a different species than ants*). Our strategy is dominant: we all individually see that holding makes sense. A drop is a dip. And we can wait! Now that you think about it... we do enjoy the wait! This sub has become such a fun daily hangout for us. Have you seen the comments during weekends? We hate the weekends (except for the weekends in which we see pictures of office buildings with the lights on).</p>
<p>We like the process and we like the potential outcome [read this sentence again, in case you managed to get to the chapter about intrinsic motivation].</p>
<p>I feel you, nevertheless. If I were hired to design a social scientific strategy to demotivate apes, I'd be scratching my head with a lot of stress. Ask Economics Nobel laureates how to make agents deviate from dominant strategies. It's hard! Specially when agents are long-term oriented. By now, the average ape has trained eyes to spot shills and FUD at first sight, and we are proud to count on the Knights of New, and Satori. You have a tough task ahead.</p>
<p>Sure, we like green candles. But trust me: you are dealing with a strange species here. Your "science" has not power in here.</p>
<p>Stay hydrated,</p>
<p>An average ape.</p>
<p>Edit: *Apes are different than <em>regular</em> ants. Now, Korean Ants... those are on entire league of their own, and apes cannot be prouder to join forces with them.</p>
