IDK what I am doin here but I like green crayons so I talk with friends about them.*\n\n*\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80*\n\nWe are at 22.77mil volume at the time I am writing this. It has been a brutal day - for sure... BUT did it feel like a \\~23mil volume day to you?! Not for me.   \nMidday I felt like: Ye another slow bleeding day on volume for ants. Then I checked the volume and saw that we already passed the 10 mil range and had many hours to the closing bell.\n\nAnd then I asked myself: Was it the same way after last earnings? Cause I definitely did not remember such a slow bleed over the day on such \"high volume\" and many ppl mentioned that the prices behaved quite the same on the last earnings.\n\n# Lets get started with the brainfarting \ud83d\udca9:\n\nOn March 23th (last time Gamestop released earnings) the volume was 12,5mil. Nothing special cause the earnings got reported after hours like usual. We had a good volume on AH trading followed by a crunchy 22,9mil volume day on March 24th (sounds familiar? Not yet cause I didn't tell you todays numbers - lol gotcha). \n\nHere the chart for March 23th and March 24th (30min candles):\n\n[March 23\\/24th](https://preview.redd.it/xy2hfvn2qi471.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=3af8d72974f77f6c53545c207350cbcee9c8c311)\n\nMarch 24th intraday looks kinda familiar right? Painful slowbleed.\n\n**22,9mil volume on March 24th** seems also quite familiar and high compared to the previous day **volume on 23th March** with **12,5mil.**\n\nRegarding prices:\n\n**March 23th price** @ 5pm EST: \\~184,48$\n\n**March 24th closing price** @ 4pm EST: \\~123,88$\n\nDecline from earnings to following day: 184,48$ - 123,88 = 60,6$ (equals a **\\~32,85%** decline)\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLets take a look at yesterdays and todays chart:\n\n[June 9\\/10th](https://preview.redd.it/3kgeheaqri471.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=876a2279075362ac5b9f223cdb8803c73a7be2ad)\n\nOh ye I remember: Painful Slowbleed (not so painful anymore since we are all dead inside).\n\nOn **June 9th** we had a daily **volume** of **\\~12,6mil**.\n\nOn **June 10th** we had a **volume** of **\\~22,7mil**. (Hmmmmmmmmm...)\n\nNow regarding the price action:\n\n**June 9th price** @ 5pm EST: \\~304,19$\n\n**June 10th** closing price @ 4pm EST: \\~220,39$\n\nDecline from earning to following day: 304,19$ - 220,39$ = 83,8$ (equals a **\\~27,55%** decline)\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nNot jumping to conclusions here cause we learned in the past that the past will stay the past.   \nBut still: I am pretty jacked about after hours action right now and the coming intraday action tomorrow!! If premarket dips aswell after a big rip, the price action will be nearly the same and I will expect some crazy action! Aligning with Elliot wave boy and exponential floor dude I am prettttty sureeeee it will be a wild ride apes and apettes!\n\n**TLDR:**   \n\\- Volume and price action on both earning days are quite similiar:\n\n* *Volume March 23th: \\~****12,5mil****; Volume March 24th: \\~****22,9mil****.* \n* *Volume June 9th: \\~****12,6mil****; Volume June 10th: \\~****22,7mil***\n\n\\- Price decline between earnings and next day closing price are also \"quite\" the same:\n\n* \\-**32,85%** in March \n* **-27,55%** in June. \n\n\\- Charts looking nearly the same. \n\nJACKED FOR TOMORROW!!! Get in the rocket cause it seems like we are goin pouuuuuuffff \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80!!!\n\n**Easteregg Titties Jacking:** March 25th we raised from \\~122$ to \\~182$ what equals a **49,18% jump**. If history repeats itself we could go from 220,39$ to 220,39$ + 49,18% = **328,78$ EOD.**",
