    "selftext": "Today\u2019s price movement seems unnatural right? The volume is also unnaturally high for this time of day and with this type of downward movement. \n\nWhy is this happening?!? (You might ask!)\n\nIt has to be Kenny and Co creating more synthetic shares! (you exclaim) \n\nWhile this could be a possibility there is another much more likely reason. \n\nI think back to April when GameStop was doing their first offering of 3.5 million shares. While this was happening, there was just a downward force that felt like it couldn\u2019t be stopped. We all hypothesized that Kenny and Co were up to their normal fuckery only to find out a week or two later that GameStop had completed its offering over the course of that dip. \n\n\nTHE SAME THING IS LIKELY HAPPENING NOW. \n\nGameStop announced yesterday that they could potentially be issuing 5 million more shares to raise capital and strengthen the balance sheet. \n\nOn the 8-k there was another caveat that many apes PROBABLY have missed. This being the MAXIMUM offering price of $255.50.\n\nNow, I\u2019m too smooth brained to tell you what goes into coming up with this maximum offering price, BUT what I can tell you is that it is on there and you can look for yourself. \n\n\nMy theory: \n\nGameStop is currently doing their offering which is bringing the price down to $255~ range so they can sell their shares and collect the capital now before the rocket takes off. If they were to do it later, it could hinder the rocket much harder. So the sooner they tear the bandaid off the better. \n\n- I ALSO believe GameStop and papa Cohen anticipated a short attack by Kenny and Co after earnings, which would create a downward momentum and create the perfect opportunity to sell their shares at $255 market price to retail and long institutions (unlike the movie stock who sells directly to short hedge funds)\n\nWith this capital they can make hype acquisitions and great business moves that will increase buying pressure as the year progresses. \n\nThis is how we achieve a self fulfilling prophecy (check Tesla 2020 squeeze for reference). \n\nTL;DR: Everyone just needs to sit back, relax, buy the dip, and hodl. Papa Cohen is playing 8d chess and has got us.\n\nEdit: after some apes questioned this maximum share limit, I looked into it more. This limit should be looked as a more of an average of $255. GameStop wants about 1.1-1.2 billion in proceeds from the stock sale. On 5 million shares, that average comes out to about $255. HOWEVER, if they were to make 1.1 billion while only selling 3 million shares then GREAT. BUT, the way the chart is set up right now, $230-270 is like a sweet zone to be able to sell these extra shares to retail apes (keep them out of SHFs hand). If they can get all 5 million shares out today around that sweet zone and come out with an extra billion for acquisitions and business moves, AND SHFs don\u2019t get their hands on more shares, then this is FANTASTIC.\n\nEdit 2: Link to offering details: https://news.gamestop.com/node/18961/html",
