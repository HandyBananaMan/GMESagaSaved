<p><em>I am not a financial advisor. Either way I don't live in Murica so I guess you can't even sue me ? IDK what I am doin here but I like green crayons so I talk with friends about them.</em></p>
<p><em>ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</em></p>
<p>We are at 22.77mil volume at the time I am writing this. It has been a brutal day - for sure... BUT did it feel like a \~23mil volume day to you?! Not for me. <br />
Midday I felt like: Ye another slow bleeding day on volume for ants. Then I checked the volume and saw that we already passed the 10 mil range and had many hours to the closing bell.</p>
<p>And then I asked myself: Was it the same way after last earnings? Cause I definitely did not remember such a slow bleed over the day on such "high volume" and many ppl mentioned that the prices behaved quite the same on the last earnings.</p>
<h1>Lets get started with the brainfarting ðŸ’©:</h1>
<p>On March 23th (last time Gamestop released earnings) the volume was 12,5mil. Nothing special cause the earnings got reported after hours like usual. We had a good volume on AH trading followed by a crunchy 22,9mil volume day on March 24th (sounds familiar? Not yet cause I didn't tell you todays numbers - lol gotcha). </p>
<p>Here the chart for March 23th and March 24th (30min candles):</p>

<p>March 24th intraday looks kinda familiar right? Painful slowbleed.</p>
<p><strong>22,9mil volume on March 24th</strong> seems also quite familiar and high compared to the previous day <strong>volume on 23th March</strong> with <strong>12,5mil.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding prices:</p>
<p><strong>March 23th price</strong> @ 5pm EST: \~184,48$</p>
<p><strong>March 24th closing price</strong> @ 4pm EST: \~123,88$</p>
<p>Decline from earnings to following day: 184,48$ - 123,88 = 60,6$ (equals a <strong>\~32,85%</strong> decline)</p>
<p>ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>Lets take a look at yesterdays and todays chart:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/3kgeheaqri471.png?width=1348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=876a2279075362ac5b9f223cdb8803c73a7be2ad">June 9\/10th</a></p>
<p>Oh ye I remember: Painful Slowbleed (not so painful anymore since we are all dead inside).</p>
<p>On <strong>June 9th</strong> we had a daily <strong>volume</strong> of <strong>\~12,6mil</strong>.</p>
<p>On <strong>June 10th</strong> we had a <strong>volume</strong> of <strong>\~22,7mil</strong>. (Hmmmmmmmmm...)</p>
<p>Now regarding the price action:</p>
<p><strong>June 9th price</strong> @ 5pm EST: \~304,19$</p>
<p><strong>June 10th</strong> closing price @ 4pm EST: \~220,39$</p>
<p>Decline from earning to following day: 304,19$ - 220,39$ = 83,8$ (equals a <strong>\~27,55%</strong> decline)</p>
<p>ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
<p>Not jumping to conclusions here cause we learned in the past that the past will stay the past. <br />
But still: I am pretty jacked about after hours action right now and the coming intraday action tomorrow!! If premarket dips aswell after a big rip, the price action will be nearly the same and I will expect some crazy action! Aligning with Elliot wave boy and exponential floor dude I am prettttty sureeeee it will be a wild ride apes and apettes!</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> <br />
- Volume and price action on both earning days are quite similiar:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Volume March 23th: \~</em><strong><em>12,5mil</em></strong><em>; Volume March 24th: \~</em><strong><em>22,9mil</em></strong><em>.</em> </li>
<li><em>Volume June 9th: \~</em><strong><em>12,6mil</em></strong><em>; Volume June 10th: \~</em><strong><em>22,7mil</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>- Price decline between earnings and next day closing price are also "quite" the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>-<strong>32,85%</strong> in March </li>
<li><strong>-27,55%</strong> in June. </li>
</ul>
<p>- Charts looking nearly the same. </p>
<p>JACKED FOR TOMORROW!!! Get in the rocket cause it seems like we are goin pouuuuuuffff ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!!!</p>
<p><strong>Easteregg Titties Jacking:</strong> March 25th we raised from \~122$ to \~182$ what equals a <strong>49,18% jump</strong>. If history repeats itself we could go from 220,39$ to 220,39$ + 49,18% = <strong>328,78$ EOD.</strong></p>
