# Disclosure of a financial system which hides naked shorts by deleting shareholder votes.

[Part 2: Over-Voting Prevention Exposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o81w2t/overvoting_prevention_exposed_part_2/)

# TLDR

**Broadridge** **detects over-reporting and provides early warning to the DTCC, DTCC is the black box which obfuscates operational naked shorts, Computershare does final touch-ups on shareholder votes to ensure no more than 100% of issued shares are voted.**

**Broadridge points the finger at tabulators. Tabulators point the finger at SEC and Broadridge.**

# TADR

**They spent the last 20 years developing a system to hide naked shorts by rigging the shareholder voting system.**

# Preface

On Jun 9, 2021 GME revealed [55,541,279 votes were tabulated for their 8-K Filing](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-gamestop-corp-1326380-8k-2021-june-09-18787-709). The results are as follows:

There are some discrepancies as to whether this report is an accurate reflection of the total votes submitted by shareholders. In this article, we explore how those discrepancies should be further investigated, and we allude to the system which hides naked shorts by refusing to disclose the true sum of shareholder votes.

For our purposes, some financial vocabulary:

* **Over-Reporting:** Votes that would exceed the count are not forwarded to a tabulator.
* **Omnibus Proxy:** Holder of record is self-regulated.
* **Over-Voting:** Votes accepted by tabulators which exceed count are determined to be invalid.
* **Broker Search:** AKA “notice and inquiry,” a SEC-mandated process whereby brokers, banks and other intermediaries are contacted to determine how many annual reports and proxy statements will need to be printed. Usually initiated 70 business days prior to record date.
* **Record Date:** Companies send proxy statements to a list of the shareholders who held the stock on the “annual meeting record date.” This date is usually set 50 days before the annual meeting.

# Chapter 1: Enter GME's Transfer Agent, Computershare

From the [GME Proxy Materials](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18846/html):

>We have engaged Computershare, our transfer agent, as our inspector of elections to receive and tabulate votes. Computershare will separately tabulate “for” and “against” votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. Computershare will also certify the results and determine the existence of a quorum and the validity of proxies and ballots.

https://preview.redd.it/qamsbbitef471.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=a78c907c8b584d864d207f8a50c953c96ab7e49e

Computershare is a global market leader in transfer  agency, employee equity plans, proxy solicitation,  stakeholder communications, and other diversified  financial and governance services. Many of the world’s  leading organizations use Computershare’s services  to help maximize the value of relationships with their  investors, employees, creditors, members and customers

Now, Computershare is interesting because they provide real-time proxy reporting features and minute-by-minute results which allow Ryan Cohen and team to monitor changes in overall voting positions 24/7. Basically, they keep board members one-step ahead of the voting results.

It is critical to note that tabulators do not permit actual over-voting at the meeting: voting is reconciled prior to the meeting to ensure that no more than 100% of issued shares are voted. It sounds shady because it is. But not for the reasons you think. Let's dive in.

In 2019, [Computershare wrote a love letter to the SEC](https://www.computershare.com/News/SEC%20File%20No.%204-725%20US%20Proxy%20Reform%20Submission%20Post%202018%20Roundtable.pdf):

So, given this context, we know that Computershare is well aware that votes aren't counted. In fact, they're involved in the trimming process. But only at the tail end, and they do it for compliance purposes. Remember, this is a vendor selected by GME and trimming the votes is a generally accepted practice since no one can make sense of fuckall shares in the world.

# Chapter 2: Computershare describes the Shareholder Voting Process

Diagrams are borrowed from this [ComputerShare White Paper](https://cdn.ymaws.com/stai.org/resource/resmgr/ta_overview_whitepaper_compu.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/c9t5r7mjff471.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=5933c8b7e8bec78359126a245938027965c42ff4

Notice that Computershare does not collect the votes, they are merely the Transfer Agent and Tabulator. Computershare might also provide some solicitation and fact-gathering services for GME. But the actual security positions and proxy distribution are performed by the DTCC and a company called Broadridge.

Ah, our good friend CEDE & Co, I was wondering when you'd make it to the party. Fashionably late yet arrived just in time to relieve us of our voting authority. Generous of you. Have you had any luck self-regulating today?

https://preview.redd.it/1v9zob14gf471.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa83e34fa75a1a355a719bc90ef4fa165c7ce15a

Evidently, typing "Over Reporting Prevention Service" into the Broadridge search tool turns up 2000+ results. That is a lot of over reporting prevention! All jokes aside, they are the BEST at preventing naked shorts from showing up in those pesky shareholder votes.

I hope to learn more soon, in the meantime can you tell me how it works?

https://preview.redd.it/lwomow82gf471.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=49f9e46978e09edff48711b87ac51ef85bc6647a

So Broadridge is sending Alerts to an intermediary before the votes can reach the tabulator. How often is that intermediary your broker? How often is it the DTCC? What an interesting quandary. Look at all these red flags they hoped you wouldn't see.

# Chapter 3: A brief intermission with The Securities Transfer Association

https://preview.redd.it/zc756z8vff471.png?width=110&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ed711fffced4aa0e54345bc7b46d7143b389a90

The Securities Transfer Association (“STA”) appreciates the opportunity to  submit this letter in anticipation of the SEC’s upcoming Roundtable on the  Proxy Process. Founded in 1911, the STA is the professional association of  transfer agents and represents more than 130 commercial stock transfer agents,  bond agents, mutual fund agents, and related service providers within the  United States and Canada.

So here's a fun time: (Hint, [More Letters to the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-725/4725-4530590-176075.pdf))

https://preview.redd.it/rtcsgagzgf471.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=89c55c927dbca8305326e92ce3f52d1676c8dc45

So, you're telling me that with all the advanced early warning detection systems in place by Broadridge^(®) and the DTCC, hedgies are so fuk that nobody in the financial sector can produce a fully reconciled report to the tabulator? (Remember, 178 million shares is the number that slipped past the DTCC-Broadridge^(®) Fail Safes in this particular sample size.)

https://preview.redd.it/p19lglkdgf471.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead4740bd1bf0075d6926dfc3a5c6e812a2de634

&#x200B;

But don't worry, we've got the DTCC on speed dial, and they say it's all good, except for 134 / 757th's of the time.

# Chapter 4: Let's Tabulate Anyway

And only because we have to.

https://preview.redd.it/xayhdh8rjf471.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d01025db03e22db7968e192b67384bff966bbe

So you, the beneficial owner, return your voting instructions to your broker, but it actually gets routed to Broadridge^(®). You have no confirmation whether your vote will actually be submitted.

Now, I added this hypothetical step here which indicates the Over-Reporting Prevention and Alert System. I could be mistaken and it actually goes to the Brokers and Banks, but that implies more executives are on the take for concealing operational naked shorts. Let's start small and stick with the u/atobitt House of Cards III theory that the DTCC enforcement division is sitting in a dark room  repeatedly pressing their F3-keys.

# POP QUIZ

With the over-reporting alerts on hand, the DTCC attempts to:

* A) reconcile the over-reporting
* B) lookup the record date
* C) give up because it can't be reconciled
* D) delete the votes

So now, the tabulator receives a doctored report, and it's mostly nice! There are shareholders and names and dates and it all pretty much adds up to some really neat corporate governance that's sort of true and even useful!

The Tabulator tallies it all up and checks their list twice. They might report some discrepancies to the board and warn them of strange anomalies, but what are you gonna do? You got a company to run.

# Chapter 5: Okay, now Broadridge

https://preview.redd.it/0v5befyggf471.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb5342d5ad3688fee95627ea16f3a7e13b6672c5

Broadridge Financial Solutions is a public corporate services company founded in 2007 as a spin-off from Automatic Data Processing. The main business of Broadridge is as a service provider supplying public companies with proxy statements, annual reports and other financial documents, and shareholder communications solutions, such as virtual annual meetings.

The neat thing about Broadridge is they're kind of like the Robin Hood of Proxy Voting. With a track record of innovation, they're [really good at collecting those votes!](https://lautorite.qc.ca/fileadmin/lautorite/consultations/commentaires/valeurs-mobilieres/2013-11-13/broadridge.pdf)

https://preview.redd.it/t7qkghgjgf471.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=62348e9e05693dfc5c042ab2453ddda6aecba93a

They're also really good at blaming everyone else:

>Given these facts, we suggest that:  
>  
>  To ensure vote integrity and that equitable principles are applied to vote tabulation, the CSA might consider  requiring entities who perform vote tabulation to make transparent and publicly available their tabulation  processes and related procedures  
>  
> A review of the DTCC participant position report distribution process may help to ensure that the meeting  tabulators are receiving and reconciling all positions for an issuer  
>  
> Meeting tabulators voluntarily disclose their reconciliation method

But the innovation didn't stop in 2013, nope! They just kept on Innovating right into 2014!

This resulted in a very neat and scalable way to prevent those pesky naked shorts from showing up in the over-reporting column!
