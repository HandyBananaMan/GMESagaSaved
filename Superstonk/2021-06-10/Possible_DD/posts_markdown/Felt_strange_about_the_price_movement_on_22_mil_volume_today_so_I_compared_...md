*I am not a financial advisor. Either way I don't live in Murica so I guess you can't even sue me ? IDK what I am doin here but I like green crayons so I talk with friends about them.*

We are at 22.77mil volume at the time I am writing this. It has been a brutal day - for sure... BUT did it feel like a \~23mil volume day to you?! Not for me.   
Midday I felt like: Ye another slow bleeding day on volume for ants. Then I checked the volume and saw that we already passed the 10 mil range and had many hours to the closing bell.

And then I asked myself: Was it the same way after last earnings? Cause I definitely did not remember such a slow bleed over the day on such "high volume" and many ppl mentioned that the prices behaved quite the same on the last earnings.

# Lets get started with the brainfarting ðŸ’©:

On March 23th (last time Gamestop released earnings) the volume was 12,5mil. Nothing special cause the earnings got reported after hours like usual. We had a good volume on AH trading followed by a crunchy 22,9mil volume day on March 24th (sounds familiar? Not yet cause I didn't tell you todays numbers - lol gotcha). 

Here the chart for March 23th and March 24th (30min candles):

[March 23\/24th](https://preview.redd.it/xy2hfvn2qi471.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=3af8d72974f77f6c53545c207350cbcee9c8c311)

March 24th intraday looks kinda familiar right? Painful slowbleed.

**22,9mil volume on March 24th** seems also quite familiar and high compared to the previous day **volume on 23th March** with **12,5mil.**

Regarding prices:

**March 23th price** @ 5pm EST: \~184,48$

**March 24th closing price** @ 4pm EST: \~123,88$

Decline from earnings to following day: 184,48$ - 123,88 = 60,6$ (equals a **\~32,85%** decline)

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Lets take a look at yesterdays and todays chart:

[June 9\/10th](https://preview.redd.it/3kgeheaqri471.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=876a2279075362ac5b9f223cdb8803c73a7be2ad)

Oh ye I remember: Painful Slowbleed (not so painful anymore since we are all dead inside).

On **June 9th** we had a daily **volume** of **\~12,6mil**.

On **June 10th** we had a **volume** of **\~22,7mil**. (Hmmmmmmmmm...)

Now regarding the price action:

**June 9th price** @ 5pm EST: \~304,19$

**June 10th** closing price @ 4pm EST: \~220,39$

Decline from earning to following day: 304,19$ - 220,39$ = 83,8$ (equals a **\~27,55%** decline)

ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Not jumping to conclusions here cause we learned in the past that the past will stay the past.   
But still: I am pretty jacked about after hours action right now and the coming intraday action tomorrow!! If premarket dips aswell after a big rip, the price action will be nearly the same and I will expect some crazy action! Aligning with Elliot wave boy and exponential floor dude I am prettttty sureeeee it will be a wild ride apes and apettes!

**TLDR:**   
\- Volume and price action on both earning days are quite similiar:

* *Volume March 23th: \~****12,5mil****; Volume March 24th: \~****22,9mil****.* 
* *Volume June 9th: \~****12,6mil****; Volume June 10th: \~****22,7mil***

\- Price decline between earnings and next day closing price are also "quite" the same:

* \-**32,85%** in March 
* **-27,55%** in June. 

\- Charts looking nearly the same. 

JACKED FOR TOMORROW!!! Get in the rocket cause it seems like we are goin pouuuuuuffff ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€!!!

**Easteregg Titties Jacking:** March 25th we raised from \~122$ to \~182$ what equals a **49,18% jump**. If history repeats itself we could go from 220,39$ to 220,39$ + 49,18% = **328,78$ EOD.**
