If you would have told me 6 months ago that I would lose thousands of dollars in one day and that it wouldn’t bother me one bit… Like not even a little 😏

I’m sitting here laughing at memes about Elliot Wave Guy… What a time to be alive.

I’ve bought. I’ve voted. I’m hodling. I’m buckled in. 🚀🚀🚀🌙🥂

Edit: I didn’t think it possible, but I feel even better now 😻
