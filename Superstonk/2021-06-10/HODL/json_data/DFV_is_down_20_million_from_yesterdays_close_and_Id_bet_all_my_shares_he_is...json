    "selftext": "As the title says. Keep the chins up apes! I have a very sneaky suspicion GME has sold all their shares today at market value and this explains the continued slow drop in price. Super bullish for tomorrow as we are definitely oversold at this point and due a nice gap fill up. \n\nI couldn't be more bullish on this stock, bring it back to 50 Kenny and watch everyone quadruple down. Its inevitable at this point. I have big hopes for a big announcement at E3 aswell. \n\nBuckle up apes, it's going to be a very bumpy ride, I'll see you all on the moon for sock cocktails.",
