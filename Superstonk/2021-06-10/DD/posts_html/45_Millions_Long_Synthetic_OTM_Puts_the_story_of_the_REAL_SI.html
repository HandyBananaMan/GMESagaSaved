<p>Alright boring day, so perfect timing to write something !</p>
<p><em>Last friday i published a picture of Deep Put Options, without giving an explanation ,; as requested here we go!</em></p>
<p><strong>Buckle UP!!</strong></p>
<p>First pic:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8p7mwyxo2h471.png?width=776&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f9e55243802ed4eb79be34f495bc8255207e206">Total Open Interest Puts at every date</a></p>
<p><em>Here you have the Total Open interested for every dates  available in Deep OTM Puts. As you can see I just stopped counting at 5$ strike and we have already 45M Shares under contract with the biggest day July 16 and Januray 21 on those two days we have 29M shares just at 0,5$ strike!! We have other strike going untill the current price so you can add dozens of millions, but i just wanted for this purpose to focus on the deepest so useless ones.</em></p>
<p><strong>Who wants to buy so much deep OTM puts, for sure the price will never go there, so why losing money in premiums?</strong></p>

<p><em>In this second pic, I wanted to see if it was a common practice, as you can see we dont have those numbers in other stocks even the others “Meme” ones !</em></p>
<p><em>(here I stopped at the 6th strike for each stock)</em></p>
<p><strong>The theory is simple, you are looking at our dear shorts..... How do that? `Receipe:</strong></p>
<p>one <strong>Hedge Fund</strong> + one <strong>Market Maker</strong> <em>( good we know two of them!)</em></p>
<p>one short “covered” by an <strong>ITM Calls</strong> (many post about those ITM Calls bought) + a <strong>long Put OTM</strong></p>
<p>= Et voila!</p>
<p>of course you can add the official SI reported + ETF shorted and with all that you have a better view on the real SI%</p>
<p>As I am not English speaker, I will copy some part of an interesting old article explaining the RECEIPE and talking about those Deep OTM Puts to cover shorts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>From <a href="https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/"><strong>TradeSmithDaily</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The way the hedge funds made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.</strong></p>
<p><em>The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.</em></p>
<p><em>The</em> <strong><em>SEC memo</em></strong> <em>is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can</em> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf"><strong><em>read it here via the SEC website</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>If short sellers are facing a squeeze</em></strong> <em>because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can</em> <strong><em>create an appearance of having closed</em></strong> <em>their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.</em></li>
<li><em>A hedge fund that is short a stock</em> <strong><em>can write call options</em></strong> <em>on a stock — meaning t</em><strong><em>hey are now “short”</em></strong> <em>the call options,</em> <strong><em>having sold the call</em></strong> <em>options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously</em> <strong><em>buy shares against the call options</em></strong>*.*</li>
<li><strong><em>The shares</em></strong> <em>bought against the call options could be</em> <strong><em>“synthetic” longs</em></strong> <em>— meaning they are</em> <strong><em>not part of the original share float</em></strong> <em>of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.</em></li>
<li><em>This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer,</em> <strong><em>the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function.</em></strong> <em>This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.</em></li>
<li><em>As a result of the above transaction,</em> <strong><em>the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls.</em></strong> <em>(A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.</em></li>
<li><em>The hedge fund that bought the shares</em> <strong><em>can now report that they have “bought back” their short</em></strong> <em>position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that <strong>hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes</strong> that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.</p>
<p>Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.</em></strong><strong>”</strong></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>In short (no pun intended) these tricks <strong>“help hedge funds maintain short positions</strong> that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily <strong>high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver</strong> Shares (<a href="https://wherearetheshares.com/">Where are the Shares?</a>) and <strong>Michael Burry’s</strong> (now deleted tweet viewable here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en">Cassandra</a>) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On the Other side those Short ITM Calls  and the Puts written  are never delivered so what happen T+ 21 ( now we know what happens those days ) and what if Not deliver at the proper date? T+35 to go buy on the market the equities....</p>
<p>This explain also why we have those pics on <strong>T+21 and T+35 days.</strong>.... they are just delaying the inevitable  by reseting the clock but between each delivery day they keep shorting... Tic/Tac......</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:  SI% Higher, hidden behind short calls ITM and long Puts OTM.</strong> </p>
