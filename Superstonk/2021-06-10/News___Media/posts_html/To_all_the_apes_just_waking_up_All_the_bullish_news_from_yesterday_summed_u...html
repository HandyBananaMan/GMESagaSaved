<p>To all the Euro apes, Asian apes ADU's (Apes down under, who already have been working a whole morning jacked). Here are some bullish bullet points about all the news that came out yesterday. But beware you could become too jacked. So all this is not financial advice.</p>
<p>All the bullish news;</p>
<p>- GameStop had $1.28B in revenue, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwd8ru/facts_from_692021/">beating the expected earnings</a> of $1.17B by a big margin.</p>
<p>- GameStop had an adjusted loss per share of 45 cents vs. expected loss per share of 71 cents. Beating this too.</p>
<p>- New (ex-Amazon) CEO with a lot of experience to build even more awesome stuff! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw50qe/gamestop_announces_appointments_of_chief/">Welcome Matt Furlong</a></p>
<p>- New (ex-Amazon) CFO, welcome Mike Recupero!</p>
<p>- Ryan Cohen is now officially the chairman of the board!</p>
<p>- Short squeezes get mentioned again in their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw7we7/gamestop_lists_a_short_squeeze_as_the_first_item/">424B5 filing</a>. Yes you read that correct. That is multiple squeezes! Plural, so at least one still to come!</p>
<p>- The most important part, the total count of votes. You were not the only one disappointed, I can tell you that. But our wacko American ape brothers did the math. <strong>THE NUMBER OF VOTES EQUALS THE ENTIRE FLOAT ON APRIL 14. THIS IS UNHEARD OF AND MEANS THE NUMBER IS NORMALIZED BY THE VOTING SERVICE AND IS NOT THE REAL NUMBER OF SHARES.</strong> Thank you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/imahoeforlsd/">u/imahoeforlsd</a>! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw9uq4/the_number_of_votes_equals_the_entire_float_on/">Source.</a></p>
<p>- Why u ask? Well because <strong>YOU CAN NOT REPORT AN OVERVOTE ON AN 8-K. PASS IT ON!</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw8ak8/you_cant_report_an_overvote_on_an_8k_pass_it_on/">Source</a>.</p>
<p>One more thing, did you see the drop in the After Market? Well they shorted every <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw6amn/every_etf_containing_gme_was_just_shorted_this/">ETF with GME</a> in it. Every fucking one. Someone is very very desperate. Someone who likes lots of mayo.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And besides all that bullishness this was stated in the GME 10Q:</p>

<p>The SEC has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw5jh8/sec_apparently_is_investigating_trading_activity/">requested</a> a voluntary production of documents regarding unknown info. What could that be about? Guess what, maybe about voting, a stop the count or to be blunt; a overvote because of lots and lots of naked shares? Who knows? But get your hats on and strap in because loads and loads of DD will be out the coming days and weeks!</p>
<p>- Back to <img alt="Elliot Waves" src="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nw84nw/elliot_waves_and_gme_why_tomorrow_should_be/" />, this ape doesn't understand a word. But also bullish. How much bullishness do we need? I can not be more jacked, can I?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So spread this bullish news. Expect fuckery tomorrow (yes, today I know). And BUY THE FUCKING DIP!</p>
<p>Per our new motto; BUY, HODL and BUCKLE UP!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit 1: some formatting, because on mobile it is shit.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I forgot to mention the possibility to a share offering. GME announced they, from now on, can issue another 5 million shares of their common stock. ONLY THE POSSIBILITY has been announced. Not that they are going to use it on the short term. They state that they will use this option if they need the cash. Guess what? THEY DON'T NEED IT RIGHT NOW, because of the earlier at the market offering they are flush with cash.</p>
<p>Edit 3: you mad fuckers should be all awake by now. Why not buy some more?</p>
