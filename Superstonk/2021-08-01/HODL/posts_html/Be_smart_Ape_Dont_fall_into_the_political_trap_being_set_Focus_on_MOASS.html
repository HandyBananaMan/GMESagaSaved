<p>Let’s avoid the political topic…as everyone saw over the last 5 years it has the ability to tear families apart.</p>
<p>Let’s put that aside and focus on the MOASS.</p>
<p>If the sub starts going down the political route we are doomed.</p>
<p>For all we know Shitadel et al. only offered money to certain party Congressman to create the divide in apes.</p>
<p>Think about it.  What better way to destroy the camaraderie among apes than to make the MOASS and GameStop political.  It’s their last ditch effort that we would never see coming.</p>
<p>Ape don’t fight ape has never needed to be remembered more than right now.  This is a divide and conquer tactic and a massive trap for 🦧.</p>
<p>Be Smart. Don’t fall into the political trap.</p>
<p>🙌💎🦧🚀🌚</p>
<p>Edit:  for those apes that have interpreted my post to mean something different than I had intended.</p>
<p>Politicians should be exposed. period.  It was the partisan debate that started forming that we all know leads to know where.</p>
<p>The “political trap” that I reference is the divide that natural happens when people start infighting and not realizing that politicians want us to do exactly that. Fight amongst ourselves. </p>
<p>Let’s not do that.  The prize is the MOASS. </p>
<p>Stay vigilant and focus on the common thread of why we are all here.</p>
