    "selftext": "Let\u2019s avoid the political topic\u2026as everyone saw over the last 5 years it has the ability to tear families apart.\n\nLet\u2019s put that aside and focus on the MOASS.\n\nIf the sub starts going down the political route we are doomed.\n\nFor all we know Shitadel et al. only offered money to certain party Congressman to create the divide in apes.\n\nThink about it.  What better way to destroy the camaraderie among apes than to make the MOASS and GameStop political.  It\u2019s their last ditch effort that we would never see coming.\n\nApe don\u2019t fight ape has never needed to be remembered more than right now.  This is a divide and conquer tactic and a massive trap for \ud83e\udda7.\n\nBe Smart. Don\u2019t fall into the political trap.\n\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udda7\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a\n\nEdit:  for those apes that have interpreted my post to mean something different than I had intended.\n\nPoliticians should be exposed. period.  It was the partisan debate that started forming that we all know leads to know where.\n\nThe \u201cpolitical trap\u201d that I reference is the divide that natural happens when people start infighting and not realizing that politicians want us to do exactly that. Fight amongst ourselves. \n\nLet\u2019s not do that.  The prize is the MOASS. \n\nStay vigilant and focus on the common thread of why we are all here.",
