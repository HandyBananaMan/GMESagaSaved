    "selftext": "So I don't know about you all but the sudden surge of calling for DFV to return has me thinking its the next round of FUD somehow. \n\nHe doesn't owe anyone anything and he's not going to come out of his hole just because everyone shouts his name loudly. \n\nI feel like this is somehow an attempt to trap him into responding and becoming the \"scape goat\" for SHF to sue. \n\nJust be Zen. Buy & Hold that's all. The DD is all you need. Everything else is just fun extra stuff to kill time while we wait for MOASS.\n\nApe Strong Together\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 1: as many have pointed out they are using this as potential to let the price rip up a few hundred when he tweets, thus making it seems as if he had some sort of hold on the market or is manipulating the stock. \n\nThat and after no response from calling out to him they could push the narrative of \"he sold\", \"he has paper hands\" \"we already peaked\" etc. \n\nBuy and hold still remains the way",
