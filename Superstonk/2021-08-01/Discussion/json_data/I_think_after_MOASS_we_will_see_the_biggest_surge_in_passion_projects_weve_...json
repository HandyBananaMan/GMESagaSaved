So many smart Apes out here, just look at the DD and creative thinking/artistic talent that gets thrown around here daily, and for most this is a \u2018side hustle\u2019. \n\nIt truly jacks my tits thinking about all of the wild and crazy shit we will see coming from this community when we are no longer burdened by all of the things that kill our great ideas. Wether it\u2019s charity, giving back, smart new business ideas, or creative outlets like arts, we are going to see some major change. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to support each and everyone one of you crazy apes\u2019 new ventures, and I think this more than anything keeps me going. Having 100% freedom to do what we want to do, and knowing if it\u2019s not profitable who cares. You\u2019ll be investing in yourself, as well as the greater good of our communities, and that\u2019s just awesome. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc Apes, the day is coming. We are the MOASS generation.",
