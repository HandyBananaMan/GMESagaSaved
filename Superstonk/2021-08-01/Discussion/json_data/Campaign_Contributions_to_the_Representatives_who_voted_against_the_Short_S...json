Wells Fargo to a slightly lesser extent also.\n* The **DTCC** and other clearinghouses are on some of these lists. Yes, that DTCC!!!!!\n* Remember this is only the Reps on the Financial Services Committee who voted against this bill. The bill will at some point go to the House floor for a full vote. Call, email, tweet at, do everything to contact your Reps that may be on this list and request an answer to why they voted against a bill that goes against the best interests of their constituents. Demand answers!\n\nedit 1: some of you have also pointed out that the **OCC (options clearing corp)** is also on this list, yikes!\n\nedit 2: u/probablyannsaplant pointed out that you can use [opensecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org) to do the inverse and look at where, for example, Ken Griffin donated money. It really is a great tool for seeing the corruption that permeates the system.\n\nedit 3: u/deal_ambitious made an excellent suggestion of cross referencing these institutions with those that fund the politicians who voted in favor. Summarized findings:\n\n* Blackstone is common on the yes voters as well.\n* The DTCC is actually **more commonly** found on the yes voters top 20 lists than the no voters.\n* UBS is less common on yes voters, but still on some of their lists. Same with Wells Fargo\n* Bank of America is **nowhere to be found** on the lists of yes voters! Nor is Bk2 Holdings.\n* I want to re-emphasize that last point. **Bank of America is an extremely common donor to the No voters, and non-existent in the top 20 lists of yes voters. BK2 holdings as well**",
