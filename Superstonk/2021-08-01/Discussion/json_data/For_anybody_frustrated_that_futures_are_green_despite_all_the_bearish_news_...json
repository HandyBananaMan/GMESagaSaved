    "selftext": "Remember Burry said in the Big Short that markers you\u2019re in a speculative bubble are increased incidence of fraud and increasing complexity in financial instruments. Two checks there for anybody paying the slightest bit of attention to GME. I\u2019d also add the obvious that in a bubble prices run far away from true valuations.\n\nFutures green despite no new debt ceiling, no extensions on eviction moratoriums for renters, reverse repo over 1 trillion, new covid variants, noticeable inflation, grocery stores with empty shelves, and many other ominous markers is exactly what we should expect when we remember that Wall Street is fraudulent. It\u2019s a proof we\u2019re getting closer to the end not further away from it. They can\u2019t stop the inevitable only delay it while the big players work to get their ducks in a row as best they can.",
    "title": "For anybody frustrated that futures are green despite all the bearish news, this is like in \u201808 where big banks weren\u2019t marking swaps accurately despite the bottom falling out of the mortgage industry.",
