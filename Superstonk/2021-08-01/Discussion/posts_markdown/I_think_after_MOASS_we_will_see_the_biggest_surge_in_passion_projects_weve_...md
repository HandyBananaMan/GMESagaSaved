The more I think about how life will be different, I can’t help but think of all of the things I would have loved to do, if I had the time or the money. So many smart Apes out here, just look at the DD and creative thinking/artistic talent that gets thrown around here daily, and for most this is a ‘side hustle’. 

It truly jacks my tits thinking about all of the wild and crazy shit we will see coming from this community when we are no longer burdened by all of the things that kill our great ideas. Wether it’s charity, giving back, smart new business ideas, or creative outlets like arts, we are going to see some major change. 

I can’t wait to support each and everyone one of you crazy apes’ new ventures, and I think this more than anything keeps me going. Having 100% freedom to do what we want to do, and knowing if it’s not profitable who cares. You’ll be investing in yourself, as well as the greater good of our communities, and that’s just awesome. 

💎🙌🏼 Apes, the day is coming. We are the MOASS generation.
