I just noticed the forum sliding getting thicker and thicker and wanted to remind everyone that Point72 and Steve Cohen didn't get their fair share of attention.

I know people in the background are working on fresh DD, but I will in the meantime pledge to downvote any low effort Kenny face memes and upvote ANYTHING that mentions point72 or Steve Cohen. Even low effort Cohen face Memes, this is placeholder text to automod doesn't nuke me.
