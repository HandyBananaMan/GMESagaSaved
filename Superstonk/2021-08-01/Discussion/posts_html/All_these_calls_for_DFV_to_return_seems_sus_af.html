<p>So I don't know about you all but the sudden surge of calling for DFV to return has me thinking its the next round of FUD somehow. </p>
<p>He doesn't owe anyone anything and he's not going to come out of his hole just because everyone shouts his name loudly. </p>
<p>I feel like this is somehow an attempt to trap him into responding and becoming the "scape goat" for SHF to sue. </p>
<p>Just be Zen. Buy &amp; Hold that's all. The DD is all you need. Everything else is just fun extra stuff to kill time while we wait for MOASS.</p>

<p>Edit 1: as many have pointed out they are using this as potential to let the price rip up a few hundred when he tweets, thus making it seems as if he had some sort of hold on the market or is manipulating the stock. </p>
<p>That and after no response from calling out to him they could push the narrative of "he sold", "he has paper hands" "we already peaked" etc. </p>
<p>Buy and hold still remains the way</p>
