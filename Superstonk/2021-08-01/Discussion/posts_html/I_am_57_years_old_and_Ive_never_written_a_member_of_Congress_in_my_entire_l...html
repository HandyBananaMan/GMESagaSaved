<h1>Title: I am 57 years old and I've never written a member of Congress in my entire life before this. But Barry Loudermilk of Georgia is my representative and voted against the Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act and I wrote him today. No bad language. Here's the text of it. (How did I do?)</h1>

<p>Dear Mr. Loudermilk -</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I want to let you know how very disappointed I am by your vote against The Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act. As far as I can tell, you are the only Georgia representative to vote against this attempt to address the great corruption in the way our stock markets operate and I am baffled as to what your possible reasons could be. I know that the bill did pass the House and will probably not pass the Senate, but what could that matter to you? You had one chance to represent the so called "Retail Investors" of our country with your vote and you did not do it. This matters a great deal to me and I wanted to tell you so. </p>

<p>I am just one citizen and I am not a very political person. But I do have a great love of the United States and I believe that the big banks and hedge funds who have corrupted the way our stock markets are being run to such a disastrous degree will need to be reined in one day. It's a pity you have chosen to be against something which is so obviously needed. Anyway, i doubt if you will care  very much about the concerns I've expressed here or even if you will ever read this far down into my message. You are a member of Congress and I am simply a citizen. But I want you to know if you do happen to read down this far that I will never forget your failure to act when the people needed you to do it. I will vote for anyone who runs against you and it will not matter very much to me which party that other candidate is from. I will also share my opinions with my family and friends who are also resident in your district and do my very best to persuade them to act the same way at the next election. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
