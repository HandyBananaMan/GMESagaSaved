<h1>Title: For anybody frustrated that futures are green despite all the bearish news, this is like in ‘08 where big banks weren’t marking swaps accurately despite the bottom falling out of the mortgage industry.</h1>

<p>Remember Burry said in the Big Short that markers you’re in a speculative bubble are increased incidence of fraud and increasing complexity in financial instruments. Two checks there for anybody paying the slightest bit of attention to GME. I’d also add the obvious that in a bubble prices run far away from true valuations.</p>
<p>Futures green despite no new debt ceiling, no extensions on eviction moratoriums for renters, reverse repo over 1 trillion, new covid variants, noticeable inflation, grocery stores with empty shelves, and many other ominous markers is exactly what we should expect when we remember that Wall Street is fraudulent. It’s a proof we’re getting closer to the end not further away from it. They can’t stop the inevitable only delay it while the big players work to get their ducks in a row as best they can.</p>
