<p><em>Robinhood's revenue rocketed to $522.2 million in the first three months of the year, up from $127.6 million a year earlier. It lost $1.4 billion during the quarter, but that was almost entirely to account for a $1.5 billion change in the value of liabilities it has related to debt and warrants that it issued in February. It's coming off a profitable year, where it earned $7.4 million after losing $106.6 million in 2019 and $57.5 million in 2018.</em></p>

<p>...And it's PFOF cashcow is under scrutiny and may very well be banned from the market. </p>
<p>75%-81% of RobinHood's revenue comes from PFOF.</p>
<p>And yet, RobinHood is currently valued at: $29.37Bil</p>
<p>https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD?p=HOOD</p>
<hr />
<p>So you have a company like RobinHood with a shrinking customer base (we know, because we <em>were</em> the base)... has lost money every year of it's existence except one (a $7mil profit)... has the possibility of losing 81% of that already negative revenue... and is looking to be down around -$1,000,000,000 so far this year...</p>
<p>Then you have a company like GameStop:</p>
<p>https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME</p>
<p>Current value: $11.9Bil</p>
<p>Growing and loyal customer base... growing profits and Net Income YOY (https://ycharts.com/financials/GME/income_statement/quarterly)... made more actual Net Income in the first quarter of 2021 than RobinHood has made in the life of its company... growing distribution network... growing product lines outside of console gaming... and Ryan (f'ing) Cohen at the helm.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you were going to invest in a turn-around story (because that is what RobinHood is as well)...</p>
<p>Would you rather invest in the shrinking company that's already valued 3 times higher? </p>
<p>Or the growing company that's currently valued 3 times less?</p>
<p>Make no mistake... these are both retail companies. GameStop sells physical items. RobinHood sells your info. They are still both retail sellers, none-the-less; just with different products.</p>
<p>So when you hear people repeating that there is no value in GameStop... you have to wonder what value they see in RobinHood, when it's three times more expensive at the moment, and is currently staring down a $1billion loss for the year so far...</p>
<p>Don't let them gaslight you based on the per-share price. It's the market cap that matters.</p>
<p>And the price is wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p>Since it looks like some people outside of SuperStonk might see this post, I'd like to clarify a few things...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This post wasn't to bash RH (although it is worthy of bashing), it's to show the disparity in how the media treats the value of GameStop vs something like Robinhood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underwriters of an IPO can't lend out shares to short for the first 30 days. So, no, I'm not telling you to go short some $Hood on Monday... it's fairly impossible to do in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though the per-share value of GameStop looks high to you... it is actually 3 times cheaper than RH when comparing the value of the company. The media does not explain market cap vs share price to you. They just want you to see a high price and scare you off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not financial advice. When I was a young boy in Bulgar...</p>
