Rule SR-FINRA-2020-041 - Another rule squeezing those bad actors 

Rule SR-FINRA-2020-041 has been approved after being proposed in Nov 2020. I have not gone through the detail including the letters and comments submitted as part of the review process. The process has taken a while and there was a predetermined deadline of July 30, 2021 to approve or disapprove....hey presto its approved.  

Just my own quick interruption....It appears that some 'firms' are consistently and willingly recruiting rogue employees with a history of misconduct, who then go on continuing to break the rules. Firms who employ these people will now either have to get rid of those rogues or pay financial deposit that is not accessible by the firm who pays it, the amount reflects the risk of employing such people. Firms will also be publicly displayed as a 'RESTRICTED FIRM' to give investors more transparency about the risk associated with a firm relating to the people it employs. 

If I was to read between the lines, Firms are pro-actively employing rogue traders who have breached the rules previously because they are EXACTLY the type of people who will happily comply with their new employers request to break more rules, commit crimes, manipulate systems, cover evidence, turn a blind eye to fraud, lie to regulators, mis record data etc etc. Why are these rogue new employees also attractive.......................... THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO WHISTLE BLOW OR SQUEAL. These firms are rogues, who are employing rogues, who make money for more rogues!!

I've not read through the entire document or response letters from firms. I'm sure more juicy info to find!

"This proposal is designed to address persistent compliance issues that arise at some FINRA member firms that generally do not carry out their supervisory obligations to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations and FINRA rules, and act in ways that could harm their customers and erode confidence in the brokerage industry.19  According to FINRA, recent academic studies have found that some firms persistently employ registered representatives who engage in misconduct, and that misconduct can be concentrated at these firms.20  FINRA states that these studies also provide evidence that the past disciplinary history and other regulatory events associated with a firm or individual can be predictive of future events.21  While these firms may eventually be forced out of the industry through FINRA action or otherwise, FINRA observed that these compliance issues include a persistent, if limited, population of firms with a history of misconduct that may not be acting appropriately as a first line of defence to prevent customer harm"
