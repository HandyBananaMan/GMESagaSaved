<p>As a parent, I can tell you that I have very few places to buy toys that aren't complete crap. I typically end up somewhere like target...who has toys but not really a good selection. Do I want to go on Amazon for toys? Well typically, I have to. Now I don't want to go into a gamestop to have to buy playdoh or action figures....but I sure as hell would buy them from gamestop.com. </p>
<p>The toys on gamestop.com are a good start but let me be frank that plushes are a waste of money to parents of small children. They are easy to come by for much cheaper elsewhere. My kids want play doh, outdoor toys, slime, toddler Legos, giant action figures....you get the idea. Expand the offering for 2-5 year Olds. We have nowhere else to go and those toddlers will eventually grow up....brand loyalty anyone?</p>
<p>Offer these types of things online and before the Christmas shopping season and you have a shitload of customers who are sick of poor toy selections and have childhood nostalgia of GameStop.</p>
