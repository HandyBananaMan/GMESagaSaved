I just want a plan to buffer the attention until I can emerge from my cave of tendies since I\u2019m a young ape in my twenties.\n\nEdit 2: yo dis be my most popular post I think; hi mum, I wanna thank god, me mum, and DFV. but srsly thanks for the awards. I actually read every single comment and commented where I wanted. Y\u2019all some funny mofos.\n\nknow for one that I may or may not have told personal acquaintances along this 8 month journey that I was in GME; dad, step-mom, brother, a few friends, etc.\n\nAs time has gone on, and the seriousness of the MOASS has become more and more real, I\u2019ve become less and less confident in the imaginary, idealistic reality, that my family members/friends would not view me different, grow to resent me, expect things, maybe even do some shady shit. Certainly, NOTHING will be the same.\n\nSo, I encourage everyone who is in the same boat as me - where close associates are aware of your poison in GME and intention to sell at $55M+ \u2014 to lie when the MOASS happens. \n\nWhen they blow up your phone during MOASS telling you to sell and \u201cmake back your investment\u201d at $10,000 a share like a \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc just tell them you did.\n\nIt\u2019ll be better that your close associations think you made $100k then for them to know you have $100M+.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to lie. \nIt\u2019s okay to think of yourself.\nPower to the Players.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",
