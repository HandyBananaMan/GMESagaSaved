<p>This is AWESOME!</p>
<p><strong>Quick Background:</strong> If you've been following my previous posts, I've been tracking deep OTM puts that have no reason to exist other than as a married put [*1] hiding GME naked short shares. I've been waiting for the end of July so I can buy July options data to track the deep OTM puts just like I did for my post about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oenvoh/peekaboo_i_see_103m_hidden_shorts_part_deux/">103M naked shorts hidden back during the Jan sneeze</a> as we had at least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oiemiu/peekaboo_i_see_30m_hidden_shorts_coming_due/">30M hidden shorts coming due with the July 16th expiration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Peek-A-Boo!  Puts, Where Are You???</strong></p>
<p><em>Seriously!  Where are you!!!</em>  I took two snapshots of the July options data at July 12th and July 29th [*2] and then summed up all the put open interest for options that are available to trade as of July 29th (the others would've expired).  <strong>I FOUND ALMOST NOTHING!</strong> AND IT'S <em>WONDERFUL</em>! Take a look:</p>
<p>||As of 7/12/2021|As of 7/29/2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Open Interest for Puts|466,949|500,127|</p>
<p><em>Only</em> <strong>33,178</strong> new puts were opened during the July 16th expiration.  <strong>33k TOTAL NEW PUTS!</strong>  Compare that to January 2021 when over 1M worthless junk put options were opened (delta &lt;= 0.01).  In July, the <em>total</em> puts opened was <strong>33k</strong>!</p>
<p>We've been tracking these deep OTM puts because they have no reason to exist other than to hide shorts.  So, <em>wut happened?</em></p>
<p><strong>DTC-2021-005</strong></p>
<p>DTC-2021-005 was passed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7jyho/srdtcc2021005_was_approved_last_night/">June 25</a> and active on the Federal Register as of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oasn0z/srdtc2021005_active_on_federal_register/">June 30</a>.  This one is important because DTC-2021-005 makes it so "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ntg2ya/dtc2021005_is_supposed_to_be_the_regulatory/">Short/naked options selling or buying won't be possible: HF will need to have the shares when buying puts or selling calls</a>." Until 005 passed, SHFs were simply abusing the puts as a cheap way to hide shares.</p>
<p>DTC-2021-05 changed the game so that for the HFs to go this deep OTM, they need to be <em>fully collateralized</em> for those shares which now makes it very expensive to use new puts to hide shorts.  It's now so expensive that they might as well just buy the shares!  This new rule change means this is no longer a good hiding place for short shares.</p>
<p><strong>WOOHOO!</strong></p>
<p>Will they hide the shares elsewhere?  Probably.  Almost certainly, actually.  Even so, this is a <strong><em>huge win</em></strong> as we've <em>eliminated</em> 1 of their most abused hiding places.  Now that the married puts got divorced from the naked shares, they need to find a new place to crash. We'll keep tracking them, finding them, and exposing them until they have no place to hide! üöÄüåù</p>

<p>[*1]  I'm sticking with the married put terminology because that's what the SEC calls them in this <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf">paper</a> and it's from the original DD I learned from.</p>
<p>[*2]  July 30 is an options expiration so it was easier to grep on July 29th to isolate just that days' data rather than the 30th which would've gotten that days data plus all the options expiring that day.</p>
