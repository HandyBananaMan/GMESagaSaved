<p>Good Day fellow Apes!</p>
<p>Welcome to another edition of me telling you things look bullish as fuck.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well because, it does, the technical indicators look bullish because the stock should be up. The massive amount of capital deployed by short hedge funds to suppress price action doesn't mean that when it finally rips it will be any less glorious than indicated. Time is the factor here. I will dive into that later and how we can watch the shorts getting squeezed in real-time.</p>
<p>But in the interest of full disclosure I will attempt to reign in my absolute positivity on the stock this week, and try to show all the possible price action within the bullish and bearish ranges.</p>
<p>This way we can attempt to find the lowest possible low and highest high. (Please remember this is a volatile asset and these predictions cannot take things like illiquidity and bid/ask spread into account)</p>
<p>I have attempted to avoid this in the past to discourage people from day-trading the stock. However, I have come to realize that people are going to do what they are going to and I can't stop them. I think this information is beneficial to apes as it can help time dip buy opportunities and prevent feelings of negativity from propagating. With knowledge comes confidence. So this will be a test I suppose of Apes sentiment towards this. If the community prefers I will go back to only looking for bullish breakouts opportunities. Let me know I will be paying attention to the comments.</p>
<p>Let's dive into what's new, what isn't, and take a look at some other factors affecting GME this week.</p>
<p>As always I will post a consolidated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial">Video DD of this on my YouTube</a> for those of you that don't have the time to read through this, or have visual impairments/reading comprehension issues. This will be uploaded by...</p>

<h1>Part I: Technical Analysis</h1>
<p><strong>Section 1: Ascending Triangle</strong></p>
<p>Well we drooped slightly below the expected floor on the ascending wedge this week. About $3.6 billion was spent via  GME and ETF's to continue to drive the price down over the last week. It looks like we have found a solid support below VWAP but expected price action seems to indicate that we have around an 11.45% chance of dropping down to the lower theoretical support. A bounce on this trend would confirm a double bottom with a (74.55%) chance of an upside breakout.</p>
<p><img alt="Big Picture of possible technical trends on the 1D timescale" src="https://preview.redd.it/ivqu7e53wse71.png?width=2456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e9fbbe3fa2977b3cb4b24c951b8c31fff7bb50f" /></p>
<p>So let's zoom in on that potential price action and the double bottom as that is what we will be looking at for this week. I know this is a lot take your time with it if you must.</p>
<p><img alt="A closer look at possible expected trends for this coming week on the 1D" src="https://preview.redd.it/6mp35tykxse71.png?width=2462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6f9228e0bb3013d3cb10dd3dd69d12c874777d0" /></p>
<p>This seems like we are due for a bounce but the odds of a bullish trend off the current support look very good but as we know with this stock sometimes things don't go as planned. Also, If you look closely there is overlap in the first three days of predicted price action this over lap has a higher probability of being true. So let's look at some other indicators to support our thesis.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>MACD</strong></p>
<p>So Monday we had a small crossover on the MACD unfortunately no volume came into support it and it was followed by a bearish crossover. We have actually had this same exact situation occur around the time I first started doing TA on this sub after the first ATM offering in April. So I am not super surprised to see one here as well. The last false crossover lasted 4 days this most recent one was 2. So I will go ahead and assume if we do continue on a flat or bearish trend it should be about 4 days long carrying us to Thursday of this week at which point we should see some divergence.</p>
<p><img alt="MACD on the 1D" src="https://preview.redd.it/nfb1prptzse71.png?width=1583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25afec2a3d58f6847bbaee073f3d9b0a4a8c01b6" /></p>
<p><strong>Stochastic RSI</strong></p>
<p>As volume continues to remain really low I have kept this pretty smoothed at 14/14/21. It still looks bullish after the KD crossover and has plenty of range till it reaches oversold.</p>
<p><img alt="StochRSI on the 1D timescale" src="https://preview.redd.it/8yv1ti3s0te71.png?width=1580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a806136440640123c7ff559e1c2c52ba0a20a80" /></p>
<h1>RSI</h1>
<p>RSI is oversold on the 6 and approaching oversold on 14. This indicates we have a little more room for the downtrend to continue but are way overdue for a bounce.</p>
<p><img alt="RSI 6 @ 24.80 and RSI 14 @ 35.32 on the 1D" src="https://preview.redd.it/rskdjonybte71.png?width=1596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daa5d4ec3d183d82622c553998b962e0a15e0aa2" /></p>

<h1>Part II: The Bear Trap</h1>
<p><em>*This is reposted from my dailies to give it more exposure. If you follow daily you can skip this*</em></p>
<p>The long funds have already begun building the gamma ramp up again behind the price drop as can be seen reflected here in the increase of OTM calls this week.</p>
<p><img alt=" Contract volume bought at or near ask for week of 7\/30 " src="https://preview.redd.it/kw4hpb7mdte71.png?width=340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab676319465c9507bd791d1faf32d39a2c29a61" /></p>
<p>As we can see the longs are buying cheap OTM calls and the shorts are buying expensive ITM puts to drive the price down as can be seen here in dollars spent</p>
<p><img alt="Capital flow into GME options for week of 7\/30" src="https://preview.redd.it/h9p8h9lpdte71.png?width=339&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fd5723ffe17999be473fd0db1576f4a154a4a38" /></p>
<p>I will try to explain this long strategy as simply as I can because this is the third week in a row it has occurred.</p>
<p><img alt="Bear Trap Flowchart (de-hedged is not proper terminology but easy to understand)" src="https://preview.redd.it/ayjuu9urdte71.png?width=2053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47051e8cffb64bce255aced101595dd4ff4ee3be" /></p>
<p>This is one of the primary reasons we are not seeing a lot of volume as the longs are aware that the shorts are the seller and the buyer they simply have to wait. This is what I like to call the SHFCJ (Short Hedge Fund Circle Jerk) Eventually once they are done slathering themselves with mayo there will always be this gamma trap waiting for them. Thank you for attending my TED talk.</p>
<p><strong>An Additional Note:</strong></p>
<p>Something I have made clear on my stream but maybe not so much here on reddit this is the longs squeezing the shorts. Forcing them to thread the needle between possible retail FOMO and a massive gamma ramp.</p>

<h1>Part III: The Market</h1>
<p>This is a big one this week as the administration could no longer extend the eviction moratorium via Executive Order, due to a recent Supreme Court ruling. The onus has been passed onto Congress right as they break for District Work Period. While I'm sure something will happen to push this down the road and the actual economic impacts won't be realized for 30-180 days depending on the states, the news could be enough to shake the market. So let's reanalyze our possible correction zones and see if JPOW can prop this shit up for another week.</p>

<h1>Part IV: Conclusion</h1>
<p>Looking like we have good bounce opportunities but there is still room for a few more downward days. The market appears to be teetering on the verge of collapse but as long as sentiment and the FED stay bullish it can carry on much longer. If you guys have any question feel free to ask them down below. Also I'm still watching T+2 on Monday &amp; Tuesday for Market Makers to cover their gamma exposure, which is significant.</p>
