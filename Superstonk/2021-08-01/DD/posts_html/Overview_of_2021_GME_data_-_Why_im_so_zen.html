<p><em>*disclaimer I type with my face and I cannot read, this is not financial advice and shouldn't be taken as such. I'm a stranger on the internet using this as my diary for MOASS. This is just data about a stonk I'm in love with and we rock each others worrrrrrrllddddd*</em> </p>
<p><strong>MAJOR EDIT - In my sleep deprived state I messed up the calculations for float vs total outstanding shares. I had worked out 215% - 860% ownership on total shares outsanding after talking about the float. The real numbers could actually be 541% - 2166%</strong></p>
<p>Good evening Apes, I've been asked for a while to post an update and at first I was worried that the info I would share would encourage day trading and also with how confident I am in the DD I just didn't really feel the need to make a new post. There are now a lot of new apes though who aren't as zen and probably are looking for that sweet sweet confirmation bias, so here it is! </p>
<p><strong>1) A quick recap</strong> </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/vh8pdowfgse71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b53a51e9cc667d4f2b563b7ae3aec6fb087a5ed9</p>
<p>Michael Burry was the first one to notice that GME was an insane situation and was long on the stock way before any of us likely thought about investing in the company. Back in January GME had a reported SI% of 140% which is somehow the legal max, which really makes no sense at all. I don't think I need to explain his tweet anymore, there will never be another GME. </p>

<p>I have nothing to really say about DFV but bringing up Burry for raising awareness on GME, it didn't feel right not mentioning DFV and also mention that this isn't just dumb money FOMOing into a random stock there is a ton of incredible research by thousands of (if not more) people. Look at the top posts all time on Superstonk to get a look if you're new there is so much stuff here worth a read. </p>
<p><strong>2) The Float - with a little bit of volume.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="American dates don't do a confused scare euro apes. " src="https://preview.redd.it/2uiuf9841se71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c1ec4a8e98f91e6c6ebf841025c1c53287e55cd" /></p>
<p><img alt="credit u\/bwajuk " src="https://preview.redd.it/z1fhfyq51se71.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd535ba511b1c25fe666ecae005327debd45797f" /></p>
<p>This info is now slightly outdated but I really like how it breaks down the float which is why I've still used this info, since this graphic was made GME has completed two share offerings, offering a total of 8.5 million shares which raised over $1B in capital, not sure if you know anything about companies or if you're just here because you like the stock but when you have a cash reserve of over $1B dollars and no debt, it's pretty hard to go bankrupt. </p>
<p>Quick maths<br />
<strong>21,992,039</strong> (float from pretty picture) + <strong>8.5m</strong> = <strong>30,492,039</strong></p>
<p>Since January a total of <strong>3,303,252,094</strong> (<strong>3.3B</strong>) GME shares have been traded on the NYSE an average of  <strong>22,939,251</strong> per day which is <strong>75.2%</strong> of the total float, <strong>30,492,039.</strong> </p>
<p>So either every single retail investor who owns GME has bought sold and then rebought 0.75x a day for an entire year or someone has shorted this to oblivion and is going to get hammered to helheim by Odin himself. So everyone quickly look at your hands... You saw diamonds didn't you? Fantastic job! The hammer theory checks out.</p>
<p>So we now know the float is roughly <strong>30,492,039</strong> and we know the volume for the year is 3.3B we can speculate retail ownership. Keep in mind total volume is shorts, longs, buys and sells it not just amount of people buying shares.</p>
<p><strong>Speculative Ape Ownership of GME</strong></p>
<p>5% of <strong>3,303,252,094 =</strong>  165,162,604.70 million shares. </p>
<p>Total amount of GME shares that legally exist = <strong>76.82M</strong> </p>
<p>So <strong>IF</strong> Apes accounted for 5% of total volume they would own 215% of ALL outstanding GME shares and 541.66% of the float.</p>
<p>Now I hear you saying there is no way retail could be 5% of total volume....</p>
<p><img alt="Sauce: https:\/\/www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk\/companies\/news\/943354\/retail-traders-now-account-for-more-us-market-volumes-than-mutual-and-hedge-funds-data-shows-943354.html" src="https://preview.redd.it/gekxyd1r9se71.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=048e5cb8d72e45b85f49101a0c3b5b221bc7ede3" /></p>
<p><strong>Did you say over 20%?????</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Give your stonk a good ole rub." src="https://preview.redd.it/rlx6d1t7ase71.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bdc75d097269849b6b2673417414c3b5acf50b1" /></p>
<p><strong>Speculative Ape Ownership of GME - continued</strong></p>
<p>5% of <strong>3,303,252,094 =</strong>  165,162,605 million shares - 541.66% of the float.</p>
<p>10% of <strong>3,303,252,094 =</strong>  330,325,209  million shares - 1083.32% of the float.</p>
<p>15% of <strong>3,303,252,094 =</strong>  495,487,814  million shares - 1624.98% of the float.  </p>
<p>20% of <strong>3,303,252,094 =</strong>  660,650,418  million shares - 2166.64% of the float.  </p>
<p>So <strong>IF</strong> diamond handed apes accounted for this amount of the total volume retail could own somewhere between 541.66% - 2166.64% based on current figures, as this is retails most popular stock and has been for some time even the top estimates here could be conservative but as this is already speculating I'm not going to continue to jack your tits, plus you are all very friendly with your calculators now, you do the math for higher than 20% if you want. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="More confirmation bias but with crayons." src="https://preview.redd.it/jaacx755fse71.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2d19d2fd649c79b07a90137ca5c3d2fb8711f1b" /></p>
<p>"But how big is the surge in retail trading? Analysts and executives say it is difficult to peg an exact figure, but here are some numbers to put it in perspective:</p>
<p>* 25%+: The percentage of overall market trades made by retail investors in July and August 2020, according to Virtu Financial, one of the world’s largest retail market makers. In January 2020 retail was 17.1% of the market. Virtu’s data only goes to November, but retail investors appear to have played an even bigger role in 2021. Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon said on Friday retail can represent up to 32% of total U.S. equity volume."</p>
<p><strong>3) Volume for 2021 by month</strong></p>
<p>Total volume for Jan was crazy.  </p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/3t7s91zlnse71.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e322406bb5d8f8abe64cc50036a1ed7c18e22182</p>
<p>I'm sure you noticed some pretty colours! Thank you for noticing but let me quickly explain them.</p>
<p>Any loss GME made in a day is marked as red or light red 3 if you want to be fancy.</p>
<p>Any gains GME made under 5% in a day are orange (light orange 3)</p>
<p>Any gains GME made over 5% in a day I classed as meme stonk gains and they are of course marked light green 3.</p>
<p>This isn't a joke, four days with well over 100m shares traded in a day. This was a gamma squeeze and the real short squeeze was about to start however retail was locked out! Buying was turned off but shorting continued. The price yoyoed from $70-$500 per share. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/izc6ml6dyse71.png?width=1535&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=968fbb53b851279ee6e64ffc302612c962b00610</p>
<p>The day that confirmed everything for me that the shorts haven't covered, GME bounced from the $40s to $180. What a fucking 24 hours that was.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/kemilyixyse71.png?width=1375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51eec7a71bc8d6865e785afba2d6c99174e0d086</p>
<p>Notice the short interest, not only have they not covered but hedgefunds started shorting everything heavy to try and supress the price. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/i2eqb3wxzse71.png?width=1531&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=348526bd26828eeb3d6e9a4e9b043638e9dec4b5</p>
<p>April seemed to be the start of excessive darkpool usage but towards the end of the month as the T21 cycle kicked shorting then had to ramp back up heading into May. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/0k4p0rl47te71.png?width=1523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d7951ae89a4bdefa40a6e1d5dcb946dc104fc05</p>
<p>A new record high for short percentage and a record low for volume. Full disclaimer here during this run up I had called a cup and handle pattern a few weeks before and once we started moving up pretty swiftly towards the end of May I started taking more days off with collecting data which is why you can see I've got gaps here vs previous months and for June even more gaps. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/e472kj8o7te71.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bc83dc40afb2696ea6a204ec28dfc58c289bb1</p>
<p>Grey area is data I'm missing, if you have it and don't mind sharing that would be great and I will update this. July I have pretty much a full month for as during June I was getting asked a lot of questions by apes who wanted an update on old DD. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/jgkot3338te71.png?width=1327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff92f25f1796894496eb9d7554b05ab8a8e26c09</p>
<p>And July! Smashed the record high for Short percentage and the record low for volume! This makes me very bullish for August and as a result I have been buying as much of the dip as I can and I'm looking forward to buying again on Monday.</p>
<p>The volume data shows what GME looks like during a gamma squeeze and what it looks like through naked short attacks, dark pool manipulation and just general fuckery. The important thing to remember is that short positions don't have to be covered, they have to be closed. When you start covering a short position the price goes up as you are forced to BUY, it is impossible for hedgefunds to have covered or closed positions as the price is wrong and hedgefunds continue taking further losses. </p>
<p><strong>4) Options data proves they haven't covered/closed out</strong></p>
<p>Melvin capital and other hedgefunds planned to cripple gamestop, if gamestop went bankrupt they would hit the "bankruptcy jackpot" saving them on having to pay any tax on the money they would make on their puts and shorts, this is why and how GME was naked shorted so heavily, to avoid paying tax. Just look at the strike price on these puts and the amount of Open Interest. </p>
<p><strong>Important to note every contract is 100 shares.</strong></p>

<p>I was going to go into the market crash and why GME having a negative beta was important but this post has already gone on so long I don't want to melt brains with more data and I have tried to keep this as simple as possible. I will make another post to cover the crash/negative beta and try to keep it as simple as possible. </p>
<p>Thanks so much for going through this post! I haven't gone into crazy detail explaining anything as I believe data is king so if you have any questions about the data feel free to ask either comments or DMs.   </p>
<p>TLDR: There is a lot of DD, a lot of speculation, amazing theories on reddit and for the newer apes this is the data that will confirm a lot of it for you. You'll be able to see what holders from 2020 or early 2021 have experienced and why these holders like myself are so zen. Hedgies haven't covered/closed they are fucked. Apes set high scores.</p>
<p>Keep calm, hold strong and power to the players!</p>
