The following is some \*preliminary\* investigative work analyzing the top 20 campaign contributors for each of the Representatives (on the Financial Services Committee) who voted against the Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act (H.R. 4618: [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr4618](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr4618)). The source for how each Rep on the Financial Services Committee voted: [https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210728/113999/CRPT-117-BA00-Vote006-20210728.pdf](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210728/113999/CRPT-117-BA00-Vote006-20210728.pdf)

The proposed bill is GOOD for retail investors and aims to equal the playing field, something the powers-that-be want no part in. For this, **I focused on campaign contributors that in my opinion benefit from the current unequal market structure that exists now**. This **only scrapes the surface** and only deals with contributors to each Rep's Campaign Committee and not their Leadership PACs. I only looked at the **Top 20 for each** as this took a while as is. The following data comes from [opensecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org) which is a great resource to track political funding. This is by no means comprehensive and is for only the **2020 election cycle**.

Sorry that some got out of order, but there was a lot of merging of images and it was time consuming as is.

For each screenshot, the columns are as follows:

As you can see, McHenry's top 20 campaign contributors are almost all big banks, hedge funds, and investment firms that all benefit from the current market structure. McHenry is also the ranking Republican member on the committee.

Bk2 Holdings begins to appear on a ton of these lists. There isn't much information about them online other than it being a shell company with links to "dark money". They are linked to billionaire HF manager Bruce Kovner ([https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/01/dark-money-coming-from-a-shell-company-near-you](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/01/dark-money-coming-from-a-shell-company-near-you))

I ran out of space for images so will continue this on a Part 2 post along with a TLDR and some summary points. **Steil, Timmons, and Taylor** still to come.

PART 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovziwv/campaign\_contributions\_to\_the\_representatives\_who/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovziwv/campaign_contributions_to_the_representatives_who/)

edit: Please at least check out the summary (TLDR) and edits on Part 2, I think these are more consequential than anything else here.
