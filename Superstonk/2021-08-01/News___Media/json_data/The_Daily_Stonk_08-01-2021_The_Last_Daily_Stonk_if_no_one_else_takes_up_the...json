(edit alright I got one self-harm/suicide report but only because the bots picked up that I mentioned it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd thank you mods for all the hard work you put in and I know there is a lot of negativity at times but I really do believe most of it are just from the loud minority/cautious people who didn't realize how negative/demanding they were and trolls/shills, and considering how big Superstonk is, shill/troll attacks and everything else, you're doing a great job! and keep at it for as long as you're able.\n\nAnd thank you u/rensole for doing the daily news/stonk for so long and despite the negativity at times it was very much appreciated from me and the community. And I know I kind of stole/copied The Daily Stonk but I hope and think you understand it was done in good faith :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If any of you want to give running/making the daily stonk/news** yourself I'd recommend doing it as a group and [here is a post containing how to make The Daily Stonk that I made for running it as a group in discord based on how I made the Daily Stonk myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovpypd/how_to_create_the_daily_stonk/), it's a little bit \"and and and\" but I hope some of it could be useful if someone takes up the torch.\n\nNote u/ViviconsAdventures is one of the people I was working with and he might do a weakly recap/meme recap to some capacity (but probably not as extensive).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd with that said here is the main news that has happened over the weekend so far and I will keep updating the Daily Stonk with new posts over the day till I go to bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5maetl15qe71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e538766f933a9bb69a6e28f960bb4a586440bfc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [\ud83d\udd34Daily Reverse Repo Update 07/30: $1,039.394B - New record\ud83d\udd34](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ouow2m/daily_reverse_repo_update_0730_1039394b_new_record/) - [u/pctracer](https://www.reddit.com/user/pctracer/)\n\n[credit to u\\/pctracer](https://preview.redd.it/m8zkepc35qe71.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=663deb940400caae55dac85f2466a180194cf6d9)\n\n[Congratulations!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDajqW561KM) We did it, the RRP hit 1 Trillion... next 2 Trillion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Enjoy the peace while it last apes.
