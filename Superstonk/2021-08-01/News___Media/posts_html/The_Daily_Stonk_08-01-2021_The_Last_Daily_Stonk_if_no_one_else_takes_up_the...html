<p>The weekend news so far will be under this :)</p>
<p>Alright, an irl thing has occurred (nothing bad just a lot of stuff to do) which means I won't have the time to take care of the Daily stonk and will probably have to put SuperStonk and GME a bit on the backburner (I will still be here lurking and looking at posts when I can and I fully believe in the MOASS), I tried my best to keep it going as I know a lot of you (and me) found it useful, I even tried to make a group to help and I think it was going well but none of us have the time to run it and I won't be able to contribute but oh well for something that was supposed to only be one post, 2 weeks is not bad.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thank you all for your encouragements over the past 2 weeks it's meant a lot and I'm actually surprised at how little negativity there were, I mean I haven't even gotten 1 self-harm/suicide report or anything from Reddit or any negative/shill/fud dm's at all, I'm very impressed. (edit alright I got one self-harm/suicide report but only because the bots picked up that I mentioned it)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And thank you mods for all the hard work you put in and I know there is a lot of negativity at times but I really do believe most of it are just from the loud minority/cautious people who didn't realize how negative/demanding they were and trolls/shills, and considering how big Superstonk is, shill/troll attacks and everything else, you're doing a great job! and keep at it for as long as you're able.</p>
<p>And thank you u/rensole for doing the daily news/stonk for so long and despite the negativity at times it was very much appreciated from me and the community. And I know I kind of stole/copied The Daily Stonk but I hope and think you understand it was done in good faith :)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>If any of you want to give running/making the daily stonk/news</strong> yourself I'd recommend doing it as a group and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ovpypd/how_to_create_the_daily_stonk/">here is a post containing how to make The Daily Stonk that I made for running it as a group in discord based on how I made the Daily Stonk myself</a>, it's a little bit "and and and" but I hope some of it could be useful if someone takes up the torch.</p>
<p>Note u/ViviconsAdventures is one of the people I was working with and he might do a weakly recap/meme recap to some capacity (but probably not as extensive).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And with that said here is the main news that has happened over the weekend so far and I will keep updating the Daily Stonk with new posts over the day till I go to bed.</p>
