<p>Don’t get too ready for a market crash. We all know what it means that the debt ceiling is no longer suspended. We know what it means that the eviction moratorium is over. This doesn’t mean that fuckery isn’t occurring all over the place and the markets will react instantly. Be patient. Buy Hodl Shop. Get your tits jacked if that’s what your into, or go to your zen place if that’s what you need. All in all, don’t expect anything to happen how it’s supposed to.</p>
