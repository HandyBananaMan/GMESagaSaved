<p>Hello Apes and welcome to the evening news. Tonight's story is one brought to us by u/stonkyagraha. Thank you stonkyagraha for this excellent tip. If you have a tip to submit, post it in the sub WeAreAPE for us to dissect and report.</p>
<p><a href="https://reddit.com/link/oubvwm/video/bv1ocuezg9e71/player">Maxine Waters on 07\/28\/2021 proposed a bill for market transparency, in her speech referencing GameStop and the naked shorting situation. Representatives Bill Huizenga, Anthony Gonzalez, and Ann Wagner were the only 3 detractors to vote against the bill. Maxine argued admirably in defense of the bill, but ultimately her hands were tied by the naysayers on the committee. u\/stonkyagraha discovered through the FEC.gov publicly available data that by strange coincidence these 3 naysayers also received monetary donations to their campaigns from Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen.</a></p>
