He went out of his way to **repeat exactly** what he said in his [May testimony](https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-20210505)\n   1. Tweet: \u201cAbout 6 months ago, **a stock went from $20 to $480 and back down to $40, all in a matter of weeks.** I think these events are part of a larger story about the intersection of finance and technology.\u201d\n   2. May Testimony: \u201cWe\u2019ve all come to hear the general story: **a stock that went from $20 to $480 and back down to $40, all in a matter of weeks.** It opened at $162 Wednesday of this week.\u201d\n3. He also very clearly made another follow-up Tweet at the same time that didn\u2019t get much (if any) traction on here, [linking directly to his May testimony](https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-20210505). Judging by the 95% of the comments in the thread about his first tweet, people seemed to have missed what GG was doing here.\n4. What\u2019s special about the May Testimony? He raised all the points we have complained about - **PFOF, % of trades through Off-Exchange and Dark Pools, Firms with Concentrated Marketshare having an unfair advantage and profitability, name dropped Citadel,  short-selling and transparency, total return swaps, bad actors taking advantage of social media (and he goes out of his way to preclude retail investors), bad actors also using algos to scrape social media sentiment, transitioning from T+2 to T+0 and system wide risks of one firm failing. He also mentions on multiple topics that he has his team looking into this.**\n5. And it\u2019s curious how between his testimony in May up until now, retail unrest has gathered even more momentum and has just amplified. Just imagine the sheer number of complaints that have made their way to SEC and other agencies. *And what does GG choose to do?* Re-iterate what he said before, directly referencing GameStop **and** throw in a link, almost like he is saying *\u201cretail, we do hear you and we are working on it\u201d* without making it a big MSM story.\n\nWhatever your thoughts on the man himself and the ability of the SEC to do anything useful, I do think people have missed the point of his tweets. GG can\u2019t come out and make direct accusations, just imagine the army of lawyers Citadel and co have ready, and he can\u2019t go around showing his hand too early either.\n\n* He has to gather evidence for an absolute slam dunk in an area where evidence can be easily hidden\n* His team have to write proposals and recommendations\n* He has to weed out corrupt employees and undo decades of incompetence\n* His new director of enforcement has to put together a case against the most powerful financial institutions around and deal with other ongoing case loads.\n* He has to deal with multiple complex issues that he\u2019s raised in his testimony that require a lot of change \n* And as we are discovering ourselves, there are new things to discover *every day*. \n* But at the same time, he does realise he has a furious retail crowd to contend with, hence the purpose of the tweets.\n\nI know it\u2019s become a meme about GG being in the job for X weeks but when you see his testimony, the points raised, when they were raised, you begin to understand that the direction him, the new director of enforcement and the SEC are going in is a positive one or at the very least, it\u2019s not some vague rambling but it\u2019s something constructive.\n\nAnd it\u2019s genuinely not one that you can change overnight and it\u2019s certainly not one where you show your hand too early. I was actually a big GG detractor before reading the testimony today and when I only saw the first tweet.\n\n**EDIT**: Let me be clear on one thing. Clarifying the tweets does **not** mean I blindly trust GG. His track record is 50/50 and for GameStop, he\u2019s done nothing yet. I also don\u2019t think he or the SEC will do anything in time for the run-up to MOASS. In terms of improving the market, like Ryan Cohen, in the end I will only judge him on his actions rather than words. But in terms of what he has said, I like it and think he\u2019s headed in a good direction.",
