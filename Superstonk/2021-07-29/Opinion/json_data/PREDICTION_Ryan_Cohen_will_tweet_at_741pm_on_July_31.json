    "selftext": "Everyone has seen the 7:41 theories by now. The Bankruptcy Code. The this. The that. That Ryan Cohen followed 7 twitter accounts, reduced that to 4 and now to 1. We have all seen and noticed that.\n\nBUT, I don't see anyone mentioning the fact that both the 7:41pm tweets came on the last day of the month. There was the 7:41pm God Bless USA tweet on May 31 (last day of May). Next one was 7:41pm Brick by Brick tweet on June 30 (last day of June).\n\nI predict that Ryan Cohen's next 7:41pm tweet will be on July 31. Mark your calendars.\n\nThat is all.\n\nEDIT:\n\nLet's make it a little more interesting. I'm gonna double down and say the 7:41pm July 31 tweet will say: \"Can't stop. Won't stop. GameStop.\"\n\nWould you all lose your shits if this came true?\n\n\\---------\n\nEDIT 7:\n\nAlright, it is pretty clear Ryan Cohen has been following Superstonk's 7:41 interpretations. He just posted a tweet at 8:51pm with googly eyes. He is clearly making fun of us all.\n\n[https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1420940035042414595](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1420940035042414595)\n\nIn my defense, I never said he was not going to tweet until July 31. All I am saying is, he WILL tweet at 7:41pm on July 31. Let us wait and see. Two more days to go.\n\n\\---------\n\nEDIT 6:\n\nI have received a few messages suggesting 9:41 (please see the relationship with Steve Jobs and Apple and 9:41 discussed below in EDIT 3). The argument appears to be that could the tweets have actually been fired off at 9:41pm in one region but gets posted as 7:41pm in another region? I don't like this theory because it could very well be that Ryan Cohen posted those tweets from different regions (one could be from Texas and the other could be from California), which means the posted time would be different (because tweets display the local time of wherever it was tweeted from? that's my thought). UNLESS, Ryan Cohen did tweet from two different locations but ENSURED they were both posted at 7:41pm local time. If that is the case, then it is very deliberate and 7:41 does means something specific.\n\n\\-------------\n\nEDIT 5:\n\nu/DancesWith2Socks in the comments points us to a comment by u/kajneb in another 7:41 post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ou2un8/rc\\_has\\_tweeted\\_on\\_multiple\\_occasions\\_at\\_exactly/h6zu6tz/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ou2un8/rc_has_tweeted_on_multiple_occasions_at_exactly/h6zu6tz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nIt's a good theory.\n\n\\----------\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nAlright, I love this 7:41 theory that u/timlee07 has posted in the comment. It relates to our guardian angels. Here are some important bits from the website u/timlee07 leads us to learn about Angel 741:\n\n>Our guardian angels communicate with us through angel numbers and messages that are hidden in these angel numbers.  \n>  \n>Angel number 741 tells you to be more proud of your accomplishments and stop beating yourself down because of things that aren't important. This angel number usually appears when we get in that feeling of melancholy and sadness in life.  \n>  \n>Angel number 741 combines the energies of three numbers. Number 7 symbolizes providence and abundance ...  \n>  \n>... number 4 represents guard ... that there is someone from above ... looking out for you. Nothing bad can happen to you when you have this kind of protection ...  \n>  \n>Number 1 symbolizes genesis and new beginning ... that big changes are going to happen in your life that will affect every segment of it.\n\nOkay, this all sounds a little too fuzzy. BUT, I really like this. Is Ryan Cohen our \"guardian angel\" who is telling us everything will be okay and that we should keep our faith in $GME and keep HODLING? I think so.\n\nThanks u/timlee07\n\n\\------------\n\nEDIT 3: Sorry for the language in EDIT 2. Removed it. Anyway, u/br995 doesn't meet karma requirements to post, so sent me a message with his/her theory about 7:41. Apparently, Ryan Cohen is a fan of Steve Jobs and Apple, and Apple always has 9:41 in its advertisements (I'm guessing the time display shown in Apple's products ads). It doesn't make sense to me because 7:41 and 9:41 are not even close. Anyway, he/she has that theory but I don't agree.\n\n\\-----------\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nWhat is it with you lots and shoving bananas up your holes? Jesus Christ.\n\n\\------\n\n&#x200B;",
