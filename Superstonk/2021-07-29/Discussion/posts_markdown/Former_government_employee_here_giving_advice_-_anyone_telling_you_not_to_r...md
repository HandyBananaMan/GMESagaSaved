I previously worked for the SBA. First of all, they’re public forms / complaint forms. Literally 0 harm in submitting anything to the government. They have a specific division to filter out complaints vs bogus submissions. It’s a whole process. 

They want more evidence. Its like doing their job for them. Not submitting something that may actually assist in an investigation is a disservice. 

The government may be slow but you bet your ass they’re digging now, there’s way too much spotlight on this situation at this point.

If you have something insightful and intelligent to add to the conversation that you think the SEC should be aware of, send it in.

Edit: Also if any business owners here need advice regarding their SBA EIDL loans I’d be happy to answer any questions

Edit 2: also forgot that the FOIA laws that were passed basically means all records need to be kept not deleted. Doesn’t mean you will get a non-redacted request, but it’s there. So get that DD on record if you are confident in your findings.
