    "selftext": "I previously worked for the SBA. First of all, they\u2019re public forms / complaint forms. Literally 0 harm in submitting anything to the government. They have a specific division to filter out complaints vs bogus submissions. It\u2019s a whole process. \n\nThey want more evidence. Its like doing their job for them. Not submitting something that may actually assist in an investigation is a disservice. \n\nThe government may be slow but you bet your ass they\u2019re digging now, there\u2019s way too much spotlight on this situation at this point.\n\nIf you have something insightful and intelligent to add to the conversation that you think the SEC should be aware of, send it in.\n\nEdit: Also if any business owners here need advice regarding their SBA EIDL loans I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions\n\nEdit 2: also forgot that the FOIA laws that were passed basically means all records need to be kept not deleted. Doesn\u2019t mean you will get a non-redacted request, but it\u2019s there. So get that DD on record if you are confident in your findings.",
