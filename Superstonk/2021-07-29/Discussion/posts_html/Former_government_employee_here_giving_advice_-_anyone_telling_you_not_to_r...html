<h1>Title: Former government employee here giving advice - anyone telling you not to report something to the government doesn’t know what they’re talking about, or are lying.</h1>

<p>I previously worked for the SBA. First of all, they’re public forms / complaint forms. Literally 0 harm in submitting anything to the government. They have a specific division to filter out complaints vs bogus submissions. It’s a whole process. </p>
<p>They want more evidence. Its like doing their job for them. Not submitting something that may actually assist in an investigation is a disservice. </p>
<p>The government may be slow but you bet your ass they’re digging now, there’s way too much spotlight on this situation at this point.</p>
<p>If you have something insightful and intelligent to add to the conversation that you think the SEC should be aware of, send it in.</p>
<p>Edit: Also if any business owners here need advice regarding their SBA EIDL loans I’d be happy to answer any questions</p>
<p>Edit 2: also forgot that the FOIA laws that were passed basically means all records need to be kept not deleted. Doesn’t mean you will get a non-redacted request, but it’s there. So get that DD on record if you are confident in your findings.</p>
