<p>I understand, this is a GME sub so why are you talking about another stock. This is about how something in the market is affecting those that are shorting our beloved GME, specifically the bad quarter reported by Amazon. At the time of writing this, the stock is currently down \~7% or $255 after hours. What I find interesting is the institutional ownership. Almost $250M wiped from the big 3 that are betting against GME. Now they have calls and puts probably to hedge these bets and I have no clue how that affects any of this but today was a bad day for them.  This is what margin calls are made of ðŸ˜Š.</p>
