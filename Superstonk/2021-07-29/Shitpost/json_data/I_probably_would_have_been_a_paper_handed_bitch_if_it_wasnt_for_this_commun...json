I love the fact that I can check in on any day, at any time, and there are tens of thousands of my fellow degenerates out here grinding.  \n\nI can now tell people that \u201cI have a guy for that,\u201d on pretty much any subject related to the financial markets.  Shit, I have a guy who has a road sign if I\u2019m feeling down u/mr_boost .  I got a guy who tells me all about the \u201cmythical\u201d Eliot Waves u/possibly6 .  I don\u2019t know what that guy is talking about, but it\u2019s provocative and I like it.  I have several guys that will show me pictures of Fukd hedgies running up their electric bills 24/7.  I fucking love it all!\n\nIf I didn\u2019t have this sub to come to each day to confirm my bias, I probably would have sold at some point and blown my money on something else.\n\nAnyway, I thank all you beautiful wrinkly brained apes that keep me coming back every day.  I also thank all you smooth brained retards out there that ask the retarded questions so that I can  sort of understand what\u2019s going on.\n\nSuperStonk is a helluva drug...\n\nEdit 1: Linked \u201cMy guys.\u201d\n\nEdit 2:  I can\u2019t believe I forgot my favorite TA voodoo guy u/gherkinit .  He draws wonderful pickles and it makes me smile.  Thank you!",
