<p>There’s not a lot to say here... I love the fact that I can check in on any day, at any time, and there are tens of thousands of my fellow degenerates out here grinding.  </p>
<p>I can now tell people that “I have a guy for that,” on pretty much any subject related to the financial markets.  Shit, I have a guy who has a road sign if I’m feeling down u/mr_boost .  I got a guy who tells me all about the “mythical” Eliot Waves u/possibly6 .  I don’t know what that guy is talking about, but it’s provocative and I like it.  I have several guys that will show me pictures of Fukd hedgies running up their electric bills 24/7.  I fucking love it all!</p>
<p>If I didn’t have this sub to come to each day to confirm my bias, I probably would have sold at some point and blown my money on something else.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thank all you beautiful wrinkly brained apes that keep me coming back every day.  I also thank all you smooth brained retards out there that ask the retarded questions so that I can  sort of understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>SuperStonk is a helluva drug...</p>
<p>Edit 1: Linked “My guys.”</p>
<p>Edit 2:  I can’t believe I forgot my favorite TA voodoo guy u/gherkinit .  He draws wonderful pickles and it makes me smile.  Thank you!</p>
