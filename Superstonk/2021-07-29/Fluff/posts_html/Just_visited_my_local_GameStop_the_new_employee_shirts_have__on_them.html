<p>this straight up happened about an hour ago and am still scratching my head wondering if what I witnessed was legit.</p>
<p>I walked into my local GameStop to inquire about PS5s and browse their merchandise - the following conversation occurs</p>
<p>Me: hey, do ya'll happen to have any PS5's?</p>
<p>GameStop: sorry bro, we do not - I'd recommend ordering on Mondays or Wednesdays at <a href="https://Gamestop.com">Gamestop.com</a> to pick up in store... but I've been working here 11 years and <em>I</em> haven't gotten one, so, yeah... it's <em>that</em> hard</p>
<p>M: Ah well I'll have to keep an eye out. Do you happen to have any GameStop shirts?</p>
<p>GS: You mean game related shirts or just straight up "GameStop" shirts <em>*gesturing at chest*</em></p>
<p>M: straight up GameStop</p>
<p>GS: <em>squints at me</em> why?</p>
<p>M: <em>side eye puppet</em> No... particular... reason</p>
<p>(note: I don't really discuss being a shareholder but I think it's safe to say he was on to me at this point)</p>
<p>GS: (smiling now) You want the one with a rocket on it?</p>
<p>M: (after doing a mental double take) ...rocket?</p>
<p>GS: Yes sirrrrr, to the moon! Just got dropped off today!</p>
<p><strong>AND THEN HE SHOWS ME</strong></p>
<p>a plain, black T-shirt with a white "Game" and a red "Stop"</p>
<p>and there on the bottom left side of the shirt, on the hem at the left thigh - was a tiny red tag with a single  ðŸš€  on it. This was not a "look at me I'm rocket GameStop now!!!", this was subtle af.</p>
<p><em>continuing</em></p>
<p>M: Oh my god I don't believe it</p>
<p>GS: as I said to the moon brother</p>
<p>M: These are going to be for sale?!?</p>
<p>GS: No actually, these are supposed to be <strong>only for employees.</strong></p>
<p><strong>----------</strong></p>
<p>The rest was basically shooting the shit. I'm sure this reads decently like an r/thatHappened type yarn, but I know what I saw and I'm here to ask anyone if they have seen anything similar - and if not, to request confirmation that this is legitimate.</p>
<p>I don't believe these are being rolled out quite yet, as the employee (who I'm now guessing was the GM) said they were dropped off today. I didn't want to ask about pictures in case it was something that was not supposed to be evidenced by photo just yet. </p>
<p>My personal simulation has been confirmed, this shit has been real af since January, but it <em>definitely</em> just got real in a totally different, totally sack of diamonds to the chest type way.</p>
<p>Bullish AF.</p>
<p>Any confirmation stories?</p>
<p>for reference I'm in TX, so pretty close to HQ</p>
<p>also, 10/10 experience with the staff at the store, well informed and exceptionally friendly throughout the entire exchange!</p>
