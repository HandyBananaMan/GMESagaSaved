Shorts still must buy back and return the shares they attempted to short. Nothing has changed.

“To sell a stock short, you follow four steps:

1. Borrow the stock you want to bet against. ...
2. You immediately sell the shares you have borrowed. ...
3. You wait for the stock to fall and then buy the shares back at the new, lower price.
4. You return the shares to the brokerage you borrowed them from and pocket the difference.”

Edit: #4 hasn’t happened yet.

Lots of stupid shit about some gathering that isn’t going to happen or will be staged by SHFs and MSM.. it’s FUD and a distraction from the main issues.

Enjoy your weekend, find a way to have fun and relax.

TLDR; don’t let the shilling get to you. buy hodl buckle up, again.
