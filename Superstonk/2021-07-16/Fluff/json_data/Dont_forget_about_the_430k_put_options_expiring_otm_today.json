Borrow the stock you want to bet against. ...\n2. You immediately sell the shares you have borrowed. ...\n3. You wait for the stock to fall and then buy the shares back at the new, lower price.\n4. You return the shares to the brokerage you borrowed them from and pocket the difference.\u201d\n\nEdit: #4 hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nLots of stupid shit about some gathering that isn\u2019t going to happen or will be staged by SHFs and MSM.. it\u2019s FUD and a distraction from the main issues.\n\nEnjoy your weekend, find a way to have fun and relax.\n\nTLDR; don\u2019t let the shilling get to you. buy hodl buckle up, again.",
