<p>Shorts still must buy back and return the shares they attempted to short. Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>“To sell a stock short, you follow four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Borrow the stock you want to bet against. ...</li>
<li>You immediately sell the shares you have borrowed. ...</li>
<li>You wait for the stock to fall and then buy the shares back at the new, lower price.</li>
<li>You return the shares to the brokerage you borrowed them from and pocket the difference.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: #4 hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>Lots of stupid shit about some gathering that isn’t going to happen or will be staged by SHFs and MSM.. it’s FUD and a distraction from the main issues.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend, find a way to have fun and relax.</p>
<p>TLDR; don’t let the shilling get to you. buy hodl buckle up, again.</p>
