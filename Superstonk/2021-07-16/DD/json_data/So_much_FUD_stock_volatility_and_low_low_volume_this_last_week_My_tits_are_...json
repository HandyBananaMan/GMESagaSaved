    "selftext": "Let\u2019s put this bitch into perspective: \n\n\nTeeny tiny volume this last week. No volume, on a stock with hundreds of thousands of activist investors interested in it, is weird. Not just that, the volume has been dipping pretty steadily lately. They used to actively suppress the price. Now? They\u2019re just responding to our buying pressure. They\u2019re running out of their \u201cfuck you\u201d money. BULLISH!\n\n\nFor volatility? Just take a gander at the fucking VIX, baby! Kaboom soon. \n\n\nNext, we had Burry and just a few other eggheads talking about the market\u2019s potential collapse last year. Now? It\u2019s everywhere. J (money printer go brrrrrrr) Powell can\u2019t even contain his negative physical response to Warren\u2019s \u201coptimism\u201d over the banks\u2019 current strength. BULLISH AS FUCK!!\n\nNext, manipulation has really ramped up. I mean, REALLY fucking ramped up! We went for a couple weeks with some really weak-sauce FUD but they\u2019re certainly making up some fucking ground this last week.\n\nMy background: (hold the fuck on. It\u2019ll make sense in a minute) I\u2019m a psych ape and my brain is so wrinkly that it looks like Kenny does in our latest stream of forum sliding memes. I got paperwork proving it but fuck that. Either believe me or tear my post apart, whatever fucking works. Anyway, not only am I a wrinkly psych ape, I\u2019ve dealt with some of the most manipulative, skeezy, horrible piles of excrement that are supposed to be people. I still deal with some of those wastes of oxygen, but I digress. Basically, I\u2019m REAL fucking familiar with manipulation. \n\nWith that in mind, this sub has been the one girl in an 8 man gangbang of manipulation tactics for at least a week. Forum sliding, fake DD, wild conspiracy theories, divisive political discussions, false hype, Mod drama, and much more. Basically, fuckery abounds. \n\nNow, what did we say about the manipulation, in relation to the MOASS? Oh yeah! It\u2019ll fucking pick up, the closer we get to absolution. And this week, fuckery ABOUNDS. \n\nLet\u2019s tie that in with financial experts saying that trillions are about to change hands, this summer. Tits: FUCKING JACKED!\n\nOne last, and probably the most important, morsel. T. PLUS. TWO. Over three hundred FUCKING THOUSAND puts expired out of the money today. How many shares can be hidden in a married put again? I\u2019m pretty damn sure it\u2019s 100. 100 times 300,000 is 30 fucking milli, baby. Half of the fucking float! You know, if fuckery did not abound, that is. \n\nThat means they gotta figure out what the fuck to do before July 20th. My thinking? Hedgies are FUCKED. Oh yeah, and isn\u2019t there some moon party themed thing occurring on the 20th and sponsored by GameStop? \n\nYeah, our venerable queen probably fell for a honey pot. But I mean, really, who hasn\u2019t? Tits, man. They\u2019ll hypnotize you and steal your soul. Anyway, mod drama don\u2019t mean shit. Nobody gives a shit if you care about it. Even less people give a shit if you don\u2019t care about it. Stop fucking karma whoring like the thirsty bitches you are. \n\nThey\u2019re desperate, the stops have been pulled. See you bitches in the winner\u2019s circle. \n\n**TLDR:** fuck you. Read it\u2026. But moon soon. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, rockets. Because I fucking like them, that\u2019s why. \n\nI\u2019m flairing this as DD because I\u2019m analyzing the recent bullshit. Mods can change it if they disagree.\n\nEdit: you\u2019re fucking welcome, u/zenszola",
