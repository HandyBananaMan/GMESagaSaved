    "selftext": "Hello ape people. I'm going to show you stuff today. My [Jacques\\_Tits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Tits)\n\n\\---------\n\n[ETF & GME FTDs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V3oHqaZWM--7_FEcqbXpEPFHZQZeytB18jj0wQr8Z5Y/edit?usp=sharing) \\- 2020 March - 2021 June\n\n[Entire Market Option Trades](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tm3yJnEUK3BVU6yD_MVUzhyQ-KTrQIL5/view?usp=sharing) \\- May 5 - July 15 2021\n\nAttribute me if you will use please.\n\n\\---------\n\nPre-reads if you really want to, but i've included it in this post too so:\n\n* [August 20'th open interest is becoming the new hot potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okvmi9/august_20_option_open_interest_is_becoming_the/)\n\n[ Unrelated, its the duality of apes \\(Sorry to lady apes for not having a less gender specific meme, i just felt that this fits\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/cuuwclgokkb71.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97c5bbd1c1405be68a54a3d9a6b57e40953b59ef)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 0. Myface\n\nEveryone keeps writing 0. Preface. So i'm taking it to the next level by writing \"Myface\".\n\nGonna show you what i think is going on with GME ETFs, GME FTDs, ETF FTDs and their correlation. I won't prove it mathematically because i'm not a mathboi & no one would understand shit anyway.\n\nInstead i'll show you colorful charts drawn with handmade crayons. Also i'll like take a long break before replying to anyone since it's Friday and relaxation, video games and Netflix are a thing. Will also reply depending on mood and reception of this post as i generally dislike negativity and might chose to ignore it entirely.\n\nI swore to never write DD again, but i'm idiosyncratic like a certain stock so here i am again.  \ud83e\udd21\n\nAlso if you hype August 20 you're a clown. Wait and see what happens. Though maybe 1 last dip could be good for our wallets so maybe hype it a little. Do as you wish, you can hype a roof tile for all i care. I'm just here to show you data stuff.\n\nEnjoy my ***\"double down\"*** post dear fellow apes. (Sarcasmus Maximus)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. GME ETF FTDs\n\nNot weighted or anything. Raw GME ETF FTDs for the past 2 months from May to the end of June.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3bgyw5pqjkb71.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b76a59922a8ea17a9da8b4b2fc70e4a89343248a\n\nWhale whale whale. Would you look at that. XRT and IWM have a lot of FTDs, what a surprise (not).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. GME ETFs and GME FTD Correlations\n\nIf you wanna corelate stuff using math, do it yourself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycx0gvsakkb71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=1444384604c845c384d7ba9c88c9d6cacc172c26\n\nThe Orange line is GME.\n\nLook at the 2 first big spiky areas, ignore the last/3'rd one.\n\n1. 17 May\n2. 18 June\n\nThese dates already passed. Let's see what happened on May 17 and June 18 in the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Russel 2000** dumped hard on both dates.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k6cr1kimkb71.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0c4040fdb222c48d50fd0fe2a7bed7db0503ac5\n\n**SPY / S&P500** dumped hard on both occasions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuxxt5ukmkb71.png?width=1983&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a2f0c7b4df8d2d4b66e153260cb40b17a6ff6f\n\nGME was... well being GME...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmm4g2pnmkb71.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dfb8b4de341d34d895a4b235dbe88161fb18053\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Back to the first screenshot**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycx0gvsakkb71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=1444384604c845c384d7ba9c88c9d6cacc172c26\n\nWe established that:\n\n* **17 May:** Boatloads of GME and GME ETF FTDs market was fucked, GME was mostly fine.\n* **18 June:** Boatloads of GME and GME ETF FTDs, market was fucked, GME was mostly fine.\n\nBut wait. If you look at the screenshot above, you'll see a 3'rd date. The 16'th of July which indicates the same open interest spikes in all of the major GME ETFs.\n\nWhat would this mean that would happen on the 16'th of July??? **That's right, more GME FTDs.**\n\n^(I think it's a fairly obvious conclusion to make. Math and 95'th percentiles be damned.)\n\n\\---------\n\n***Conclusion.*** Today they're going to generate a fuckload of FTDs for GME. Start your **T+35** clocks because when those failed to deliver shares have to be bought to be delivered, hedgies r fuk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. GME ETF Open Interest - IWM is insane\n\nHere's the open interest for all options in all GME ETFs. You can see the balance/imbalance of calls vs puts in each GME ETF.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oaezrisrnkb71.png?width=1223&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1bae81c2f91388c118ab59296003e0ee37f6fec\n\n* **XRT:** 80k calls to 271k puts. Call to put ratio of around **1 / 3.2**\n* **IWM:** 49 Million calls to 166 Million puts. Call to put ratio of around **1 / 3.2**\n* **IWN:** 9k calls to 64k puts. Call to put ratio of around **1 / 6.1**\n\n**The rest are too useless to mention. IWM and XRT seem to be the major players in the GME ETF Game.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Weird Metric: All GME ETF Open Interest Max Pain AVG\n\nThis is a weird metric. If you ask any academic people whether this is an accurate metric or a metric at all, they'll tell you: \"wtf are you smoking\". I agree, but still, here it is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlejvv4zokb71.png?width=1911&format=png&auto=webp&s=31a5991d75c138100a432591786a82a455359bff\n\nSomehow, i'm getting an average price of $170 by tallying up all open interest for calls and puts for all GME ETFs (but not GME itself).\n\nI'm getting an average result (Max Pain-like) between $170 - $185. **I know a certain idiosyncratic stock that trades at around those prices.**\n\n**Coincidence?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5. 20'th of August Hot Potato - Open Interest is Increasing\n\nI posted about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/okvmi9/august_20_option_open_interest_is_becoming_the/). The 20'th of August to me looks anomalous. There's been a build up of open interest expiring on that date. In this week the buildup of open interest has accelerated a lot which has raised all kinds of flags for me.\n\nI don't understand what it means yet, but i have theories and who doesn't love theories, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Out of the money puts for August 20: **24000**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5ffv16aqkb71.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=d08c895021269efb24c08e85f71e01b80ae7c128\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# .6 When was this open interest created?\n\nHere's a chart showing that 16000/24000 was created in the last 35 days.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up11otgkqkb71.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=e51083f1b396734db5591ea023b3be1f79076897\n\n1. 16000 OTM puts\n2. Strikes between $0.5 - $160\n3. Expiring on the 20'th\n4. Created in the last 1 month from June 7 to July 14.\n\nWhy not just buy deep OTM puts at $0.5 strikes? What's that???? They can't anymore???? They have to deal with this substandard predictable shit now??? Thank you SR-DTC-2021-005 and other SR rules.\n\nFuck yes. The can kicking game is now being played much more carefully because there's real money at stake for them when buying options now. They have to post full collateral for any options they buy unlike before.\n\nThey have to be careful with what they buy hence this change in strategy. The fact that they're playing this much more careful now tells me they're scared/concerned or not as funded as they'd like to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Also, yesterday the opened another 1750 open interest for August 20**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d24n43d2rkb71.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=628e2f6d3edf385d336f5804701f489ac5fef764\n\nSo yes\n\n* Between ***May - June***, **500** useless puts were opened expiring August 20'th.\n* Between ***June and July*** **18000** useless puts were opened expiring August 20'th.\n\n5500 open interest of that was opened JUST THIS WEEK.\n\n**So yes, it's accelerating. I smell urgency and desperation for something due on the 20'th of August. But hey? What is it?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# .7 HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY, WHAT IS?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5es11pvprkb71.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee44be785e3af66093b83ef26d9fa58076aa9179\n\nWell, if i mark the **16'th of July** which is when all these 500k useless puts expire... and count T+35 days. That day is???\n\n**That's right, 20'th of August!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pp13im6urkb71.png?width=1501&format=png&auto=webp&s=098cc2c988b1cc966c4f29c6dd2c893124c7019d\n\nWow mind blown!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# .8 What usually happens this close to earnings?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcpsvnk1skb71.png?width=1876&format=png&auto=webp&s=98b38f9df829fe0cc66a3f1330c45ae114085486\n\nUsually you get corporate announcements:\n\n* Before earnings,\n* On earnings\n* After earnings.\n\nSo? **What is?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4vv1k7dskb71.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4217103c24b33c0b9c6f5cbc4c9790af251aff2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# .9 DTCC - Corporate Announcement Types\n\nThis is the list of corporate announcements the DTCC provides as a service. Pick one and let your imagination run wild on what could be announced sometime near the 20'th of August (or not).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33k8n3bmskb71.png?width=1510&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de4a5d93e6812179b60ad9f34be4dea4c39b4cb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's zoom in Dear **Wat**son\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7voxr7oskb71.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=29be13d90729093d746e3636707f20b970f5cf6d\n\nI wonder which one of these RC will pick\n\n( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# .10 This Week's Option transactions / Flow\n\nAt least everything from the 12'th to the 15'th overlaid on a strike chart and a seconds chart to show the exact moment of execution of each option trade.\n\n[Yeah i know this one came out of nowhere.](https://preview.redd.it/tmz14cr8tkb71.png?width=1873&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9f88f5adfa72b944784dc08a4d07d2af0d92e2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# .69 Outro\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvuhhcjxtkb71.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ed3f632f9429084232d4387420e67a3808582f6\n\n**Hegges r fuk**\n\n[u/buttfarm69](https://www.reddit.com/u/buttfarm69/) where meme",
