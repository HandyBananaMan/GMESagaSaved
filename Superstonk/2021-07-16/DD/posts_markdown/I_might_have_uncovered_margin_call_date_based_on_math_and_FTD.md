Let's head right into it.So the first ever T+35 occured on 25th January 2021.Counting back these 35 calender days that shouldve started at 21st December 2020. (FTD)

On the 25th January, the price went from \~70$ to 350$ in 2 days.This caught hedgefunds totally offguard. They didnt expect that to happen and force commanded brokers like Robinhood and others to stop the buying pressure as it was uncontrolable.It was a mix of FTD + FOMO + 1st time ever.After that it crashed to \~190$ due to panic selling and not allowing to buy.It ran shortly after to 327$ again for reasons I dont remember.Anyway people couldnt buy, were restricted, and couldnt push for a margin call.Which was at that time the most attractive time for that.So that makes it sure that they have never started closing their short positions. But started to add on more from that date, spreading FUD with media until today, to make us believe the squeeze is 'over'.That we would eventually sell and forget about it. That was the hedgefunds goal.

DFV gave a little more light into this darkness with his share adding and proved that the squeeze was not over. Nothing illegal about anyone buying this stock. And investors simply didnt want to give up on gamestop due to child memories and much more. GameStop means a lot to gamers. And the believe in the company to create a great future in gaming for the community, is there.

Due to shorting that started again from the 29th January, 35 days had passed. The FTD was on the 5th March 2021. The price went from 138$ to 265$ in 7 days.It were 21 days where the price kept rising, if it kept on going, it would've resulted in a margin call.

This attempt was stopped with the shocking flashcrash that we all witnessed that day.

After that, I think, we got the stonkometer showing us all the FTD, Options and so on.I used waybackmachine to find what were the last high OTM Puts and added 35 days until 'covering'.

On 16th April 2021, \~427K OTM Puts were expiring. Adding T+35 Days to that it arrived on the21st May 2021. It caused a runup from \~170$ to \~302$ in 19 Days. (9th June 2021)Shortly after the stock would've crashed anyway and be again shorted.There is were GameStop sold their shares ATM. They took the opportunity to get money which otherwise they couldnt be able to do so. It was like the perfect timing.

Now they had a reason why they shouldn't be shorted and that they can transform to get back on foot with zero debt and money on their hands. Which doesnt justify the shorting any longer.From that point all the shorting is due to not wanting to close their short positions. Meaning the true 'hedgies r fuk' moment.

From the ATM share offering 2 days passed, those 21 days ended. This is when the hedgefunds started to short again to kick the can.Those  OTM puts that expired today on 17th July 2021, were about 437K.Adding T+35 onto them means closing that position is 20th August 2021.

That is when 21 days start were the price surges again. It ends on a Friday 10th September 2021.

Monday is the 13th September 2021. Which is were I would expect Margin Call and where the whole stockmarket will get down to hell.

Not to forget that probably the new delta strain or whatever strain will cause drama and can be used for a maskup. To do anything what is in their power to not let the hedgefunds or anyone else be responsible for the crash of the century.  Because that would certainly upset a lot of people.
