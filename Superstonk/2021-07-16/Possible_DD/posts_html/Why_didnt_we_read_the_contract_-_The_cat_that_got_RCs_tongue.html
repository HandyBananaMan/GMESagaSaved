<p>I opened up the letter between RC Ventures and GameStop. <strong>DAMN</strong> is our boy RC under some pretty strict scrutiny with the standstill period. There some legalese in here that I'll try and break for you to keep it simple.</p>
<p>We know he couldn't speak much, hell we even knew why. <strong>I didn't expect it to be this restrictive though. This is me showing WHY it isn't as easy as:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>"Ryan Cohen better talk soon"</em></strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Okay so straight up, I tried my best not to misinterpret anything. If I did, of course lemmme knowwww.</p>
<p><strong>Further point - this is explicitly about Ryan Cohen. GameStop could speak and they don't. I'm explaining why RC can't.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ape - There is a standstill period. RC Ventures ( including RC himself)  can't do the stuff outlined below until 120 calendar days before the June 09th 2022. (or 30 days before director nominations whichever is earliest. We have a new date boys and girls.</strong></p>
