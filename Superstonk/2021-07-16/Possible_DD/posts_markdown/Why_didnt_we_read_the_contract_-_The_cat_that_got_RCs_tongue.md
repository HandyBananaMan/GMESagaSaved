I opened up the letter between RC Ventures and GameStop. **DAMN** is our boy RC under some pretty strict scrutiny with the standstill period. There some legalese in here that I'll try and break for you to keep it simple.

We know he couldn't speak much, hell we even knew why. **I didn't expect it to be this restrictive though. This is me showing WHY it isn't as easy as:**

***"Ryan Cohen better talk soon"***

&#x200B;

Okay so straight up, I tried my best not to misinterpret anything. If I did, of course lemmme knowwww.

**Further point - this is explicitly about Ryan Cohen. GameStop could speak and they don't. I'm explaining why RC can't.**

I will **bold** the important bits :)

**Ape - Lots of words just to say, Ryan you can't fuck about trying to funnel money around other companies to obtain more than 19.9% of GameStop. However, when this little period is done? Go right ahead you beautiful man.**
