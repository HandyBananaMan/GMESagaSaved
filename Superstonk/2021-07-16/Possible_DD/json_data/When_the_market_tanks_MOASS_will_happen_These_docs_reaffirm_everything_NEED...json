    "selftext": "TLDR: Market tanks and we collect our tendies. MOASS will happen at some point no matter what the catalyst. Patience is everything. The court case referenced below began in 2018 and settled in 2019. \n\nThis is not click-bait or hype. I made another post and it\u2019s getting downvoted by shills and this should be seen because it appears to reaffirm everything. The statement below is quoted from a series of court documents from a 2018 case against LJM Funds related to an ETF and/or mutual fund that includes Citadel, International Brokers, JP Morgan, Virtu, BofA and others. The fund name: the Two Roads Shared Trust and it\u2019s still active today.\n\nFund info and (conspirators) players involved: https://sec.report/Document/0001752724-21-146243/\n\nNote the tickers and the recent DDs that have been posted recently concerning ETFS.\n\n\u201cAnalysts were quick to recognize that the Fund\u2019s losses were unusual and not an indictment of all volatility strategies but merely the result of extreme risk-taking with wholly inadequate risk mitigation or controls. For example, following the Fund\u2019s collapse, Morningstar reported that the Fund had made bets exposing it to \u201cextraordinary risks,\u201d including selling \u201c***naked put options\u201d on S&amp;P 500 futures that caused the Fund to be \u201c\u2018leveraged and [with] above-average margin [borrowing] levels.\u2019\u201d Thus, as the market moved downward, the Fund was subject to margin and risk calls that forced it to liquidate capital and open positions.*** Morningstar added, \u201c\u2018[t]his fund should never have been marketed to fund shareholders as a tool for capital preservation.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd when the market tanks? Well\u2026\n\n\u201cInvestors, analysts and the media were stunned that such a modest downturn of just 4% in a single day and roughly 2% over two days in the Dow and S&amp;P 500 could nearly wipe out the entire value of the Preservation Fund. The events were described by the media and analysts as \u201cjaw-droppingly awful,\u201d a \u201ccollapse,\u201d a \u201cdebacle,\u201d the \u201cbiggest one-week drop for a mutual fund recorded in 20 years,\u201d and perhaps \u201c\u2018the biggest two-day drop for a mutual fund ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case arises from one of the most rapid mutual fund collapses in history wherein the Preservation Fund lost 80% of its value in just two days. LJM Partners, Ltd. (\u201cLJM Partners\u201d), an affiliate of LJM and the Fund, was an investment advisor that managed hedge funds. LJM Partners marketed some of its funds as aggressive strategy funds, such as the \u201cModerately Aggressive Strategy\u201d and the \u201cAggressive Strategy.\u201d But this case involves the collapse of its affiliated, and purportedly conservative, Preservation Fund, created in 2012. As its name suggests, the Preservation Fund was marketed to investors seeking lower risk and moderate growth through a \nmore conservative strategy that would preserve capital and avoid the massive risks of aggressive hedge funds seeking greater returns.\u201d\n\nhttps://ljmfundssecuritiessettlement.com/Content/Documents/Complaint.pdf\n\nPlease, for the love of Harambe\u2026. Get these docs to the attention of the wrinkle brains. It literally details the entire ETF/mutual fund scam and how it\u2019s pretty much centered around an options scam. \n\nTreasure trove of docs for wrinkles to review: https://www.ljmfundssecuritiessettlement.com/Home/Documents\n\nEdit: added details\n\nEdit 2: another fund was also sued the following year (but for the same timeframe) for the same outcome of their investment so I\u2019m including the coverage of this as well https://citywireusa.com/professional-buyer/news/investors-sue-etf-shop-over-losses-from-volmageddon/a1196427\n\nEdit 3: day was referred to as \u201cVolmageddon\u201d. https://www.etftrends.com/etf-strategist-channel/volmageddon-tale-two-volatilities/\n\nThanks for the awards, but please save them for someone worthy.\n\nI\u2019m done adding/editing because I huff crayons.
