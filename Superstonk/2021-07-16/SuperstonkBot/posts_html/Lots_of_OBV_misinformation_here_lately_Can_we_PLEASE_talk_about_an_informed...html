<p>Yo, apes, we need to talk. My future wife's boyfriend is getting upset. TLDR at bottom (and graph just above that), but I really hope you do read this post and try to get a bit more informed about OBV.</p>
<p>I just wanted to create a post about OBV. To preface, I am by NO means a stock market guru, but I do believe indicators have their place only as long as they are interpreted properly. I've been seeing a lot of posts lately about OBV and how nobody it shows nobody is selling, etc. Although well-intentioned, many of these posts are spreading misinformation, and I'd like to provide (sorry) some counter-information. Note that this is not counter-DD, because, well, it still supports that apes strong together.</p>
<p>Let's take a step back and start with the basics of OBV:</p>
<p><strong>What is OBV? (</strong><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp"><strong>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp</strong></a><strong>)</strong><br />
"On-Balance Volume is a technical indicator of momentum, using volume changes to make price predictions."<br />
To put it simply, it is a <strong>cumulative function</strong> that goes up by the volume when the <strong>candle is green</strong>, and down by the volume when the <strong>candle is red</strong>. Let's talk about two import parts of this phrase:</p>
<p>1) Since OBV is a <strong>cumulative function</strong>, its value is going to depend on where it starts accumulating. I like examples, so let me share a couple:</p>
<p>Pretend we did 10 volume today, and we closed higher than we opened. The OBV, if we start from this morning, is +10.</p>
<p>Pretend we also did 5 volume yesterday, and we closed lower than we opened. The current OBV, if we start from yesterday morning, is -5 + 10 = +5.</p>
<p>That's two different values just based on when we chose our starting point.</p>
<p>A lot of the OBV posts are showing how nobody sold from the January run-up. Yes, we have diamond hands, but keep in mind the knowledge we have now simply was not as widespread back in January. I want to jack tits, believe me, but a misinformed interpretation of OBV isn't going to help us out. Justifying the current OBV from a starting point in January is going to be prone to error -- major events (such as the January run-up) can significantly throw off OBV. Directly from investopedia: "<em>Another note of caution in using the OBV is that a large spike in volume on a single day can throw off the indicator for quite a while. For instance, a surprise earnings announcement, being added or removed from an index, or massive institutional block trades can cause the indicator to spike or plummet, but the spike in volume may not be indicative of a trend.</em>"</p>
<p>Further, I've seen some discussion/DD where comparisons were made in terms of percentage change, i.e. between stock price % change and OBV % change. If you include the January spike, OBV is sky-high. Once OBV goes sky-high, any remaining % changes will be negligible because the denominator will be extremely large. For example, a change of +10 for OBV when the old OBV value was +5 would be calculated as (New-Old)/Old, or (15-5)/5 = +200% (Note that new = 10+5, old is 5). But if we had a change of 10 when the old OBV value was 10,000, (New-Old)/Old would be (10,010-10,000)/(10,000), or 10/10,000 -- which is hardly anything. So again, doing such a comparison is doing a disservice to our collective knowledge.</p>
<p>2) Let's also talk about green candles and red candles to explain OBV. A lot of people seem confused about what a green candle and a red candle means - it does not mean there was more buying pressure or there was more selling pressure. A candle is literally like those box-and-whisker plots we did back in school that have two stems and a bar area. The tips of the stems are the low and high for a period, and the bars are the opening and closing price for that period. If you are looking at each candle being 4 hours, or 1 day, each bar will represent the information for that 4-hour period, or that one day. <strong>The color is only indicative of whether or not we closed higher or lower than we opened for that period. It tells us nothing about buying and selling pressure.</strong> I have seen a lot of people mention that "there were a lot of sells during that period" or "there was a lot of buying in that period."</p>
<p>Let's be clear: 1 sell = 1 buy. Candle colors do not tell us about buying or selling pressure. It is just close-vs-open value.</p>
<p>Now, with the above two points out of the way, let's talk about the OBV and where it is today. If the OBV is prone to error by large volume spikes (e.g. January), it would be better to consider OBV from a subsequent time period. I would argue that any time during the February dip would be an excellent starting point. We didn't have any hugely significant spikes since then that would completely bias our OBV. By using February as a starting point, we are also approaching the OBV indicator much more conservatively -- that is, <strong>we are assuming that there were no diamond hands from the January run-up.</strong> This is a huge assumption (and we know it isn't true), but we ought to appropriately and informatively jack our tits.</p>
<p>Below, I've mapped the OBV over time from the February doldrums to present day. I normalized the OBV so the low value coincides with the lowest point in the stock price, and the high of the OBV is tied to the highest price.</p>

<p>Guys, there was some selling off back in March, and we can see the OBV line does trend with the stock price at the time. But how much of this is from SHFs vs retail, I won't pretend I can interpret. But fear not...</p>
<p>Let's look at where we are today. <strong>Again, ignoring all diamond-hands from January, which only furthers our rocket ????????????</strong>, our OBV value today is <strong>consistently</strong> around our first peak to 350 in March. Do you see the continuous increase in OBV from the end of March through the first week of June, and the continued support since then? <strong>We are sitting at the same OBV as the $350 spike in March, but we have a stock price of only $187. Additionally, consider that we do have a positive OBV impact since January, and besides the gain in OBV we've had since February, there has been an absolute gain in OBV between December and February (not charted), and you'll see our pressure on the stock is through the roof.</strong> The coil gets wound harder and harder and the clock keeps ticking. <em>This jacks the tits.</em></p>
<p><strong>TDLR:</strong> As you can see, even with a conservative approach that tries to remove the January bias, OBV indicates bullish sentiment on the stock. Keep in mind that OBV still includes all of the garbage wash sales and sales of rehypothecated shares that SHFs have been throwing into the market, yet we are still coming on top.</p>
<p>As a side note, we also have other excellent DD covering other bases and aspects that shows Hedgies R Fuk. It's important to not just rely on one indicator, but rather a combination of indicators, to better understand the bigger picture of what is happening, and it's beautiful when the interpretations of the various indicators converge. (FYI, I do think that Fidelity's hugely tilted buy/sell ratio is another indicator we can use to show retail sentiment backs up the above OBV analysis.)</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, be zen, hope this helps apes stay informed, and see you on the moon. ????????????</p>
