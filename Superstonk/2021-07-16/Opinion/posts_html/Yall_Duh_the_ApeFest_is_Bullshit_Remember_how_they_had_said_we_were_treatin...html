<p>Woke up to ApeFest being shilled out like a mother effer. </p>
<p>Seems like there are a lot of distractions these days, but I'm sure most of yall are smart enough to know that this is one. Right? Please tell me yall didn't throw money at this. </p>

<p>We know Kenny and other dingus SHFs ^((I mean both "S" for shitty and short).)  love a double entendre.  Holy hell guys the MSM has been blasting people who are invested in GME as well as those on Reddit who are invested in GME as well as other stocks as treating the markets like a <strong>casino.</strong> </p>

<p>Don't you find it damn ironic that this is being held at......a casino?</p>
<p>I personally would rather meet other shareholders at a shareholder meeting in the future as I'm sure other investors would. </p>

<p><strong>From a behavior perspective</strong> they are utilizing stimulus pairing. Basically they see Ape/Reddit/GME investor they see CASINO. Total spec here but: this is likely aimed toward psychologically creating a stimulus class in which people invested in GME are equated to those creating a casino out of the markets. Stimulus classes create the same effect on the environment. </p>

<p>I'm sure you haven't signed up because you're a good boi and smarter than that, but shit just don't because it will add to anything they're trying to stir up...possibly from even a legal standpoint. Honestly there's not a better way to do that than to use concepts rooted in behaviorism to make certain stimulus pairings reinforcing to the public and themselves.</p>
