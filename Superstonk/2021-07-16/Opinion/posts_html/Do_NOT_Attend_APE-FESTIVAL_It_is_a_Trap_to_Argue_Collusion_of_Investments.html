<p><em>Update: Edit 2: Apparently an “organizer” of the Ape Festival reached out to me. See my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olpd6e/apefestival_organizer_contacted_me_regarding_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">most recent post </a> for my response. Cheers.</em></p>
<p>Multiple things wrong with this “festival”</p>
<p>1) Seems like Fyre festival 2.0. Massive scam all over again</p>
<p>2) this can be used as an argument that a collective group of investors got together to form a collaborative investment scheme… aka market manipulation </p>
<p>3) it’s a trap to get you to waste thousands of dollars… go buy and hold instead. </p>
<p><em>this is not financial advice. I’m dumb as fuck</em></p>
<p>Edit: Wow thanks for the awards kind friends, but no need, just trying to spread awareness!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Apparently an “organizer” of the Ape Festival reached out to me. See my most recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olpd6e/apefestival_organizer_contacted_me_regarding_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">post</a> for my response. Cheers.</p>
<p>Edit3: Mods - this organizer is a member of the sub and has been commenting as of today. I’m nobody to enforce rules but it would be prudent to ban them.</p>
<p>Edit 4: See edit 2. This Ape-Fest Organizer reported me for alleged “self harm.” Sorry for all the posts but I made a stand alone post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olrytf/update_to_my_fuck_you_apefestival_post_they/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a> to declare I am perfectly safe and in no harm whatsoever. This was a malicious report.</p>
