See my [most recent post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olpd6e/apefestival_organizer_contacted_me_regarding_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for my response. Cheers.*\n\n\nMultiple things wrong with this \u201cfestival\u201d\n\n1) Seems like Fyre festival 2.0. Massive scam all over again\n\n2) this can be used as an argument that a collective group of investors got together to form a collaborative investment scheme\u2026 aka market manipulation \n\n3) it\u2019s a trap to get you to waste thousands of dollars\u2026 go buy and hold instead. \n\n*this is not financial advice. I\u2019m dumb as fuck*\n\nEdit: Wow thanks for the awards kind friends, but no need, just trying to spread awareness!\n \nEdit 2: Apparently an \u201corganizer\u201d of the Ape Festival reached out to me. See my most recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olpd6e/apefestival_organizer_contacted_me_regarding_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for my response. Cheers.\n\nEdit3: Mods - this organizer is a member of the sub and has been commenting as of today. I\u2019m nobody to enforce rules but it would be prudent to ban them.\n\nEdit 4: See edit 2. This Ape-Fest Organizer reported me for alleged \u201cself harm.\u201d Sorry for all the posts but I made a stand alone post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olrytf/update_to_my_fuck_you_apefestival_post_they/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to declare I am perfectly safe and in no harm whatsoever. This was a malicious report.",
