Here is the post.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20210716144742/https://www.reddit.com/r/SNDL/comments/mmub30/sndl\\_why\\_its\\_in\\_my\\_portfolio\\_and\\_why\\_the\\_company/?utm\\_name=iossmf](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716144742/https://www.reddit.com/r/SNDL/comments/mmub30/sndl_why_its_in_my_portfolio_and_why_the_company/?utm_name=iossmf)\n\nIt is important to note that this mod has had access to Satori and its code since Mid May. It is no longer drama and it will directly affect any FUD campaign and the overall direction of this sub. Imagine the \"news\" we read is filtered and guided just as the MSM. Imagine the posts and those who are in positions of authority in our community guide us to beliefs that MOASS is not what it's meant to be, that our opponent is not what it's meant to be.\n\nThe point of this is to bring awareness and to remember that buy and hodl are the resounding prominence of this sub. No idols, no mod worship, no ape worship. I LIKE THE STOCK. I am most likely going to get downvoted or reported as suicidal and this post will get taken down. I AM NOT SUICIDAL AND I DO NOT WISH TO HARM MYSELF OR OTHERS.\n\nEDIT 9: PINK HAS BEEN BANNED PERM FROM SUPERSTONK\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/32wmhdrsomb71.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=b46d81571c4ff0ac2e36f9a2395b3619de5d29be\n\nEDIT 8: In line with keeping things factual there is a reply from Satori team member below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flf4t15dkmb71.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f6fb38095a7e5f6251bdce83caa8e3d621b95be\n\nEDIT 7: Castle of Glass DD author /u/3for100specials had a very hard time getting his DD up and is blowing his whistle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Unbelievable- this is in reply to Rensoles pin in edit 4](https://preview.redd.it/rqduy1heimb71.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccbf37a43806f145371cf7dae4db1aa50af78792)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 6:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n56xz2boemb71.jpg?width=935&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61c08e203ece3c1db31962fe2dc7d5c60ec1da61\n\nEDIT 5: Mods are now combing through this post. It will be forever saved here : [https://web.archive.org/web/20210716184523/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olimp5/important\\_and\\_needs\\_to\\_be\\_seen/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210716184523/https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/olimp5/important_and_needs_to_be_seen/)\n\nEDIT 4: It is speculated that this mod has had Satori access in the discord for developing Satori \"Shill Net\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22zd9d4xdmb71.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c05bad9d3ae93a465eceb7e519d9cb31903a2f8\n\nEDIT 3: Decide for yourself - March 20th after the first sneeze. Could be a slight against people left holding after the \"inital squeeze?\" COULD BE. Nothing is certain. Use your own discretion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwxoiy7o3mb71.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=c81a807d70e3477d057f1a3b8ede3f5f36738bd5\n\nEDIT 2: Further concerning threads\n\nWasn\u2019t this the same person who received mod privileges and news immediately came out that she said GME was just a pump and dump? There was a screenshot of the convo in which she said this, but it has since been removed. Looks like this was given \u201cdebunked\u201d flair by the mods and post is deleted. I\u2019m confused. There was a screenshot of her saying this so what is there to debunk?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/obsdfz/new\\_mod\\_madie\\_thinks\\_gme\\_is\\_a\\_pump\\_and\\_dump\\_would/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/obsdfz/new_mod_madie_thinks_gme_is_a_pump_and_dump_would/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nEDIT: Made a reply below about why this is important:\n\n\"You are zen and I admire that, I am too but you had to go through a lot to get there, I assume? It's not like you showed up and instantly knew everything about the GME situation (if you did I'm jealous). Think of the new apes, think outside of yourself. I know you're speaking on behalf of yourself but imagine the crowd JUST getting in now as they start to see LinkedIN news and MSM lying their asses off. Do you want them to find THIS superstonk or the superstonk that fostered this growth in the first place?\"",
