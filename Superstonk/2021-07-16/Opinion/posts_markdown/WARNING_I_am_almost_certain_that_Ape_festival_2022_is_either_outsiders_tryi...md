#Title: WARNING. I am almost certain that ‘Ape festival 2022’ is either outsiders trying to cash in on the movement, or a desperate ploy from SHF to make a case of a ‘group’ of retail investors manipulating the market. Be wary.

I don’t even feel like this needs to be said as I feel like 99% of us are all on the same page on this one, but recently a website and twitter handle has been plugging an ‘Ape Festival 2022’ in Vegas backed by some big names involved in GME or another certain movie stocks on twitter.

This is either some Fyre Festival 2.0 shit or in my opinion, potentially something more sinister by SHF to try and create a narrative of retail manipulation. WE ARE NOT A COLLECTIVE GROUP OR ORGANIZATION, WE ARE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS THAT JUST LIKE THE STOCK.

I am not going to name said people who look to also be promoting the event as I have no proof that they are involved or receiving any type of compensation outside them being tagged, retweeting and promoting said event, but its worth pointing out seeing as they have a collective following of around 500k\~ followers.

As I said, at best its in my opinion a blatant cash grab and possibly even a scam, at worst a potential move by SHF to establish a narrative that we are a collective group of investors manipulating the market.

The DD is done. Don’t give these guys any of your money.

Edit: Glad to see u/rensole covered it in The Daily Stonk going into much more detail than myself so check that out. Seemed to be well on top of it before me. Try to avoid going to the actual website and giving them clicks :)
