# Title: Just a friendly reminder, that the top mods made the call to bring satori in, the top mods made it possible to have this sub relatively shill free. The top mods specifically made a hierarchy so the sub cant be taken over without serious effort. I trust the mods to clean up this mess and move on.

Shills can take their concern trolling elsewhere. There is no rush or urgency to go for kneejerk reactions. Even if this sub is full of useless memes and forum sliding for 3 days straight, there is nothing going on other than buying and holding anyways. So all those "this is a serious sub and we need to deal with this IMmEdIaTely" people can just dial it down a notch and relax.

I trust u/rensole and u/redchessqueen99 and the other mods to clean up this mess, just like they did with all the other messes that got cleaned up. Give these guys time they are just human, they specifically have hierarchies and protocols in place for such situations. Also the sudden anti top mod sentiment screams FUD campaign to me, but that's just me. Suddenly its a problem that rensole is doing the daily news? Or that red is taking a break from moderating the sub after the recent fallout? People pressuring for a urgent resolution need to understand that there is no rush, there is nothing noteworthy going on beside speculation and investigating, which is done in the background anyway. We know the DD, we know the outcome. Just downvote the aging Kenny faces and ape fest memes and move on. We are going to be fine. Remember under which direction we got the sub we like in the first place. News are getting out, people are starting to realize GME is a bomb ready to explode. And all the bad actors in this whole ordeal will be revealed over time, so just lower your pitchforks and wait for a stable resolution. Remember shills are trying everything to bring this sub down and this far there was a reason they were not able to, because there are only two people here who have the power to do so.

I for one trust the mods to find a solution in due time. Ill just go and touch some grass and breath fresh air, because I didn't see sunlight for like 4 days (this is not true I take a 30 min walk every morning because it has really good health benefits and provides stable energy levels throughout the day, but I wanted to end this with a witty comment so here we are)

and remember there is nothing to do, nothing is urgent, nothing needs an "immediate" solution. One low level shill mod cant drive this sub into ruins, because they have mod log to check SUS behavior and if push comes to shove mod log can always be provided to clear up the situation.

BUY AND HOLD

EDIT: Well this turned out to be polarizing, but nothing I didn't expect. Want to address some comments here so I don't spread myself thin.

If the sub is truly compromised like some suggest, we will see evidence of that in the coming weeks. All the comments about red and rensole being compromised and therefore need to be replaced do not make sense. They were essential in building up this sub and providing a breeding ground for discussion and investigation. And we had some bombshells that dropped right in this sub. All I need from RCQ and rensole is to be committed to this cause, in their freetime they can love, believe in and act the way they want. If RCQ brought in a mod based on romantic feelings, than this is a learning lesson for her. Shills tried to take this sub down for months and they didn't succeed, take your time and think why that would be? Maybe because there are only two people, really capable of doing it, which are??? rensole and RCQ. They must be under extreme pressure and target of fucking insane psy ops tactics (like maybe using romantic feelings) to undermine them. I'm not buying a sudden sentiment meant to replace them. Its highly SUS and if they slipped up, than that's a learning opportunity not a reason to oust them. I trust in their conviction to have this sub be the best version it can be. Also remember that there are some 5Head people in the mod team. I'm sure they know how to deal with that shit. So there is NO RUSH for a decision. This doesn't need to be resolved immediately. There is nothing urgent.

Also we still haven't heard from the Satori team about the access that is granted to the code. And even if she got access, there is always a way to rollback and start again.

EDIT2: Shills are really turning up the HEAT. I'm almost certain this is a dedicated takeover attempt, that was in the works for quite some time, maybe some specific high profile sleeper shill became active? hmm.

Ill probably stop replying now, I cant take the non sequiturs and red herrings anymore.
