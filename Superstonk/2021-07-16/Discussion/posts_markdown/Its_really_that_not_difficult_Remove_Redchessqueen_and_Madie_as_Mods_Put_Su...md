#Title: It’s really that not difficult. Remove Redchessqueen and Madie as Mods. Put Superstonk on private for the weekend. Figure out who will be replacing these mods and once completed, everything is back to normal and we get ready for Monday.

Seriously, this isn’t that difficult. Remove the mods. Vote on the new mods. Or you can have the sub vote on the mods. Maybe even allow pinkcatsonacid back as a mod. 

Make this sub private for this weekend and let’s figure this shit out. Don’t ruin this sub based on ego and stupidity. We have half a million people here, professionals for the industry, all the great AMAs, don’t ruin this sub. MSM will eat this shit up as well. Be smart!

This is a simple solution to save this subreddit. Or else Superstonk is done.

If nothing is done, I’ll be going to the jungle
