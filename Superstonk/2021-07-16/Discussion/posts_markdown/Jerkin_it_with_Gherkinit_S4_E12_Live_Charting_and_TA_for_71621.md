Good Morning Superstonk,

First thing I want to make perfectly clear, I am in no way involved with any sort of ape meet-up event while I love all you fucking degenerates, I'm here to get rich and fuk hedgies. I leave that kind of bullshit for the popcorn jockey's. Now where are my crayons?

After all the fuckery we need to close this week with a nice W on the scoreboard for Apes. It looks like we had a great bounce of that low at $151 in yesterday's pre-market currently up $21. I expect this uptrend to continue into next week but with the current Gamma Ramp set-up we may see some bullish action today.

Volume dried right up for lunch time sideways chop before the next test. The bull is spent from all the mayo getting milked out of it. He should rally soon.

400k ITM puts purchased at opening bell. SPY also came down a bit. Lets see if we get a bounce off VWAP into a test of 180.

# Pre-Market Analysis

Seem to have continued that ascending channel from yesterday through pre-market volume currently at about 30k but it should pick up towards open. 115k shares borrowed so we may see a small dip if we have a low volume open.  However, If volume picks up we are well on the way to an opening test of 180.

ADX is no trending up from the dip and DI has shifted to + so we are definitely at the beginning of a strong uptrend

BBKC Broke out if we see significant upwards action today we could return to the technical trends we were looking at coming into this week

Options information this week with so far. Also significant put volume on every GME carrying ETF to the tune of about $0.6B.

We touched the first signal line on CV\_VWAP yesterday due to a pretty hot European open. I will continue to monitor this for larger signals of arbitrage.
