Maybe even allow pinkcatsonacid back as a mod. \n\nMake this sub private for this weekend and let\u2019s figure this shit out. Don\u2019t ruin this sub based on ego and stupidity. We have half a million people here, professionals for the industry, all the great AMAs, don\u2019t ruin this sub. MSM will eat this shit up as well. Be smart!\n\nThis is a simple solution to save this subreddit. Or else Superstonk is done.\n\nIf nothing is done, I\u2019ll be going to the jungle",
