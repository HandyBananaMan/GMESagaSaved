Edit2: The aggressive and unnecessary comments are only confirming sliding... as well as more personification and old ken memes showing up still. I rest my case.\n\n**STOP POSTING THE SAME MEMES**\n\nYou are flooding the sub with the exact same \"old man ken reaction\" images.\n\nNo effort. No creativity. No differences between yours and the previous 20 that are flooding the sub.\n\nI shouldn't wake up to **FIVE** of the same fucking images with crappy titles on \"HOT\" with tons of upvotes. I can let tweets from RC or DFV slide (self explanatory), but these no effort reposts for karma are getting out of hand (and not that funny tbh)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry I didn't want to be the bad guy, but this needed to be addressed.\n\nBack to your regularly scheduled Fuckery Friday in the casino. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80",
