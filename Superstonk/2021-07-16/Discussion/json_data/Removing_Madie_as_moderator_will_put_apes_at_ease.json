    "selftext": "\nCan the Mods Make an argument with why she\u2019s essential to the sub or remove her. Keeping her without some kind of statement to the sub other then \u201cwe voted her in\u201d seems like a majority of the mods could be compromised. \n\nMost of us like Pink\u2026.\n\nAnyway REGARDLESS Buy, Hodl, buckleup![\n\nEdit 1: I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll get an answer from our Mod team. Something I\u2019ve observed is that  POWER CORRUPTS. Few get a hold of it and willingly let it go, rather they want more and more. I don\u2019t get a good feeling from the way this has been handled. Pink unanimously getting silenced honestly is a bad look. Other mods are keeping silent in fear of also getting the axe? If all it takes to compromise Red is some nudes then Kenny G is going to have an easy time spreading FUD when he really needs to. I\u2019m for free speech on this sub as long as it\u2019s not spreading FUD which she wasn\u2019t.  I personally want to hear what she has to say and if you do as well she can be found running https://www.reddit.com/r/GMEJungle/ \nI\u2019d like to see trust in the mod team restored and another large migration prevented. We have a lot of good stuff here on R/Superstonks.\nI\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of house selling stuff today and haven\u2019t had a chance to respond to everyone. Just got under contract so hopefully will be dumping 30k+ into some more of the one true play. Can\u2019t stop, won\u2019t stop, GameStop.\n\nEdit 2: is their a downvote tracker I can add to this? I\u2019m surprised at the amount of people on this Sub in favor of a shill Mod.",
