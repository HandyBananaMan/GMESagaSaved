    "selftext": "Good Morning Superstonk,\n\nFirst thing I want to make perfectly clear, I am in no way involved with any sort of ape meet-up event while I love all you fucking degenerates, I'm here to get rich and fuk hedgies. I leave that kind of bullshit for the popcorn jockey's. Now where are my crayons?\n\nAfter all the fuckery we need to close this week with a nice W on the scoreboard for Apes. It looks like we had a great bounce of that low at $151 in yesterday's pre-market currently up $21. I expect this uptrend to continue into next week but with the current Gamma Ramp set-up we may see some bullish action today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n38rc9qpikb71.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d8eae42c509e7d8cf654572520a069999127d03\n\nIf you guys haven't had a chance to [Check out this weeks forward looking TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/oi6c88/jerkin_it_with_gherkinit_forward_looking_ta_for/)\n\nJoin us in the Daily Livestream [https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial](https://www.youtube.com/c/PickleFinancial)\n\nOr listen along with our live audio feed on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HbqnUVsSrH)\n\n(save these links in case reddit goes down)\n\n*(this post will read from top to bottom)*\n\n(*feel free to ask me questions below, but if you can google it yourself please use common sense)*\n\nHistorical Resistance/Support:\n\n116.5, 125.5, 132.5, 141, 145, 147.5, 150, 152.5, **157 (previous ATM offering)**, 158.5, 162.5, 163, 165.5, 172, 174, 176.5, 179, 180.5, 182, 183.5, 184.5, 186, 187.5, 190.5, 192, 195, 196.5, 197.5, 200, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, **225.20 (new ATM offering)** 226, 232.5, 235, 242.5, 250, 255, 262.5, 275, 280, 285, 300, 302.50, 310, 317.50, 325, 332.5, 340, 350, 400, 483, moon base...\n\nEdit 5 1:49\n\nVolume dried right up for lunch time sideways chop before the next test.

SPY also came down a bit. Lets see if we get a bounce off VWAP into a test of 180.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oaje2rtrxkb71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4c522b4b82b0a81f0ced82ae7db54cfc00145b9\n\n# Pre-Market Analysis\n\nSeem to have continued that ascending channel from yesterday through pre-market volume currently at about 30k but it should pick up towards open. 115k shares borrowed so we may see a small dip if we have a low volume open.  However, If volume picks up we are well on the way to an opening test of 180.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4xmnwc8jkb71.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7468fc02ec2272307d42d0a258be19ebb18e19d\n\nADX is no trending up from the dip and DI has shifted to + so we are definitely at the beginning of a strong uptrend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nfx0u9sjkb71.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab3a9b5ca530d0544a4b0fd1047e4c273786a08a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBBKC Broke out if we see significant upwards action today we could return to the technical trends we were looking at coming into this week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhrtgywikkb71.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=58b693b787afb6eab4c81d1a6c762dffef32096e\n\nOptions information this week with so far. Also significant put volume on every GME carrying ETF to the tune of about $0.6B.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xxytth6lkb71.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71bf8d7b24296db297da71169acfb5d8504d3d7\n\nWe touched the first signal line on CV\\_VWAP yesterday due to a pretty hot European open. I will continue to monitor this for larger signals of arbitrage.\n\nDisclaimer\n\n*\\* Although my profession is day trading, I in no way endorse day-trading of GME not only does it present significant risk, it can delay the squeeze.*\n\n*\\*My YouTube channel is \"monetized\" if that is something you are uncomfortable with, I understand, while I wouldn't say I profit greatly from the views, I do suggest you use ad-block when viewing it if you feel so compelled.* *My intention is simply benefit this community.
