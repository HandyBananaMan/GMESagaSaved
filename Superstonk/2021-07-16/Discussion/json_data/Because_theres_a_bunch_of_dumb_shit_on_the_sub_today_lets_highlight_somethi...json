The focus is on the Fed policy of QE and lending since 2008 and whether it was good or bad. It\u2019s overwhelmingly seen as bad but, interestingly enough, both arguments agree that the end result is that we\u2019re currently fucked. \n\nIt references GME (DFV shoutouts) but doesn\u2019t necessarily say that it\u2019s good or bad, it simply states that our markets are dangerously susceptible. It confirms that borrowers are over leveraged and all the money is just funneling to investments of the top 1% and provides significant risk because Wall Street is essentially black mailing the economy. Do what they want or they\u2019ll freak out and crash the economy\u2026 so that\u2019s exactly what the Fed does.\n\nMultiple billionaires, Nobel Prize economist, ex Fed,SEC, Finance heads, etc. are interviewed and they all agree with the macro trends we\u2019ve been discussing here. The bias confirmation is delicious. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s intentional or shills or FUD or whatever, and I don\u2019t really care, but there\u2019s a common thread in the sub that folks feel ostracized from talking about GME in real life. I know that\u2019s the case for me, and people who don\u2019t understand the stock market or economic policy can\u2019t grasp what I\u2019m trying to say so it\u2019s difficult to make a coherent argument. I think that\u2019s pretty natural, we\u2019re talking about many enormous threads in this sub and it\u2019s next to impossible to tie together if you aren\u2019t following closely. We don\u2019t have the benefit of traditionally reliable sources to give to friends and fam because financial media is a Wall Street talk piece and multi page story\u2019s on policy aren\u2019t going to get any clicks from reliable media. \n\nTHIS IS THE EPISODE TO SHOW YOUR FRIENDS/FAMILY TO VALIDATE WHAT WE\u2019VE BEEN SAYING. I don\u2019t want to hear MSM blah about Frontline, it\u2019s as credible of a source as there is and they tell this story fairly. I\u2019ve talked to my wife about the economy as I\u2019ve positioned our investments but she doesn\u2019t care enough to know all the detail of it, she trusts me. I had her watch this episode just so she could understand and it clicked for her. \n\nThere\u2019s power in this episode well beyond Superstonk that can help our friends and family educate themselves on a possibility most of us believe is inevitable. It brings nothing but credibility to our argument and further Jack\u2019s my tits that GME is a black swan event driven by free money and risk aversion leading SHF\u2019s to dig a gargantuan hole that they can\u2019t get out of. They\u2019re so fuk\u2019d.\n\nEdit: fixed link, words.",
