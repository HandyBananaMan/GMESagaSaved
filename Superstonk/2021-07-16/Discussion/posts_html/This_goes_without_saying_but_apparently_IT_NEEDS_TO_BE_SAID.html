<p>Edit: Seems it could be intentional sliding. As of now, more are showing up with plenty of upvotes. Either way, Buy/Hodl is the remedy. Edit2: The aggressive and unnecessary comments are only confirming sliding... as well as more personification and old ken memes showing up still. I rest my case.</p>
<p><strong>STOP POSTING THE SAME MEMES</strong></p>
<p>You are flooding the sub with the exact same "old man ken reaction" images.</p>
<p>No effort. No creativity. No differences between yours and the previous 20 that are flooding the sub.</p>
<p>I shouldn't wake up to <strong>FIVE</strong> of the same fucking images with crappy titles on "HOT" with tons of upvotes. I can let tweets from RC or DFV slide (self explanatory), but these no effort reposts for karma are getting out of hand (and not that funny tbh)</p>

<p>Sorry I didn't want to be the bad guy, but this needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>Back to your regularly scheduled Fuckery Friday in the casino. ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸš€</p>
