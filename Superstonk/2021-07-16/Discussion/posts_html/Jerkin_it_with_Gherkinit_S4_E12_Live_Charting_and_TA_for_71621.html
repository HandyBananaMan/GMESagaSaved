<p>Good Morning Superstonk,</p>
<p>First thing I want to make perfectly clear, I am in no way involved with any sort of ape meet-up event while I love all you fucking degenerates, I'm here to get rich and fuk hedgies. I leave that kind of bullshit for the popcorn jockey's. Now where are my crayons?</p>
<p>After all the fuckery we need to close this week with a nice W on the scoreboard for Apes. It looks like we had a great bounce of that low at $151 in yesterday's pre-market currently up $21. I expect this uptrend to continue into next week but with the current Gamma Ramp set-up we may see some bullish action today.</p>

<p>Volume dried right up for lunch time sideways chop before the next test. The bull is spent from all the mayo getting milked out of it. He should rally soon. </p>

<p>Edit 1 9:49</p>
<p>400k ITM puts purchased at opening bell. SPY also came down a bit. Lets see if we get a bounce off VWAP into a test of 180.</p>

<h1>Pre-Market Analysis</h1>
<p>Seem to have continued that ascending channel from yesterday through pre-market volume currently at about 30k but it should pick up towards open. 115k shares borrowed so we may see a small dip if we have a low volume open.  However, If volume picks up we are well on the way to an opening test of 180.</p>

<p>ADX is no trending up from the dip and DI has shifted to + so we are definitely at the beginning of a strong uptrend</p>

<p>BBKC Broke out if we see significant upwards action today we could return to the technical trends we were looking at coming into this week</p>

<p>Options information this week with so far. Also significant put volume on every GME carrying ETF to the tune of about $0.6B.</p>

<p>We touched the first signal line on CV_VWAP yesterday due to a pretty hot European open. I will continue to monitor this for larger signals of arbitrage.</p>
