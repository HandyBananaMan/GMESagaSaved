<p>I must admit sometimes I be sad thinking how could I get such insights and knowledge after MOASS. You apes taught me so much during these months. More than years following greed, stupid, liars fintwit boomers.</p>
<p>Part of my tendies will be spent in deep financial education, in view of, in the future, sharing these with poorer people to, once again, transfer wealth from market thieves.</p>
<p>I love you (Gamestop)! My favorite videogame is Wii Sports. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€</p>
