# Title: This is human effort at its prime. A bunch of apes devoting its time, without vanity, to share a hell of knowledge others would charge $$$ (and lie in the middle). THANK YOU SO MUCH. Sometimes I be sad thinking how get such DDs after the MOASS

I must admit sometimes I be sad thinking how could I get such insights and knowledge after MOASS. You apes taught me so much during these months. More than years following greed, stupid, liars fintwit boomers.

Part of my tendies will be spent in deep financial education, in view of, in the future, sharing these with poorer people to, once again, transfer wealth from market thieves.

I love you (Gamestop)! My favorite videogame is Wii Sports. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
