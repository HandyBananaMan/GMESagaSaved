    "selftext": "I've been holding for a while now at $367, I don't remember the last time I saw green. I use to shout for help, but I have lost my voice.  Have you all forgotten me?  I'm holding and holding, but it's getting colder every day. The news is saying its a losing battle, its been nothing but dips.  Why do the lil guys always lose in the end? Please don't let them win this time. I said I would hold until the end, and I will, I'm just afraid I might die here alone :(\n\nEdit: I'm 21, and work part time in a shop. I'm on a minus in my bank account, I've sold all my other positions and have put everything I managed to scrape together the last 2 years, into GME. I wish I could buy more, but I don't have anything else.",
