    "selftext": "There are so many posts about the missing 1M volume that I am becoming suspicious that it is being used to distract from some amazing info we received yesterday. If you want to really get your tits jacked, go read [the new DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5me5g/the_mother_of_all_wedges_an_endgame_dd_technical/)  from u/WardenElite or read some of [the testimonies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5ne55/huge_tomorrow_congressional_hearing_testimonies/) for tomorrow's congressional hearings.\n\nI know some apes don't like to hear it, but we need to use  [Occam's razor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) sometimes. The wild theories about the missing 1M shares confirming that Citadel has been margin called just make it seem like all the great information uncovered in this sub is just as speculative. \n\nThere is so much reason to be hyped right now. Let's make sure fellow apes see the best information to confirm our bias. There are too many damn negative 1M volume posts.\n\nTits jacked and ready to moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit #1:\n\nI forgot to add that the S&P upgraded GME's credit rating from B- to B yesterday \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit #2:\n\nLink to SEC hearing starting at 12:00 PM ET https://financialservices.house.gov/live/",
