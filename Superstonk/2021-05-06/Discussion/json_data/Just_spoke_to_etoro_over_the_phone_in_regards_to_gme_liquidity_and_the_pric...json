    "selftext": "So I just spoke to my account manager over the phone. I know people have spoken before but I wanted to get some confirmation on liquidity and price spikes.\n\nMy account manager said that as long as the market doesn\u2019t halt I should be able to sell.\nThey won\u2019t have liquidity problems as they are broker and work it various banks in the market.\nThis was stated by him. \nHe said that in regards to price spikes they have seen that with cryptos and it shouldn\u2019t be a problem closing positions and taking your money out. Like he said it will be business as usual.\n\nHe also said if there is a problem with the platform and I can\u2019t take the money out they will pay out a fair amount depending on the stock price but he  said it\u2019s case to case basis, and since they are regulated by FCA they have to compensate. \n\nHe also said that gme is bullish long term but also believes it will squeeze.\n\nJust thought I would share this convo I just had. \n\nRegardless we will hold!!!",
