<p><em>"Nasdaq and some other market operators record stock prices in a compact computer format that uses 32 bits, or ones and zeros. The biggest number possible is two to the 32nd power minus one, or 4,294,967,295. Stock prices are frequently stored using four decimal places, so the highest possible price is $429,496.7295," The Wall Street Journal explained."</em></p>

<p>Berkshire just crossed the digit limit and broke the exchange. It is currently not trading, and you can not even look the ticker up on some platforms. Others show an updated time of 12:29 or 12:39. The NASDAQ was supposed to run an update out on 5/17/21... so Berkshire might be stuck in limbo for up to 11 days unless a solution is found.</p>

<p>This let's us know that there is/was a software limit on prices that a stock can hit on an open exchange. They could have limited our price ceiling purely based on the coding used on the exchanges. There would have been nothing we could do about it...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Did Berkshire just force the exchanges to implement higher stock prices, right before GME is set to moon? Did Berkshire just raise our ceiling?...</p>

<p>Is this really a simulation?</p>
