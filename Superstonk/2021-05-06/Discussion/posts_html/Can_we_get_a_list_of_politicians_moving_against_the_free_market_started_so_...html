<p>Can we create a list of politicians who support illegal market activities and have a list of their donors under their names?  Seriously, some of those politicians sounded like total tools during the hearing today.  One of them even used a death to justify screwing retail.  He COMPLETELY missed the mark.  These people are honestly disgusting.  Many of you were bringing up their donor lists during the hearings.  We should support the guys and gals who are moving to end the abuse of power that the market makers and hedge funds have used for so long.  These corrupt politicians are aiding the rich elite to rob millions of retail investors and it needs to stop.  These people will only care once their power is under a real threat.  Not only would it spread awareness, it would be wonderful to have a list to come back to when it's time to vote.</p>
<p>These old shitheads litterally insulted our intelligence today.  I don't know about you guys but I'm fucking PISSED.  Today showed Citadel is literally buying politicians.  They are supposed to represent the 99 percent, not the bloody 1 percent.  Until Citadel dies, I will buy and HODL.  They need to be deleted out of existence for the benefit of all future generations.</p>

<p>Edit: For some of you saying "let's not bring politics into this."  How do you propose a MOASS happens if it costs Citadel nothing to reset FTDs and nothing to create naked shorts from thin air?  They are the ones fighting to buy time to avoid solvency just like they did in 2008.  The only body that can create regulations to stop this bullshit is the U.S. Government.  And isn't it a tad bit ironic the part about naked shorts got cut off from the hearing and they never brought it up again?  This is TWICE now.  Fool me once shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I guess horse racing is more important to our elected officials.  This is important.  The MOASS isn't going to magically happen if they have these unregulated firms controlling the market.  Please stop protecting these scumbags buying time for Citadel with the "no politics" banter.  It's hurting the chances of the MOASS more than helping it.</p>
<p>Edit 2: For the very few apes saying politics will cause a rift.  How?  Why would any ape support a politician against a fair market?  Its uniting us, not dividing us.  Need proof?  Sort by new.  All my apes hate politicians who support market manipulation.  So stop spewing your bullshit here.  We have the right to be angry after today.</p>
<p>Edit 3: if you have social media please show love to the politicians that had us in mind as well!</p>
