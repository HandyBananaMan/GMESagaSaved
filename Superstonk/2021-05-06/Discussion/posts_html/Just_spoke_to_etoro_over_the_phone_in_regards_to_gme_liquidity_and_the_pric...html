<p>So I just spoke to my account manager over the phone. I know people have spoken before but I wanted to get some confirmation on liquidity and price spikes.</p>
<p>My account manager said that as long as the market doesn’t halt I should be able to sell.
They won’t have liquidity problems as they are broker and work it various banks in the market.
This was stated by him. 
He said that in regards to price spikes they have seen that with cryptos and it shouldn’t be a problem closing positions and taking your money out. Like he said it will be business as usual.</p>
<p>He also said if there is a problem with the platform and I can’t take the money out they will pay out a fair amount depending on the stock price but he  said it’s case to case basis, and since they are regulated by FCA they have to compensate. </p>
<p>He also said that gme is bullish long term but also believes it will squeeze.</p>
<p>Just thought I would share this convo I just had. </p>
<p>Regardless we will hold!!!</p>
