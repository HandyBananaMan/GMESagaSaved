The fact they think this way shows that they are not at all in line with the reality of the regular person... They are owned and paid for by the elite in charge. \n\nCan\u2019t believe they tried to bring race into this, this isn\u2019t about race, this is about poor/regular people vs elite abusers of a system.\n\nTo me this just shows the US economy/market is bound for collapse just based on the stupidity and ignorance of those in charge. I think GME will trigger it\n\nI will hold for life now, I will hold so Xers get rich, I will hold to break the corruption, I will hold to change the rules, I will hold for the ones who lost entire careers in 08. And I will hold for the kid who killed himself over wrong information.",
