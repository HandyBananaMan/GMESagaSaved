    "selftext": "Way I see it, congress tried everything they could to avoid the dark pool and naked short.\n\nThis should not be because they are bought, I believe, nor because they are incompetence. Some are. But I think the bigger reason for this should be because they are afraid of the truth going out, and nuking the trust in the US's market.\n\nThe trust are long lost among the apes, and I know for sure a lot of apes will stay away from the US market after this. But apes are not the world, there are a lot of investors out there that are oblivious to the entire GME saga, who looked upon apes and saw we being the retards that we are.\n\nIf those people lose their trust in the market, that would be critical.\n\nCongress is afraid of this. And that is a freaking good news to me. Fear can be a good motivation, as it push people off their comfortable chair to do their damn job.",
