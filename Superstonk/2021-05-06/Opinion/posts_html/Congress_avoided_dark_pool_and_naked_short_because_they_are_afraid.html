<p>Way I see it, congress tried everything they could to avoid the dark pool and naked short.</p>
<p>This should not be because they are bought, I believe, nor because they are incompetence. Some are. But I think the bigger reason for this should be because they are afraid of the truth going out, and nuking the trust in the US's market.</p>
<p>The trust are long lost among the apes, and I know for sure a lot of apes will stay away from the US market after this. But apes are not the world, there are a lot of investors out there that are oblivious to the entire GME saga, who looked upon apes and saw we being the retards that we are.</p>
<p>If those people lose their trust in the market, that would be critical.</p>
<p>Congress is afraid of this. And that is a freaking good news to me. Fear can be a good motivation, as it push people off their comfortable chair to do their damn job.</p>
