<p>Quick update for my Apes:</p>
<p>No DEEP ITM Calls or Puts were purchased in large block trades today.</p>

<p>There's been a rather significant reduction in the frequency at which we are seeing these large block purchases.  Time will tell the true impact this is having on the FTD's. Keeping it short as there's not much to report on this front. u/Dan_Bren out  ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ ðŸš€</p>
