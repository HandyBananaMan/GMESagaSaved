<p>Did I mention I'm actually frickin <strong>STOKED</strong> about this hearing?! Like, I didn't have very high hopes about it until the witness statements came out and I got to read <em>how tired they obviously are of Hedgie fuckery</em>. I always recommend you watch these kinds of things, but today you need to <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/live/">WATCH THIS THANG!!!!</a> (Or at least give the statements I linked above a good read. I promise you it will jack your tits!) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>
<p>A little detail from Gary Gensler's statement, since we've all been wondering what the heck he thinks of all this, given his hardass street cred from 2008...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Gary's statement focuses on the following 7 points:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gamification and User Experience</strong></li>
<li><strong>Payment for Order Flow</strong></li>
<li><strong>Equity Market Structure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Short Selling and Market Transparency</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social Media</strong></li>
<li><strong>Market “Plumbing”: Clearance and Settlement</strong></li>
<li><strong>System-Wide Risks</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Key takeaways:</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>He's trying to trim down settlement time to T+1 or T+0 (same day)</strong></li>
<li><strong>They are aware of dark pools and are investigating</strong>, <em>"While the public generally thinks of the markets as public exchanges like Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange, those big public markets had about 53 percent of the volume in January, according to public data. So where’s the other 47 percent? About 9 percent of January’s volume was executed at alternative trading systems. These alternative trading systems, commonly known as</em> <strong><em>dark pools</em></strong>*, emerged following the 1998 Regulation ATS rules, taking advantage of then-new advances in the internet and communications technologies.  That leaves about 38 percent, the majority of which was executed by off-exchange wholesalers, a group that of firms that have been taking a growing share of trading volume. As publicly available data on reported trades show, just seven wholesalers made up the vast majority of this 38 percent.* <strong><em>One firm, Citadel Securities, has publicly stated that it executes about 47 percent of all retail volume.</em></strong> <em>In January, two firms executed more volume than all but one exchange, Nasdaq."</em></li>

<p>👽Totally trippin Pink Cats theory: Alphabet entities have been preparing their game strategy before allowing chips to fall, and this will be a pivotal turning point in the legislation of the GME saga... basically things can start happening now. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n5idj9/801_and_nscc002/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">(Like NSCC-002)</a></p>

<h1>Who turned down the volume?</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>So not only are we continuing to see entire minute candles with zero volume like we did yesterday, this time happening TWICE.....</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ze4pnx5vsex61.png?width=1237&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0994ec83b2763e966c64517afee62ba9a9c08085">2 whole minutes with 0 volume on WeBull Lvl 2 yesterday</a></p>

<p>The negative 1 million drop caused the daily volume across all reported channels to fall to just a measly 1.7 million. That's the lowest it's been since... like... ever.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just so you know, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/lehman-brothers-collapse-causes-impact-4842338">this happened before Lehman Bros and Behr fell too.</a></p>

<h1>💎 <a href="https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU">Watch this OG Naked Short Selling documentary right heckin now</a> 💎</h1>
<p>17:10 is when they start discussing Corporate Elections. But you need to watch it all.</p>
<p>This documentary will help familiarize you with many of the <em>key</em> players that have been working for collective <em>decades</em> to expose and end the practice of naked short selling. Please, apes... pay homage to the apes that came before us- Like Dr. T, Carl Hagberg, Wes Christian, Darren Saunders (RIP), and more. This is the most worthy thing you could watch in your spare time right now. And it will also introduce you to the lovely, intelligent man that is Carl Hagberg, Retail Shareholder Rights Expert.</p>
<p>We are so thrilled to have someone with extensive knowledge and experience with Shareholder Voting, especially before our Annual Meeting on 6/9.</p>
<p><strong>Our AMA with Carl will be Wednesday, 05-12-2021 at 4pm Eastern. Details to come!</strong></p>

<h1>Voting</h1>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/nii0hze4dex61.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0369a2daf01c9d094c759e36bc407cf319b67258">Oh lawd they votin</a></p>
<p>Fidelity users, TDA, WeBull, Vanguard, Schwab, and more all reported being able to get their hands on their control number and vote as of yesterday. Feel free to drop a comment below if you have already voted and want to show that off! (I'll even give some voting flairs if you want!)</p>
<p>Be sure to check your inbox and contact your broker if you have any questions. And also be sure that if you have multiple brokerages accounts, you will need to get a different control number for each one. So if you carry shares in 3 different brokerage accounts (I do, cuz I don't trust a bitch) then you will have 3 different control numbers and will be voting 3 different times.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Voting:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER</li>
</ol>
<p>Obtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.</p>
<ol>
<li>INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.</p>
<ol>
<li>UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>🐈 <strong>BUT PINK, WHAT IF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY CONTROL NUMBER YET?! 🦧</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, did you...</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your broker inbox for proxy info✔</li>
<li>Check your email✔</li>
<li>Send a message via your broker help/chat interface✔</li>
<li>Call your broker and request your control number✔</li>
<li>Look around the comments and other posts to see if any resources have been shared that might help you in your search✔</li>
<li>Check your broker's website for an FAQ- Many have a landing page with GME specific proxy info✔</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind some brokers just haven't issued them yet. And some are anticipating up to a week or longer wait before you can vote. Geez, it seems almost like they're having trouble finding the shares to vote or something. 🤔</p>
<p><strong>I can confirm that Robinhood and TDA are issuing control numbers that come up invalid when you enter them in the official Gamestop proxy website. I don't know what that means. I am still investigating why brokers seems to have their own landing page for proxy voting. Idk am not computer nerd, am just pink cat 🤷‍♀️ I can't wait to see what Carl has to say about that!!!!</strong></p>

<h1>Good Vibes from Pink Cat ☮✌💖🚀🌝🐈</h1>
<p>You saw Gary Gensler's statement about social media. He actually <em>confirmed</em> the fact that there are bad actors present online trying to sway public sentiment. <strong>FUD and shills are a real thing. The American government is acknowledging it. There wouldn't be so much attack 24/7 if we weren't on the verge of something incredible.</strong> So I urge you to always ignore (but report) the FUD and the attacks. And continue to live by the Ape's Creed of being excellent, and ape no fight ape. Remember the squeeze will not make us better people. That starts now.</p>
<p>Hopefully by now we all realize that we are in charge of defending this golden think tank that has been likened to the city of Athens. We are fostering and nurturing knowledge and growth that is going to <em>change the trajection of human history</em>. Look at the caliber of people that are coming to speak to us in our AMAs and helping us address the issues of fraud in our economic marketplace and naked short selling. <strong>Do you think all of this progress would be happening if we were crazy? Especially happening this quickly? We did sign up for a rocket trip, after all.</strong> 🐱‍🚀🐱‍🚀🐱‍🚀</p>
<p><strong>Don't gamble more than you can afford to lose. Make sure GME isn't your life plan. Eat as healthy as you can afford. Drink lots of water. Get a little sunshine every day. Hug your family, your pets, and your GME extra tight every day. And make love, not war. ✌💖🦄🐈</strong></p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/4kwrrkqq5ex61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d8f86335bc6c7d6bfa22c46cd53ef1d130d0e52</p>
<p><strong>Be excellent to each other!!!</strong></p>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>We are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This helps us weed out the shills really fast, because if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</strong></p>
<p>Remember the fundamentals of this company.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can.</p>
