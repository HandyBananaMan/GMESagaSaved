So where\u2019s the other 47 percent? About 9 percent of January\u2019s volume was executed at alternative trading systems. These alternative trading systems, commonly known as* ***dark pools***\\*, emerged following the 1998 Regulation ATS rules, taking advantage of then-new advances in the internet and communications technologies.  That leaves about 38 percent, the majority of which was executed by off-exchange wholesalers, a group that of firms that have been taking a growing share of trading volume. As publicly available data on reported trades show, just seven wholesalers made up the vast majority of this 38 percent.\\* ***One firm, Citadel Securities, has publicly stated that it executes about 47 percent of all retail volume.*** *In January, two firms executed more volume than all but one exchange, Nasdaq.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Also check out the section on Social Media (dat us)**\n\n[\ud83d\udc40GARY GENSLER JUST CONFIRMED FUD AND SHILLS ARE A THING!\ud83d\udc40 ](https://preview.redd.it/lthhqrjfbex61.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29d03824c18e0ddcfd3b0e57fd827b5d9912698)\n\n# \"To be clear, I'm not concerned about regular investors exercising their free speech online.

Feel free to drop a comment below if you have already voted and want to show that off! (I'll even give some voting flairs if you want!)\n\nBe sure to check your inbox and contact your broker if you have any questions. And also be sure that if you have multiple brokerages accounts, you will need to get a different control number for each one. So if you carry shares in 3 different brokerage accounts (I do, cuz I don't trust a bitch) then you will have 3 different control numbers and will be voting 3 different times.\n\n**Steps to Voting:**\n\n1. HAVE YOUR CONTROL NUMBER\n\nObtained from your broker, not to be shared with anyone. This number should be confidential.\n\n2. INPUT THAT CONTROL NUMBER THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS ONLY (THROUGH THE GAMESTOP CORPORATE SITE OR LINKS FROM YOUR BROKER).\n\nDo not input your control number unless you are 100% sure that the site is legit.\n\n3. UNDERSTAND WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE VOTING FOR.\n\nTake a moment to see what the board recommends you vote for if you are unsure. This community can not tell you how to vote, only you can decide that.\n\n4. SUBMIT YOUR BALLOT.\n\n5. SHARE WITH EVERYONE HOW PROUD YOU ARE TO HAVE VOTED.\n\n**Gamestop's Board of Directors is urging everyone to vote as soon as possible.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\ud83d\udc08 **BUT PINK, WHAT IF I HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY CONTROL NUMBER YET?! \ud83e\udda7**\n\n**Well, did you...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Check your broker inbox for proxy info\u2714\n* Check your email\u2714\n* Send a message via your broker help/chat interface\u2714\n* Call your broker and request your control number\u2714\n* Look around the comments and other posts to see if any resources have been shared that might help you in your search\u2714\n* Check your broker's website for an FAQ- Many have a landing page with GME specific proxy info\u2714\n\nKeep in mind some brokers just haven't issued them yet. And some are anticipating up to a week or longer wait before you can vote. Geez, it seems almost like they're having trouble finding the shares to vote or something. \ud83e\udd14\n\n**I can confirm that Robinhood and TDA are issuing control numbers that come up invalid when you enter them in the official Gamestop proxy website.

He actually *confirmed* the fact that there are bad actors present online trying to sway public sentiment. **FUD and shills are a real thing. The American government is acknowledging it. There wouldn't be so much attack 24/7 if we weren't on the verge of something incredible.** So I urge you to always ignore (but report) the FUD and the attacks. And continue to live by the Ape's Creed of being excellent, and ape no fight ape. Remember the squeeze will not make us better people. That starts now.\n\nHopefully by now we all realize that we are in charge of defending this golden think tank that has been likened to the city of Athens. We are fostering and nurturing knowledge and growth that is going to *change the trajection of human history*. Look at the caliber of people that are coming to speak to us in our AMAs and helping us address the issues of fraud in our economic marketplace and naked short selling. **Do you think all of this progress would be happening if we were crazy?
