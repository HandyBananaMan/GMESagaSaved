<p>The Head of the DTCC just confirmed live in the HFSC meeting that the only margin issue in January was Robinhood. Meaning that Melvin and Citadel were in fact not margin called in the January squeeze. </p>
<p>In interview with</p>
<p>-18:00 and running timestamp</p>

<p>Edit 2: This means the shorts were never <strong>forced to cover</strong></p>
<p>Edit 3: This confirms Citadel and point 72 offered capital in January to Robinhood and Melvin to prevent a Margin Call on their own positions.</p>

<p>Edit 5: This does not mean they voluntarily covered this means they are most likely still holding their positions.</p>
<p>Edit 6:  Unclear Theory Removed*</p>
<p>Edit 7: For clarity, removed some more inflammatory wording this was written in a rush while I was streaming and live charting. </p>
<p><strong>For this I apologize.</strong></p>
<p>I do not mean this to imply that zero short positions have been covered on the stock as I do agree with some of the sentiment below that some short positions covered in January. But this does show pretty definitive proof that the 3 Billion lent to Melvin their $4.5B in losses and the $1B lent to Robinhood were all in order to prevent a margin call. </p>
<p>That's 7.5 Billion in losses to prevent a margin call on Melvin. We know Archegos was 7x margined(Confirmed in today's HFSC meeting) from this we can infer from Melvin's 12.5 billion in holdings they may have had <strong>up to</strong> $87.5B held in margin. The actual number may not be this high. But there was definitely a vested interest in preventing a margin call on Melvin in order to provide them with 1/4 of their worth in an immediate loan. </p>
<p>I do still contend that even at the lowest average price period from 2/2-2/24 the average price was 57.76  at this cost it would have been $4.62B to cover 80 million reported shares sold short. Additional that's only 17 trading days (3 of which had overall volume of less than 10 million)so they would have had to cover 4.705M shares a day or 200 shares per tick. There is no way to do this and keep the price at an average of 57.76. Nor have Citadel or Melvin disclosed financials to indicate losses sufficient to have bought in at higher prices. (Melvin $4.5B, and Citadel 3%)</p>
<p>So this leaves us with the fact that $4.5B from Melvin and another $4B From Citadel and Point 72 were spent to keep Robinhood and Melvin from being margin called. The head of the DTCC also confirmed Robinhood's liquidity issues were immediately resolved so buying should have never been halted. That's $8 billion in liquid capital, and blatant fraud. Committed to prevent a margin call on Melvin. "As nobody was pushed into that position".
