In my last post I highlighted that Interactive Brokers is exiting membership of the MBS division of the FICC.

It seems today the Fed is removing a special account from DTCC membership. From previous research I believe this is because of the new rules we've seen being put into place wherein the MEMBERS of the DTCC are the first parties to pay for any default of other members before the DTCC will start paying for itself. 

I believe members are trying to exit stage left before the DTCC can foot them with astronomical bills - anyone who does not need to be there for their business to function should all start departing. We can watch over the next few weeks.

If anyone knows what the purpose (unlikely to be public information) of this special account is, please enlighten us all.
