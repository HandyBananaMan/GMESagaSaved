<p>NSCC’s role in the market is a neutral one. <strong>It does not impose trading restrictions upon its clearing members or their customers, and it did not instruct any clearing member to impose restrictions during the market volatility events of late January</strong>. NSCC expects all clearing members to employ effective tools to monitor and manage their risk, and to maintain an appropriate level of capital to support any expansion of or change in their business activities. Clearing fund requirements are rules-based and subject to limited discretion. NSCC exercises this discretion carefully, often in unique circumstances. In such cases, NSCC’s sole objective is to balance the need to protect the system from a potential clearing member default against the damage and other risks that could result if NSCC were to cease-to-act and liquidate a clearing member’s portfolio</p>
