<p>Don't think about buying back your initial investments. Don't think that the number you see in your screen is enough. </p>
<p>Think about others. Think about the ones who need it most. Think about the lives that we lost. Think about those who are struggling, those who are going hungry, or sleeping in their cars. </p>
<p>The longer you hold, the more help others will get. This is one of the few times where doing nothing will return greater things. </p>
<p>Apes stronger together. Hold the line. Do good things.</p>
