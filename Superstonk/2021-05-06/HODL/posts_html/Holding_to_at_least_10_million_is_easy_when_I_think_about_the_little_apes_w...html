<h1>Title: Holding to at least $10 million is easy when I think about the little apes who need it most. I hold not for Greed. Greed is what fueled the Hedgefunds. I hold to make sure all sized apes from every jungle can get their fill of bananas. A tribe grows stronger when the smaller ones are fed first.</h1>

<p>Don't think about buying back your initial investments. Don't think that the number you see in your screen is enough. </p>
<p>Think about others. Think about the ones who need it most. Think about the lives that we lost. Think about those who are struggling, those who are going hungry, or sleeping in their cars. </p>
<p>The longer you hold, the more help others will get. This is one of the few times where doing nothing will return greater things. </p>
<p>Apes stronger together. Hold the line. Do good things.</p>
