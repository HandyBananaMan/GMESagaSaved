I could not be prouder of this subreddit than I was after watching Wes Christian on Fox News today. This movement, this ideal, this belief that an individual person can make a huge difference is truly playing out in front of all of us. It's unbelievable to me that 6 short months ago, hedge funds had free reign to do whatever the hell they pleased, in the dark, without consequence. Now, with every step they take, there's a shrewdness of apes, both wrinkle and smooth brained, banding together to bring to light these very practices.

Hats off to the mods for being engaged, active, and passionate about the movement. I don't just hodl for tendies, I hold for humanity.
