    "selftext": "I could not be prouder of this subreddit than I was after watching Wes Christian on Fox News today. This movement, this ideal, this belief that an individual person can make a huge difference is truly playing out in front of all of us. It's unbelievable to me that 6 short months ago, hedge funds had free reign to do whatever the hell they pleased, in the dark, without consequence. Now, with every step they take, there's a shrewdness of apes, both wrinkle and smooth brained, banding together to bring to light these very practices.\n\nHats off to the mods for being engaged, active, and passionate about the movement. I don't just hodl for tendies, I hold for humanity.",
