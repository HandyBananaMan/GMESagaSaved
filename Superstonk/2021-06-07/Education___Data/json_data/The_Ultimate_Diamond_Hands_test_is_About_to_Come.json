Of all the *concentrated*,*particular stocks*  in January's madness - GME sold the highest dollar amount by $496  billion. Second was \\[Movie Stock\\], at $4b. \\[Movie stock\\] has since surpassed its January  peak by over 350%. Just saying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy take:\n\n1. It confirms my bias\n2. Clearly shows how BIG the real underlying issue is. In my humble opinion as an investor, the moment the real MOASS happens, we will see the stock market sink to the 50%-60% level. I will use that as my indication that finally it is happening.\n3. That this is, like in 2008 with MBS, a systemic issue, that once it breaks it will produce massive disruptions. In 2008, everyone thought they discovered a secret formula for perpetual profits, it failed. The era of 2008-2020 the \"perfect formula\" is the HFT and all these little abusive exploits (naked shorting, FTD, T+ cycles, etc etc)  that went into steroids thanks to the insane amounts of money, leverage, speed, algorithms, etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely, when this breaks loose, it will be like you are in a ship at sea in the middle of the worst storm of a decade, it will swing up and down in huge waves, all those HFT and algos trying to save themselves and pushing prices up and down. \n\nImagine for a moment GME going to 1623$ in a couple of days, then running back down to 815$ the next day... then UP and Down Up and Down, \n\nThat will be the ultimate Diamond Hands Test, the will be shaking the banana tree, so make sure that your objectives are set and that you know your floor.\n\nAgain, this is not financial advise, and I can only vouch for my own idea of how I will psychologically manage myself through this but since you are insisting in knowing here is my formula:\n\n90% I have already relieved myself from the stress of \"when\" to sell, because I will NOT\n\n10% I will AFTER I see the following happening: a) The stock market has crashed 50-60% b) GME is basing at some absurd number in the with at least 6 zeroes ( could be 1 , 2, 10 ,20 ,40 ,50 million) I do not know where it will be, but all i know is that it will be OBVIOUS.\n\nLast but not least, the REAL Problem is going to be YOU (ME, the Ape).\n\nWe have at this point in time discussed in massive depth all the reasons WHY WE ARE RIGHT,\n\nBUT\n\nwe have yet to look into ourselves and understand our psychology about all this.\n\nI spent some time years ago going to a Trading Psychologist to help myself with my trading, because believe it or not , \n\nIT WAS EASY FOR ME TO HOLD ON TO MY LOSERS THAN TO MY WINNERS.\n\nFor this I would like to share a video that I think everyone needs to watch:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9Jpv-OXmc&t=1388s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9Jpv-OXmc&t=1388s)\n\nWhen things are going bad, HOPE kicks in and we are like strongholds, but as soon as we start seeing 1000$ 100000$ 200000$ and 1000000000$ numbers, the stress will build up.\n\nYOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO COPE WITH IT!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, again, not financial advise, I cannot tell you when to sell, specially when I myself plan NOT TO, so that I DO NOT CUT MY WINNERS SHORT.\n\nThanks for your time and of course OBLIGATORY: Diamond Hands, ROCKET, MOON!",
