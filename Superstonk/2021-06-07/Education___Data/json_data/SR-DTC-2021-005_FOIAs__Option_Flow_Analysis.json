    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nBefore starting with this informative data DD or whatever you want to call it, i'd like to bring to your attention the subject matter of the missing ruling/filing in regards to SR-DTC-2021-005.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uni4sgq6t371.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dec37fcb6695f8d303b02eb942d3d079b6e25ff\n\nThis ruling was filed by the SEC with the DTC and it was going to fix share rehypothecation, but someone removed it completely from the DTC website with no prior or post notice.\n\nMe and other apes have contacted the SEC and have requested information asking what happened to this document/ruling/filing and have used the FOIA / Freedom of information act to get this information.\n\nSince it's been 1-2 months of no communications in regards to the removal of this critical ruling, i believe it's extremely appropriate for anyone interested to ask the SEC about information in regards to SR-DTC-2021-005. It's your right and anyone telling you otherwise in my opinion is misinformed or has an agenda. You're not going to cause \"Delays\" as some people would like you to think by submitting these types of requests, the SEC has a department and people at hand specifically for processing FOIA requests.\n\nBesides, even if somehow you were creating \"delays\"... create delays in WHAT? The document has been removed and doesn't exist. By remaining silent and not exercising your right for information on this subject that directly affects you, you're indirectly contributing to the issue. If someone's truly removed SR-DTC-2021-005 maliciously, your silence is exactly what is needed for SR-DTC-2021-005 to never be seen again.\n\nSo again, please don't mindlessly parrot things like:\n\n* \"You'll cause delays\"\n* \"Don't spam the SEC with FOIA requests\"\n* \"It doesn't matter\"\n\nSR-DTC-2021-005 is GONE. It affects YOU and ME. Stay silent if you will. There are those of \"us\" who prefer action over inaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Me\n\nI've already filed my own FOIA request about a week ago with some replies so far. My intentions are to light a fire under whoever's ass it was that removed the SR-DTC-2021-005 document without following appropriate procedures (no notice of removal before or after).\n\nMy hope is that by filing a FOIA with the SEC in regards to the SR-DTC-2021-005, the SEC people will have a small investigation and check up with the person who signed SR-DTC-2021-005 and the person who filed and authored it.\n\nOnce questions are asked in regards to this SR-DTC-2021-005 and it's whereabouts with the SEC and DTCC, the internal paper trails should show where SR-DTC-2021-005 is, what happened to it, and who's responsible for it in general.\n\nIn the end, i filed a FOIA appeal form and personally requested to pay up to $1500 so that they'd spend more than 2hours of work checking this subject. I didn't have to. I offered because i think SR-DTC-2021-005 is important and i also want to light a fire under the ass of whoever intentionally or unintentionally removed it and i'm willing to pay to see that happen. Also i hold tons of GME, i'm not gonna have some guy at the DTC arbitrarily remove critical documents like this that affect me and you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# You\n\nI don't know what your intentions are with SR-DTC-2021-005 and honestly they don't concern me and neither should they concern my in any way. You're an ape, i'm an ape. There is no \"we\".\n\nI'm only pointing you to publicly available information. The Freedom of Information Act is literally your right. I would be skeptical of someone's intentions if someone told me not to submit a FOIA...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxbeu37wat371.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f61a979709f7903d88cc5a3edcf1c11e4207b1d9\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# BE POLITE. BE RESPECTFUL.\n\nIf you're going to fill in a FOIA request, don't be vulgar. Don't be just polite, be MORE than polite. There are people on the other side of the conversation.\n\n* You shitting on them in a FOIA request makes apes/retail look bad.\n* You shitting on them will get your FOIA rejected.\n* You being SNARKY in your FOIA request is likely not to get you the information you want.\n\nBE POLITE. BE RESPECTFUL. If you can't write a FOIA to the SEC without your blood boiling and letting your emotions overwhelm you, you have no business writing a FOIA request to the SEC.\n\n**Really, even if you are an ape, you can't just shit where you want to eat. Be polite.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efg4d6g9bt371.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e7a7b36d6be14be6c237177f84ee11d8b03e608\n\n# \n\n# Submitting a FOIA request\n\nNow, IF you TRULY want to be constructive and TRULY want to exercise your right in accordance to the FOIA / Freedom of information act, you can simply fill in the form below and submit it. That's it.\n\n**This is the form:** [https://www.sec.gov/forms/request\\_public\\_docs#no-back](https://www.sec.gov/forms/request_public_docs#no-back)\n\nANYONE CAN SEND A FOIA. Call me Mr Worldwide because i'm from the EU and i've submitted a FOIA. If i can do it, you can do it.\n\n**It's NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Extra information about FOIAs\n\nIf the SEC finds your FOIA request to be reasonable and does decide to service it, they'll likely assign 2 hours of free research to you as well as 100 pages max worth of print out material on the subject you requested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Mind you that they reserve the right to request $61 dollars up to $250 to process your FOIA request.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can offer to sponsor/pay any amount you like. If accepted, this will increase the research duration period & amount of print outs they'll make for the subject you requested.\n\nList of costs: [https://www.sec.gov/Article/foia-reference-guide.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Article/foia-reference-guide.htm)\n\nFree to paid cost tiers: [https://www.sec.gov/foia/howfo2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/foia/howfo2.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Special fields and how to fill them\n\nThere's a few fields in the electronic form that you may not be aware on how to fill. Here's a quick and easy guide/way on how to fill them.\n\nAlso here's the missing SR-DTC-2021-005 PDF\n\n* [https://www.file.io/download/thMvWcJ8wirp](https://www.file.io/download/thMvWcJ8wirp)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/teisku3vct371.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08aa49cbc3bc39706f83f5604795e0c2fe88630\n\n# Fee authorization\n\nThe FOIA is likely to be free, however you'll need to show your willingness to pay at least a certain amount for processing fees. If you're not willing to pay anything, click on \"Other Amount\" and put 0.\n\nI initially put $100 dollars in the field, they e-mails me back and said they'll do 2 hours of research for free and 100 pages of print outs. This is the free tier that is reserved for non-organizations e.g retail like you and me.\n\n***Mind you that they reserve the right to request $61 dollars up to $250 to process your FOIA request.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xo980wc9dt371.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f0a16f0b9436a6d9b5e085e835b45ba78902aa3\n\n# Fee Waiver\n\nThe SEC is very unlikely to waive your FOIA fee. It's more likely to assign you directly to their free service tier of 2hrs of research and 100 pages of print outs. They also still reserve the right to charge you or reject you. See previous terms above.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjqp6ux6et371.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=85c6993c69f5a3aa751dbd7ed5c6322afe642697\n\n# Expedited Request\n\n**Fill this with: \"NO\"**\n\nSimply because expedited delivery is only for critical situations like a court case and things like that. Since you're just requesting information just for the information, you don't fulfill the requirements for expedited treatment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsv8wgweet371.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=41403e18e55bf4495db0a25c341c3f5dda06fcb8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Now onto the option flow DD\n\n*(This was supposed to be an option flow DD only but then i the spirit of SR-DTC-2021-005 came to my sleep and told me to avenge it).*\n\nHere's some basic legends:\n\n* **DTE:** Days to expiry\n* **OI:** Open Interest (Current snapshot of how many contracts have been purchased)\n* **Premium:** Amount paid in $ for those option contracts\n* **Volume:** Amount of option contracts purchased\n\nThe source of the data is a live option flow streaming service called BlackBoxStocks. It's pretty expensive, but i pay for it so i can get this nice juicy data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# 1 Month Option Flow (May 5 - June 4)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wfr6dq5gt371.png?width=1611&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4c8a30a2203496aa5cb38734f361d577e8240d\n\n* As i posted in my previous DD about the option flow, those big spikes for PUTs at the $0.5 - 5$ range were made in 1 single multi-leg order all at the same time for a premium of around $61 million dollars on the 23'rd of May with an expiry of January 2022 and January 2023.\n* Additionally, there was a huge amount of ITM puts purchased near the end of May at $300 puts. I speculated that these were somehow a safety buffer so that they could flash crash the price when we reached a price near $300 and indeed that's what happened once we touched $292 and got puked down to $252.Market mechanics don't work like that. Buying puts at $300 and exercising them shouldn't do that. It's not how it works. I do have my own theory on how they're using those $300 puts though to achieve a \"crash\" and it's ridiculous to believe that they'd go this far... but i won't mention it here. Let's keep this purely data driven and speculation-less.\n* Call open interest at $800 is still as huge as ever, about 120 million shares worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1 Week Option Flow (May 31 - June 4)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqvyb8626t371.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b5cc94f4900ebda1319f3f288ae6ec881208c42\n\nThis data indicates last week's option flow. You can purely see what was done in terms of options last week.\n\n* We can see a spike in volume for $300 calls all mostly short expiry dated. Indicates the likeliness of retail and less likely to be big money.\n* We can see that puts still prefer those 2022 January and 2023 January dates. Very sus. Indicates someone with big money and not retail.\n* OTM put options purchased at $20-50 ranges. At least they didn't go for the super OTM $0.5 to 5$ range they usually do.\n* Some decent put purchases at the $230 range.\n\nI have another chart/analytic that shows me the Max Pain based on a few or all days of the last week. I've seen that if i adjust the max pain analytic to only use 1-2-3 days of the week that the Max Pain point moves almost exactly as GME's price. Last week's Max Pain was fluctuating between $250 - $290 with the majority of the time being at the $290 range.\n\nCurrent full week data still indicate that Max Pain is at $290. If this IS true, then it means the $250 dump is 100% artificial and done via ETFs or something else we're not aware of and that it will recover to $290 and likely more due to the momentum from $250 to $290. My educated guess is that we're going to see $317 tomorrow 6/8/2021 and that's just the start as the option tug of war is lost by the other side.",
