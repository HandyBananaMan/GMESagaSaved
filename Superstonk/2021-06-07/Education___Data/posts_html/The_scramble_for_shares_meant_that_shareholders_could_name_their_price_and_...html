<p>Education flair because it shows what is possible in a short squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR:</strong> There has never been a squeeze before where Shorts have come across an opposition with a price target. Every other squeeze is disorganised. People take profits on the way up, and the squeeze unravels. The closest equivalent to the MOASS we have is the VW squeeze where it was 'organised' as far as one shareholder held the power.</p>
<p>And it was only ended after that shareholder, Porsche, decided to let them off the hook.</p>
<p>If we don't let them off. 30million is not a joke.</p>
<p>And together we change the world.</p>
<p><strong>Main</strong>: Many of you would know by now about the VW short squeeze of 2008. But <img alt="this article" src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/3281537/Porsche-and-VW-share-row-how-Germany-got-revenge-on-the-hedge-fund-locusts.html" /> was a really good write up of the situation.</p>
<p>The TL:DR of the squeeze. Porsche swallowed up most of VW's shares through options. When it was announced that there was 5% of the float remaining and 12% was sold short, there was a panic to cover their positions - the short squeeze.</p>
<p>As the article states: <strong>The scramble for shares meant that shareholders could name their price.</strong></p>
<p>Now its important to note, there were two main shareholders in VW. Porsche and a Local government (with as I understand it a set stake). So Porsche became controllers of the situation just like we Apes are now.</p>
<p>The price made VW the most valuable company in the world. Porsche made more from the squeeze then selling cars. And then Porsche released a portion of the shares for the squeeze to unravel. And it still took 4 days to see a 50% drop from the peak.</p>
<p><strong>Repeat: After Porsche released the squeeze, it took 4 days for the price to drop 50% from its highest point, before going down to its normal value.</strong></p>
<p>The main takeaway here is: Don't sell this one-time-only opportunity short by trying to take profits on the way up. The more we diamond hand, the higher this goes, and the more lives we can impact.</p>
<p>You wont miss the squeeze. Trust your fellow Apes. We got here in the first place because we trusted the DD, we trusted our communal peer-review, and we trusted each other that we all liked the stock.</p>
<p>So trust that we will still like the stock as we fly past the moon and we will leave an indelible mark in human history.</p>
<p>45mins until German pre-market. Suppose I'm just rambling into the ether of the community I'm so fond of.</p>
