<p><strong>Ken Griffin's wife sits on the board that runs News Corp.</strong></p>
<p>What do you suppose the chance is that Murdoch is not in cahoots with Citadel, and would allow any sort of Pro-GME, Anti-NakedShorting, Anti-Citadel rhetoric to take place if for not some motive?</p>
<p>Me? I think it's zero.</p>
<p>So what, Murdoch runs Fox News and that's just a piece of the pie. Right? Wrong. He owns News Corp, which owns:</p>

<p>Yeah, that's right - NY Post, WSJ, Marketwatch among a slew of others (full list in the wiki); all of which have been found to be some of the "best" time-traveling sources of FUD.</p>
<p>I wonder why... could it be because News Corps' narrative is built by the Murdoch et al. board, the same board that Ken Griffin's wife sits on?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="calculating..." src="https://preview.redd.it/l8phpm07qy371.png?width=517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=284586231cc66eaa67a5637ba14a64534063a974" /></p>
<p>Yeah I think it probably is.</p>
<p>Be weary apes, I worry MSM is working to build a bit of trust "as one of us" in any sense so that they can build (another) conduit between the FUD and us.</p>
<p>Personally, I can't imagine watching corporate news for really any reason - but let it be known that they do not give a fuck about you, us, or really anything besides money for themselves and their investor's interests. <strong>That includes when they say something that confirms a bias you hold.</strong></p>
<p>Ignore the noise. IMO, we should stop spreading MSM's messages entirely. Cut them off. Controlling and wielding the narrative in 'the paper' is useless if nobody reads it...</p>
<p>I'm sure this goes a lot deeper, and I'm sure there's plenty to unravel if we start following the money thru CNBC as well - but I just wanted to quickly point out Fox News' conflict of interest in the matter, now that they're seemingly growing any kind of trust beyond 0 w/ apes.</p>
