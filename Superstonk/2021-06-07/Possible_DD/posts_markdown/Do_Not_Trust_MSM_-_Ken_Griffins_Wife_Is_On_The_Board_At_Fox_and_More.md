What do you suppose the chance is that Murdoch is not in cahoots with Citadel, and would allow any sort of Pro-GME, Anti-NakedShorting, Anti-Citadel rhetoric to take place if for not some motive?

Me? I think it's zero.

So what, Murdoch runs Fox News and that's just a piece of the pie. Right? Wrong. He owns News Corp, which owns:

Yeah, that's right - NY Post, WSJ, Marketwatch among a slew of others (full list in the wiki); all of which have been found to be some of the "best" time-traveling sources of FUD.

I wonder why... could it be because News Corps' narrative is built by the Murdoch et al. board, the same board that Ken Griffin's wife sits on?

Yeah I think it probably is.

Be weary apes, I worry MSM is working to build a bit of trust "as one of us" in any sense so that they can build (another) conduit between the FUD and us.

Personally, I can't imagine watching corporate news for really any reason - but let it be known that they do not give a fuck about you, us, or really anything besides money for themselves and their investor's interests. **That includes when they say something that confirms a bias you hold.**

Ignore the noise. IMO, we should stop spreading MSM's messages entirely. Cut them off. Controlling and wielding the narrative in 'the paper' is useless if nobody reads it...

I'm sure this goes a lot deeper, and I'm sure there's plenty to unravel if we start following the money thru CNBC as well - but I just wanted to quickly point out Fox News' conflict of interest in the matter, now that they're seemingly growing any kind of trust beyond 0 w/ apes.
