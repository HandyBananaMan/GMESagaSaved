    "selftext": "Alright so put on your tinfoil hats and prepare those titties my ape friends because I have a theory I would like to discuss with you all. Before I start, I need to mention that this is in no way financial advice. I am just an ape who has dabbled in investing for the last few years but got balls deep into the GME saga just as you all did back in January. With that being said, I am going to reference some points that have been mentioned, discussed, and fact-checked many times here in the last few months, so if you're questioning any of the assumptions made here, there is plenty of DD to back up why I came to different conclusions. Now, to the juicy stuff you all came here for!\n\nLet's start with the question on all of our minds... **WHY THE SHIFT IN NARRATIVE BY THE MSM?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't find it right now (I will edit my post and put it here if I can find it again)\n\n**EDIT: Found it!** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nuk6nk/the\\_mainstream\\_media\\_changed\\_its\\_narrative/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nuk6nk/the_mainstream_media_changed_its_narrative/)\n\nBut I saw a post earlier either here or in the movie stock sub, talking about how its specifically been News Corp owned media talking about short selling in the last week. Now, I have my problems with News Corp, nobody should have THAT much ownership of MSM companies, but let's take a look a who's invested into News Corp, shall we?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ownership of News Corp. according to FINTEL](https://preview.redd.it/nqhhify44x371.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=79a7eb09dd6c93df76a0184513a0298e52bf5279)\n\n[https://fintel.io/so/us/nws](https://fintel.io/so/us/nws)\n\nWell well, look who we've got up top... our frenemies, **Vanguard and Blackrock**. Now, Citadel also owns a portion of News Corp, even increasing their position from 5 mill shares in Jan 2021 to 6.5 mill shares in March 2021, but combined, Vanguard and Blackrock own **more than 10x what Citadel does.**\n\nNow, we've all been suspecting that when the MOASS happens, the Fed and the Banks would throw some SHFs under the bus, **WHAT IF THE NARRATIVE IS STARTING RIGHT NOW!?** Think about it, if you wanted to create a scapegoat for when all this shit goes down, **wouldn't it make sense to start talking about these issues and start talking about how short selling stocks is a problem to market stabilization? THEY'RE PAINTING A CLEAR ENEMY TO THE MASSES SO WHEN SHIT CONVENIENTLY HITS THE FAN SOON, SHFs ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE EVERYONE WILL BLAME.**\n\nI know the media aren't our friends, so I've been wracking my brain on why they would be talking about this now... **ITS BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE ENDGAME AND THEY NEED TO THROW SOMEONE UNDER THE BUS SOON.** This is the ONLY way that any of this makes sense to me.\n\nI know I'm making some assumptions here, but it is awfully convenient that Vanguard and Blackrock are some of the biggest investors in News Corp, where we're seeing these stories. We have every right to be weary of the MSM, but I don't think they're talking about this for apes.  I think they're talking about this for **THEMSELVES.** I would love some more discussion on this, but I feel it in my bones, we're so close.\n\n**TL:DR:** A post earlier mentioned we keep seeing the MSM stories about short selling on News Corp owned media. Vanguard and Blackrock are top holders of News Corp. I think they're running this narrative to paint the SHFs as the bad guys, so when the economy dumps and the MOASS happens, the masses will blame SHFs. Just like was predicted so long ago by apes smarter than I. BUY and HOLD my friends, the Tendieman cometh soon \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc \ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19\n\nEDIT 2:\nu/CookShack67 posted some juicy info below too!
