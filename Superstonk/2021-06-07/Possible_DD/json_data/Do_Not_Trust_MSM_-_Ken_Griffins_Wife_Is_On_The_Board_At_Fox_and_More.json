IMO, we should stop spreading MSM's messages entirely. Cut them off. Controlling and wielding the narrative in 'the paper' is useless if nobody reads it...\n\nI'm sure this goes a lot deeper, and I'm sure there's plenty to unravel if we start following the money thru CNBC as well - but I just wanted to quickly point out Fox News' conflict of interest in the matter, now that they're seemingly growing any kind of trust beyond 0 w/ apes.",
