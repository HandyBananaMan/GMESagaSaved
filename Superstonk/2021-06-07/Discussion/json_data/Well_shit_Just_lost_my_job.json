    "selftext": "So, I am not a struggling ape, although I do work hard for a living.\n\nToday, however, for the first time in my 25 year career, I have lost my job.   (Happy to provide proof to mods if needed).\n\nI am struggling emotionally guys.   I feel worthless and lost.  I know I can find another job eventually, but I felt like such a failure telling my wife and kids before they left for their school / work.   On my kids birthday too.\n\nReally, so much suck......\n\nI just needed a place to vent.  No need for any charity.  I just needed to scream \"virtually\"\n\n\"FUCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for an update:  I want to thank you all for the awards and words.  Honestly I dont need the awards (save your money for GME) and I wish my first gold was on a more positive post.   But thank you all very much.\n\nSecond update:  Doorbell rang for a delivery.  And guess who showed up but my Bananya from Gamestop.  Timing couldnt have been more perfect as I really needed the hug.  I am gonna cuddle with it until I have to give it up to my kid :)\n\nLast edit:  This community has brought me a lot of laughs and tears today.  What we do in this group is so far beyond the Stonk and I dont think people see that.   With that said I have spent a lot of the day trying to keep up with replies and I need to step away to take some time to reflect.   If I didnt respond to you, please know it isnt because I dont appreciate you.  I really, truly, do",
