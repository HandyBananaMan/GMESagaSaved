Today, however, for the first time in my 25 year career, I have lost my job.   (Happy to provide proof to mods if needed).

I am struggling emotionally guys.   I feel worthless and lost.  I know I can find another job eventually, but I felt like such a failure telling my wife and kids before they left for their school / work.   On my kids birthday too.

Really, so much suck......

I just needed a place to vent.  No need for any charity.  I just needed to scream "virtually"

"FUCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!"

Second update:  Doorbell rang for a delivery.  And guess who showed up but my Bananya from Gamestop.  Timing couldnt have been more perfect as I really needed the hug.  I am gonna cuddle with it until I have to give it up to my kid :)
