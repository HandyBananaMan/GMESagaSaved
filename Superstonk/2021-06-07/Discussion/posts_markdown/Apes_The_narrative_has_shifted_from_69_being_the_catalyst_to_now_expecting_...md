#Title: Apes! The narrative has shifted from 6/9 being the catalyst to now expecting a flash crash! It is good to expect nothing BUT this narrative has gone too far the other way, and I think it is FUD. Here's why:

Yes yes yes, we know. Media attention picking up. People talking about naked shorts. It seems like the perfect set up to jack all of our tits and then tank it, shaking off a ton of apes. 

BUT here is what we know:

1. Memelord RC has been tweeting more lately. He also picked 6/9 himself in all likelihood. He could have picked another date, but no he picked this date and only recently confirmed it. If he didn't have anything why would he? He knows apes are gonna hype this day up so why take a risk if its just an average meeting/earnings? Maybe he has something up his sleeve because lets be real, if APES are expecting fuckery then he definitely is too

2. Memelord DFV has been insanely active and addressing the meeting/RC directly in his edits. Again, why jack everyone's tits if this is still months away? Keeping morale high is great but it only lasts a few days.

3. Gamestop has been LIKING moass tweets. These don't show up everywhere so its not some marketing tactic. In my opinion, their tits are just as jacked as ours. 

4. VOTES! We are pretty much certain the vote count will be massive. Sure there will be fuckery but we can't go in assuming that.

My theory: They've successfully managed to infiltrate a good strat (don't hype up 6/9 because we may be disappointed) and turned it into something else (EXPECT A CRASH aka don't buy till the crash). When our tits were fully jacked for 6/9 we were buying like crazy in the lead up to it. But now? days before the fucking meeting we're making memes about expecting a crash! The stock is still pretty stable implying some institutional buying (covering) to match selling/shorting (aka resetting FTDs) 

TADR: APES! Don't fall for this FUD. Expect Nothing. But Also Expect Everything. Make your MOASS playlist. 

AND KEEP THOSE TITS JACKED. This isn't a penis, there's no 4 hour limit.
