<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I've seen lots of posts telling apes to remove their 420.69 limit sell orders. <strong>Those limit sells might not be from Apes.</strong> I think hedge funds are placing limit sell orders in meme amounts to make us believe that apes are paperhanding.</p>
<p>DON't ASSUME IT'S APES JUST BECAUSE IT'S A MEME NUMBER!!</p>
<p>What do the hedge funds gain from this? Think about it, they know apes are looking at that data. And they have to sell to control the price anyway, so it is reasonable they will try to make it look as bad as possible or to shape the narrative around what the floor might be.</p>
<p>Expect this fuckery to continue all the way to the top. Expect $1337.69 limit sells. Expect $6969.69 limit sells. Expect $420420.69 limit sells. </p>
<p>DON't ASSUME IT'S APES JUST BECAUSE IT'S A MEME NUMBER!!</p>
<p>I think the apes sharing the 'remove your limit sell order' posts are  probably genuine apes trying to help. That is what is so insidious about this new FUD tactic.</p>
