# cnbc did a fucky wucky

As most of you have heard by now past saturday CNBC had a couple of "experts" on to talk about what is going on and blurted out naked short selling, after that there was a huge spike in the "google analytical" side and searches for naked short selling were through the roof (you can use [trends.google.com](https://trends.google.com) and check out "naked Shorts" for yourself ;) )

&#x200B;

[#nakedshorts](https://preview.redd.it/j2ls4aji8t371.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a4000a6797a2949f0b1d9fd8f28fd3abc825d0)

Also a funny comment the guy had was " don't think for a minute that hedgefunds haven't hired people and put them into these chatrooms (reddit) to keep these flames going"... hmmm who else had talked about paid shills before ðŸ¤” not sure sounds very familiar though.

People also seem to be making waves with #nakedshorts, so lets just say I hope this stays trending for a long while so more people can see wtf is going on and get more peoples eyes on this.

# Short selling restrictions

This is also something I've seen come by around friday/saturday, Big banks and prime brokers are now restricting short positions on GME AMC and MIcroVision (who the fuck is Microvision?)

Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and Jeffries are among those who have restricted them, expect more of them to follow.

# SEC Fires head Auditor

Possibly because he was "too friendly" with institutions he was supposed to be investigating and not taking the proper actions, as he mismanaged the regulator, so even if Gary is only on his 7th week, at least he is firing someone... cmon Gary move it buddy you have 2 days till the meeting.

I'm gonna be honest I like the guy (charles), but at the same time he works for MSM, that means I don't trust him, there usually narrative they want to push or whatever, but for this moment I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. I've seen this guy say stuff that he seems to be on the side of the apes but again I'd rather be carefull then get bent over, especially since he's been fined before for not mentioning that he received payment to promote a stock.

# G7 agree on worldwide taxation

Ok so this is something I've heard something about in the past few years, but to be honest I don't think anyone would ever actually make this deal but here we are.

The g7 (the richest 7 economies/countries of the world) agreed on a universal taxation across the board, meaning it would be increasingly difficult to hide their money in tax havens like the caymans and such. this would mean if a company (like amazon or FB or Citadel) operates in a country then they have to pay 15% tax THERE, not just where they store their money, but the countries they're profiting of.

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.
