<p><strong>TL;DR: GME will almost certainly switch from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 Index this month. However, the data indicates it is unlikely to have either a bearish or bullish impact on the share price. Nonetheless, the company is continuing to edge closer to inclusion within the S&amp;P 500 Index later in the year. Due to asset management firms' far higher use of the S&amp;P 500 for their Index ETFs (about 30x more than the Russell 1000), this possible inclusion is much more likely to provide an upward catalyst for the GME share price than the Russell reconstitution.</strong></p>
<p>I originally posted this DD about a month ago. There was not much interest in the Russell Indexes at the time (and it anyway got lost amongst a bunch of memes), so there was not much interest in my DD! However as there has been some movement with this recently, I have seen some posts/DD that appears to be purely speculative and not looking at the data itself. So I am reposting my previous findings once again.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p>There was a post earlier today, regarding GME's impending switch from the Russell 2000 Index to the Russell 1000 Index:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ntwd1h/gamestop_removed_from_the_russell_microcap_may_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>
<p>This DD stated this switch could be bullish for the stock, but did not present data specific to GME stock in supporting this assertion. I would like to present some findings specific to GME, which I gathered by going into the ETFs tied to the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 Indexes.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST, SOME IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p><em>"The Russell 2000® Index measures the performance of the small-cap segment of the US equity universe. The Russell 2000® Index is a subset of the Russell 3000® Index representing approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of that index. It includes approximately 2,000 of the  smallest securities based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership."</em>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A stock cannot be in both the Russell 2000 and Russell 1000 indexes i.e. it is in one or the other. If a stock moves from one of these indexes to the other, ETFs tied to them must add (i.e. buy) or remove (i.e. sell) the stock accordingly. Note that a company being in one index or another ultimately does not have an impact on its shares or share price. <strong>What really matters is which ETFs it is held in and how many shares of the company are held in each of these ETFs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ETFs TIED TO THE RUSSELL 2000 INDEX</strong></p>
<p>Here are the ETFs which use the Russell 2000 to determine the stocks they hold:</p>
<p>https://etfdb.com/index/russell-2000-index/</p>
<p>There are only six such ETFs, and two of these account for 99.75% of their totals Assets Under Management (AUM): Blackrock's iShares Russell 2000 ETF which holds $67.185 billion AUM, and Vanguard's Russell 2000 ETF with $5.242 billion AUM.</p>
<p>I had a look at the holdings in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF on 6th May (when this DD was originally produced) and GME was the 10th largest constituent in this ETF. It actually holds 1,349,468 shares of GME. The data is updated on a daily basis, as required for all ETFs given they are required to undergo a Net Asset Valuation (NAV) calculation at the end of each trading day, and can be found here: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239710/ishares-russell-2000-etf</p>
<p>Next I had a look at the latest NAV data for the Vanguard's Russell 2000 ETF. This held 115,059 shares of GME on the same date. This can be verified here: https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/VTWO/portfolio-holdings</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Blackrock and Vanguard's Russell 2000 ETFs account for 99.75% of the AUMs tied to this index. These two ETFs hold a total of 1,349,468 + 115,059 = 1,464,527 shares of GME. </p>
<p><strong>ETFs TIED TO THE RUSSELL 1000 INDEX</strong></p>
<p>Here are the ETFs which use the Russell 1000 to determine their holdings/constituents:</p>
<p>https://etfdb.com/index/russell-1000-index/</p>
<p>There are only two such ETFs: Blackrock's iShares Russell 1000 ETF, which holds $28.423 billion AUM and Vanguard's Russell 1000 ETF, with $2.356 billion AUM. Combined, they hold AUM of $30.6 billion, so a little over 40% of the size of the two Russell 2000 ETFs from these same asset management firms.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> There are very few ETFs tied to the Russell 1000 Index, and these have much smaller AUMs than their Russell 2000 tracking counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GME SWITCHES?</strong></p>
<p>I can say that it is almost certain GME will move from the Russell 2000 Index to the Russell 1000 Index. GME's current market capitalisation of $17.58 billion, means that it is more 5x bigger now than the very largest of companies usually included in the Russell 2000 Index. In fact, this market capitalisation is comfortably higher the median capitalisation of Russell 1000 constituents i.e. GME is now one of the 500 largest listed firms by market capitalisation now (this is an important point, and I will come back to it later!) </p>
<p>Russell Index market capitalisation ranges can be found here: https://www.ftserussell.com/research-insights/russell-reconstitution/market-capitalization-ranges</p>
<p>So what happens when it is confirmed that GME is going to move to the Russell 1000 Index? Here is the mechanism that is followed for the reconstitution:</p>
<p><em>"May is “ranking” month when all eligible US companies are lined up to form the preliminary Russell Reconstitution portfolio. In 2021, the rank day falls on Friday, May 7.</em></p>
<p><em>June is the month that the preliminary reconstitution portfolio is communicated to the marketplace. Beginning on June 4, preliminary lists are communicated to the marketplace and updates are provided on June 11, 18, and 25. The newly reconstituted indexes take effect after the market close on June 25.</em></p>
<p>What this means is that asset management firms are currently being informed of the change. They have until June 25th to make changes to their tracking ETFs, in order to reflect the reconstituted indexes effective from June 26th.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this will mean that Blackrock and Vanguard will have to remove the 1,464,527 shares of GME they currently hold in their two Russell 2000 ETFs. A proportion of these will be moved to their Russell 1000 ETFs, given GME's transfer to that index, but it will certainly not be the full amount because:</p>
<p>(1) Those two Russell 1000 ETFs are a fraction of the size of the two Russell 2000 ETFs</p>
<p>(2) GME will be in a middle-higher spot in the market capitalisation ranking within the Russell 1000 Index, compared to their current top 10 spot in the Russell 2000 Index</p>
<p>(3) This means GME's weighting within those Russell 1000 ETFs will have to be smaller, so fewer shares needing to be held to accurately reflect the index</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Both Blackrock and Vanguard will probably have to reduce their GME share holdings when the switch takes place. (At least, for maintaining the accurate tracking of the Russell Indexes. They may just move those excess GME shares to their other ETFs or funds, of course i.e. not sell them in the open market.)</p>
<p><strong>OK...THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY PROMISING...</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I don't see this as much of a bearish event. It is probably only a reduction of a few hundred thousand shares at most, which is a fairly minor amount and unlikely to hurt the share price. We sometimes see this volume of GME shares being traded in the first hour after market opens. So I see this Russell Index reconstitution as having minimal impact on the share price, and even less impact on the MOASS (if it hasn't happened by late June!)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Based on the available data, not much to see here in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>THE INDEX THAT REALLY DOES MATTER: S&amp;P 500</strong></p>
<p>The Russell Indexes are actually more important for micro- and small-cap, than for mid-cap and larger firms such as what GME has now become. The reason being that the S&amp;P Indexes dominate in the larger cap area, whereas the Russell Indexes are more for the smaller cap arena. Hence the larger a firm grows, the more important the S&amp;P Indexes become.</p>
<p>As such, asset management firms tend to use the S&amp;P Indexes - and especially the S&amp;P 500 - for constructing their large cap Index ETFs. There are 14 S&amp;P 500 tied ETFs available and their combined AUMs are enormous, close to $900 billion i.e. about 30x bigger than the two Russell 1000 ETFs. Depending on GME's market capitalisation at the time, it could mean a huge number of shares being <em>mandatorily</em> having to be bought in the open market, so that these ETFs are correctly matching the S&amp;P 500 Index including GME.</p>
<p>Link: https://www.etf.com/channels/sp-500-etfs</p>
<p>Incidentally, criteria for entry to the S&amp;P 500 index are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Market capitalization must be greater than or equal to US$11.8 billion</p>
<p>(2) Annual dollar value traded to float-adjusted market capitalization is greater than 1.0</p>
<p>(3) Minimum monthly trading volume of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date</p>
<p>(4) Must be publicly listed on either the New York Stock Exchange (including NYSE Arca or NYSE American) or NASDAQ (NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Select Market or the NASDAQ Capital Market).</p>
<p>(5) The company should be from the U.S.</p>
<p>(6) The sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter</p>
<p>Link: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/governance/methodologies/#methodology-information</p>
<p>Assuming GME maintains a share above 167, criteria (1) on the above list is fulfilled, meaning it would only need to achieve criteria (6) to meet all six requirements. I think it is likely GME will  achieve this by Q3 earnings, so inclusion within the S&amp;P 500 is very possible after that. If that happens, then each of those S&amp;P 500 tracking ETFs is required to go out and buy the shares in the open market. </p>
<p>This is certain to create demand and upward movement to the share price, similar to Tesla's run after it was announced they would be entering the S&amp;P 500 about six months ago. (As a point of comparison Tesla’s share price increased by more than 70%, from when S&amp;P announced the inclusion to the rebalancing deadline date five weeks later. This was mainly fueled by the asset managers of these 14 ETFs having to buy the stock in the open market.)</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> For those of you who may be interested, I have produced a new DD specifically about the <em>potentially imminent</em> addition of GME to the S&amp;P 500:
