In other words, this post identifies some of the people who've been fucking with our favorite stock, among others, and possibly sheds light on the meaning of some of DFV and RC's recent tweets. Lots of corruption. Seriously disturbing stuff. And I think we're getting set up for a regulatory trap we can side step if we understand the game we've entered. Please take the time for this one.*\n\nHow many of you have watched the evolving manipulation of the meme stock narrative by hedge fund and bank controlled media outlets since January? I have, and it\u2019s been a fascinating shitshow. One of my serious hopes is that our community is the first step in a legitimized demand for the journalistic integrity we\u2019re showing, especially in market journalism. So as much as we\u2019re [memeing Melissa Lee at CNBC and though I think she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world when she says \u201cnaked shorts\u201d then analyzes her whoopsie with Shocked Pikachu Face retracement indicators](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nshffm/naked_shorts_just_confirmed_by_the_enemies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that are GameStop bullish, here\u2019s the fucked up thing that I hope we\u2019re all grasping:\n\nMelissa Lee was probably getting ripped to shreds in her earpiece in that moment for telling the truth. Why? Because saying \u201cnaked shorting\u201d is probably on a banned speech list at CNBC. Why? Something we should all know by now: the hedge funds and their bank friends actually own the market media outlets (directly; they\u2019re on the paperwork) and, when you\u2019re caught in a bad market yolo, the truth is costly unless you can suppress it or manipulate the people who\u2019ve called your bluff toward wrong conclusions.\n\nThat said, and to be transparent, I think what we\u2019re witnessing with companies outside of GameStop in the memes stock event is the set up for a devastating pump and dump that 1) helps hedge funds, big banks, and the Federal Reserve escape their liquidity problems, 2) aims to scare much of retail away from riding the GameStop MOASS rocket to the actual moon, and 3) gives big finance a narrative to leverage with the SEC to facilitate the regulation of retail\u2019s threat to their unchecked financial industry power. I\u2019ll bring as many receipts as possible and some tinfoil analysis to support that opinion. And please hear me clearly before hitting me with any *you\u2019re being hateful FUD* when I start exploring AMC and Adam Aron. I\u2019m not. I held AMC until last week and I hope you all get very rich riding these pumps if you\u2019re still holding AMC. I also hope you escape the impact of the incoming dumps that I suspect will happen and then buy a metric shit ton of GameStop. And that\u2019s not investment advice. I\u2019m just a MOASS ape and I\u2019m very hopeful.\n\nSomething else I\u2019ll clear up before it gets muddy\u2026 **this post gives a very strong date indication at the end. But I\u2019m not projecting a MOASS date. There can only be one Apestradamus.** However, I do think there\u2019s a strong rocket possibility this week. But it will always be standard casino advice that it\u2019s not a good idea to buy options for earnings week when IV is high because of IV crush. Why is that advice still valid in this non standard casino GameStop gambling event? A serious truth remains: the naked short hedges and their bagholding bank friends aren\u2019t bankrupt enough to be crying for bailouts from taxpayers yet, so the GameStop forecast is still Clear Moonshot with a certainty of fuckery and a chance of flash crash and/or MOASS next week, and we might go up or down or both or go sideways this week, I'm pretty sure. And there\u2019s a simple way I\u2019m escaping the earning week options uncertainty and [giving DFV a really great birthday present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Gill) on his way to [the shareholder meeting in Grapevine](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400965591800762368?s=20) on the 9th: I\u2019m just going to keep buying and hodling GameStop because I like it so much, you filthy and beautiful FUD crushing apes.\n\nLet\u2019s go.\n\n**MANIPULATING THE MEME STOCK NARRATIVE**\n\nI was debating spending my weekend writing this post until I saw [an article on MarketWatch titled \u201cInteractive Brokers founder says **problem with AMC Entertainment memes**: People\u2026 will lose a very substantial amount of money](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interactive-brokers-founder-says-problem-with-amc-entertainment-memes-peoplewill-lose-a-very-substantial-amount-of-money-11622836260) being directed at our subreddit. I made part of the title bold in my link because it\u2019s a FUD fulcrum point. Why? The Interactive Broker founder is Thomas Peterffy, a Citadel\u2019s PFOF client, and I think he\u2019s playing his part in the hedge fund game with the meme stock narrative. I also think the aim of this game is to point blame at our memes for the losses retail bagholders will experience at the end of an orchestrated meme stock (outside of GameStop) pump and dump. This FUD is a blame shifting mechanism. How? If what we\u2019re witnessing with AMC, etc, is a massive pump and dump, the hedge funds, brokers, and bankers are the perpetrators, not the people who\u2019ve been memeing about their crimes. And this article is definitely feigned worry about retail losses, not hedge fund losses. How do we know that? From the article:\n\n>The market veteran [Peterffy] told MarketWatch in a Friday interview that the big problem with the so-called \u201cmeme\u201dstock revolution, with assets powered higher on social-media sentiment and not on fundamentals, is that novice investors will be saddled with real losses when stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings AMC, -6.68% and GameStop Corp. GME, -3.80%, eventually come back down to Earth.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack in that paragraph alone, so let\u2019s lightly touch four observations (I\u2019ll be dedicating a separate post to the meme stock narrative manipulation) to set the stage for the rest of this post and series to follow. \n\nFirst, [MarketWatch is part of Citadel\u2019s CME media arm](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/msuj3g/guess_who_is_also_with_citadel_marketwatch_do_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Citadel is a primary perpetrator of the market wide naked shorting and FTD scandal as it relates to GameStop](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mn0q9q/theory_all_the_pieces_pt_1_the_anatomy_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). That makes this article on MarketWatch a conflict of interest. How? Citadel holds short positions that GME price action has defied and they\u2019re presenting a market authority figure they do business with on their media subsidiary to project downhill price action into Citadel\u2019s short positions that will coincide with retail investor losses. That alone is a manipulation of market sentiment. When you combine the media ownership conflict with the media owner\u2019s market positions, there\u2019s a case to be made that it\u2019s criminal market manipulation in practice.\n\nSecond, Peterffy\u2019s brokerage, Interactive Brokers, is a Citadel [payment for order flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp) client. That makes his opinion on GameStop his own conflict of interest considering he knows what short hedges yoloed into MOASS. Here\u2019s an [excellent article called \u201cHow Much Does Free Cost?\u201d](https://www.elevatecapitaladvisors.com/news/20191007) that mentions the Citadel/IBKR PFOF relationship; the author states:\n\n>On Thursday, September 26 Interactive Brokers ... announced a new type of account agreement for smaller investors called \u201cIBKR Lite\u201d which provides unlimited commission-free trades on US exchange-listed stocks and ETFs. In **a radical departure** from historical operating procedure **Interactive Brokers (IB) would pay for this service by selling the trade order flow to execution services like Citadel and Virtu**. \n\nTo return to a foundational moment for apes, here\u2019s [Peterffy\u2019s community famous interview on CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/17/interactive-brokers-thomas-peterffy-on-gamestop-hearing.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard) where he talks about broker obligation to go to market to buy shares, which would have pushed GameStop stock prices into the thousands without the buy-button removal manipulation we experienced in January. Notice in retrospect, though some still praise him for being honest, Peterffy avoids calling complicity on the practice of naked short selling and the interview concludes with him brushing off his inclusion in the PFOF scheme that disadvantages retail investors. Say it again. CONFLICT OF INTEREST.\n\nThird, there\u2019s a pairing of AMC and GameStop in the presented narrative that labels them both meme stocks, an equalization that I think reveals an intent to co-opt and steal GameStop positive sentiment and attach it to AMC. This effort has been thorough and predictive. For instance, we saw articles like [this CCN business GameStop hit piece in March](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/25/investing/gamestop-amc-meme-stocks/index.html) that asserts \u201cGamstop tumbled 33% following its miserable earning report\u201d before offering \u201c[a]lthough it highlighted a few bright spots, including exploding digital growth, overall sales and profit fell short of Wall Street expectations.\u201d Notice the two false characterizations? First, the earnings report wasn\u2019t miserable; it was solid and spoke to positive indicators in the first steps of a company transition still in its infancy. Second, Wall Street bet on GameStop bankruptcy. That means earnings absolutely defied and exceeded their company profit expectations and stomped on the projection of their short hedge bankruptcy bet. Then we see articles hitting the news cycle this week [that call AMC the new king of meme stocks](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-king-meme-stocks-3-173642798.html), asserting:\n\n>The surge has topped 390% in the last two weeks alone, pushing AMC\u2019s stock price to a record high. **Its market capitalization has also ballooned to $31 billion, surpassing other so-called meme stocks. That includes GameStop Corp.**, which now sits at about $21 billion after reaching a high of $25 billion in January.\n\nI\u2019ll dive deeper into this intentional narratorial pairing of AMC and GameStop as a psychological strategy in a subsequent post. To me, it\u2019s both an incredible GameStop bullish indicator and a serious AMC warning. However, it also indicates that serious fraud is still being aimed at us with the idea that it could be successful.\n\nFourth, the article tries to drive home the idea of meme stocks being indicative of a revolution, and they are. However, context becomes paramount in this discussion because the MarketWatch article characterizes the meme stock revolution in a manner that\u2019s dangerous to the revolutionaries while the author avoids mentioning the hedge fund crimes that made GameStop MOASS possible in the first place; here\u2019s the characterization:\n\n>The investments in AMC and GameStop originally started out as **organized short-squeezes by a clutch of individual investors** who had identified that a number of companies were heavily shorted by hedge funds and surmised, correctly, that those stocks could be pressured higher if enough buyers collectively swooped in.\n\nThat \u201corganization\u201d word. It\u2019s really close to organic, which is the type of community we are, but it\u2019s very important that we remember that [Wall Street would love to regulate us out of the market in our current form](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reddit-traders-gamestop-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-laws-regulator-esma-gme-2021-2-1030093197) and massive retail losses in a pump and dump they organize could be used as a regulatory excuse to fuck us. And that \u201corganization\u201d word and its importance\u2026 from the article:\n\n>\"Discussing the opportunity to buy or sell shares of an issuer does not constitute market abuse,\" the EU's top market regulator said in a statement. \"However, **organizing or executing coordinated strategies** to trade or place orders at certain conditions and times to move a share's price could constitute market manipulation.\"\n\nTo me, that makes Peterffy\u2019s MarketWatch interview a potential indication of hedgie plans. And, in case you\u2019re an \u201cSEC will save us\u201d ape, here\u2019s what I wrote on Friday about [Citadel hiring the ex-SEC director, Stephen Luparello, to be general counsel and now Chief Legal of the crime empire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nsoiq7/i_just_found_out_citadel_hired_exsec_director/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Have you heard of [regulatory capture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp)? Please get familiar with the term. Here\u2019s an article called [\u201cWhen watchdogs become pets - or the problem of regulatory capture](https://theconversation.com/vital-signs-when-watchdogs-become-pets-or-the-problem-of-regulatory-capture-111170) that offers a good insight for what we are to Wall Street; here, the author states:\n\n>Self-interested politicians supply regulation. Firms demand it \u2013 usually because they want a competitor regulated.\n\nWhy is that important to apes?\n\nSimple.\n\nWe\u2019re the competition Wall Street wants to regulate.\n\nBut how do you get to a point of regulating the apes?\n\nAgain, simple.\n\nYou make the general public think that regulations that will fuck apes are a good idea by fucking everyone with a pump and dump you orchestrate with your continued abuse and avoidance of regulations while spinning your crimes to your benefit with the media outlets you own. Those big brain plays. \n\nBut how do we know this meme stock short squeeze narrative is media FUD driving to a conclusion that points away from GameStop? Let\u2019s look at how the GameStop and AMC capital raises were treated.\n\nThe Street wasn\u2019t a fan of GameStop selling shares as evidenced in an article titled [GameStop plunges on plans to sell 3.5 million shares](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/gamestop-gme-stock-share-offering-sales). Plunges\u2026 this article mentions GameStop and AMC. However, the characterization of GameStop\u2019s capital raise fails to give clear indication of a newly debt free company (we\u2019ll get to how important that is in this post - it\u2019s actually incredible) with unencumbered liquid cash to work with. Here, the author writes:\n\n>GameStop said it plans to sell the shares through an \u201cat-the-market\u201d equity offering program. It said it intends to use the net proceeds to \u201cfurther accelerate its transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening its balance sheet.\u201d\n\nThen the author enters the AMC FUD zone. Here the author writes:\n\n>AMC founder and CEO Adam Aron told TheStreet's Jim Cramer last week that his company has been able to navigate its way through the coronavirus pandemic by raising $2.8 billion in cash, thanks in large part to the rally in its share price despite being close to going out of business \"five different times last year.\"\n\n>AMC in late January said **it raised $917 million in debt and equity** that it said not only takes bankruptcy \"completely off the table\" but also put it in position to pay down debts accumulated during the pandemic and beef up its coffers.\n\n>Both GameStop and AMC have become the mascot of retail.\n\nTwo retail mascots, two different characterizations of company capital raises by retail antagonistic media though, and a serious deception. Remember \"debt and equity\" for when we get to the deception. First though, MarketWatch pumped this article titled [\u201cWhat dilution?: AMC can\u2019t stop raising capital by selling more of its meme stock and the market can\u2019t stop buying](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-dilution-amc-cant-stop-raising-capital-by-selling-more-of-its-meme-stock-and-the-market-cant-stop-buying-11622568761). This article is a trip all by itself. It references obvious share dilution in AMC, talks positively about AMC\u2019s growth plan, and even discusses an existential crisis faced by Redditors seeing Mudrick Capital rip and flip a private AMC share offering. To the existential crisis, the article brings up Mudrick Capital, quoting Redditors, and even going so far as to quote someone calling Jason Mudrick an \u201cape\u201d for being long GME and AMC; the author writes:\n\n>On Reddit, where retail traders have been singing the praises of AMC for months, users applauded Aron\u2019s thinking even while coming to grips with the notion that a meme stock was gaining thanks to a deal with a hedge fund, widely-viewed as the existential enemy of the retail investor after January\u2019s short squeeze.\n\nThe article then concludes by quoting [Adam Aron in defence of share dilution he promised shareholders he would avoid just six weeks earlier](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amc-stock-price-ceo-says-no-stock-sales-new-issuance-2021-4-1030310408):\n\n>Still, numerous AMC message boards were filled with users questioning why Aron, referred to as \u201cAA\u201d would execute another capital raise and risk diluting the stock price by trusting a hedge fund with a large tranche of shares.\n\n>But Aron\u2019s most vocal defender was himself.\n\n>\u201cIn our view, this is not mindless dilution, but rather this is very smart raising of cash so that we can grow this company,\u201d Aron tweeted. \u201cTo many of you on Twitter, to grow YOUR company. Watch out naysayers, $AMC is going to play on offense again. Here we come!\u201d\n\nA very smart raising of cash because share dilution is a positive with AMC, right? Here\u2019s [another article that has a fascinating take that glosses over share dilution and tries to subtly paint GameStop as bad for the markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/amc-says-it-has-already-completed-share-offering-raises-587-million.html). Again, we have it driven home that AMC is retail driven. The article states:\n\n>In a curious move typical of the meme stocks, the shares rallied off their lows on news of the completed sale as retail investors cheered the capital raised and looked past the dilution of their stakes.\n\nThen the author doubles down on this narrative:\n\n>AMC, the star of the show in Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum, has soared more than 140% this week alone as retail traders continued to encourage each other to pile into the speculative name. The shares have skyrocketed more than 2,900% this year.\n\nAnd the implication in making this point? AMC is the safe squeeze that\u2019s happening unlike the unsafe GameStop squeeze that already happened. And Wall Street agrees about this:\n\n>While AMC\u2019s latest surge is reminiscent of the GameStop mania earlier this year, many on Wall Street believe [the movie theater chain won\u2019t cause a turmoil in the overall market like GameStop did](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/unlike-the-gamestop-bubble-amcs-retail-trading-frenzy-doesnt-pose-the-same-systemic-market-risk.html). Back in January, GameStop\u2019s short squeeze caused liquidity headaches at hedge funds and brokerage firms that spiked volatility in the broader market and raised concerns about financial stability.\n\nAnd the article CNBC embedded in that paragraph? Here\u2019s what the author had to say about GameStop:\n\n>The wild trading in AMC Entertainment is giving investors flashbacks of the GameStop saga earlier this year that blew up hedge funds and caused turmoil on Wall Street. However, the recent frenzy doesn\u2019t appear to have the same force behind it and likely won\u2019t trigger the same ripple effects.\n\n>So far, there have been no signs of liquidity issues at any hedge fund or brokerage firm amid the massive rally in AMC driven by **meme-obsessed retail traders**.\n\nThose meme-obsessed retail traders\u2026\n\nToo bad some of us meme junkies believe in the long term value of GameStop [even though media panned GameStop\u2019s planned stock offering as a mixed blessing, unlike AMC, and painted us into everyone else's short squeeze corner](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-planned-stock-offering-is-a-mixed-blessing-51617647607); here the article writer quotes an analyst with a $30 GameStop target:\n\n>Feldman wrote, \u201c[GameStop] has yet to show financial success in an industry that is rapidly shifting to digital. And, we continue to believe the current valuation far exceeds our rosy fundamental expectations and projected multiyear benefits from the strategic transformation.\u201d\n\nBut remember GameStop\u2019s \u201cmiserable earning report\u201d while market media glosses over \u201cexploding digital growth\u201d? Good. Think of AMC when this author offers this gem:\n\n>The stock sale news is mixed for GameStop. Existing shareholders may reconsider the stock\u2019s current valuation and expected dilution, **especially as short sellers are provided easier opportunities to cover their bearish bets.** But the fresh capital is sure to boost Cohen\u2019s strategic vision.\n\nSo what is it? Are capital raises good or bad? And for who? One implication of dilution is that more shares mean more opportunities for short hedges to cover their shorts. Regardless, determination of \u201cgood or bad\u201d by the media seems to depend on which side of the bet the hedge fund that owns the media company is on.\n\nI\u2019ll conclude with this article where Yahoo provides some important information while [discussing Mudrick and the AMC share dillution](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/amc-surges-meme-stocks-start-103054396.html), a key to understanding another depth of this saga and why the media is making such effort to obscure perspectives of AMC and GameStop. First, the article creates a negative connotation about video games; the author writes:\n\n>The move by Mudrick Capital Management to flip 8.5 million shares of the movie theater chain immediately after buying them in a private placement from the company shows how Wall Street is getting bolder about making a quick buck off a trading frenzy that has helped fuel big rallies in several stocks favored by retail investors.\n\n>**Easy money from the Federal Reserve has \"created an almost video game-like atmosphere in the stock market and investing,\"** said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading. \"There's money flowing everywhere and this is a great illustration of that.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll get to the Fed in a subsequent post too. Here though, we get to an immediate key to unraveling the AMC situation; the articles offers:\n\n>Jason Mudrick founded London and New York-based Mudrick Capital in 2009 after leaving investment firm Contrarian Capital Management, **where he had focused on distressed investing for eight years**, according to the hedge fund's website.\n\nDebt investment... if you know about [vulture funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vulturefund.asp) you probably already see the vultures circling AMC, and you understand RC\u2019s Sears tweet. You also know what happened to Toys-R-Us. But stay tuned regardless because this exploration gets a bit mind bending. So let\u2019s wash our minds of the media FUD we just explored [because GameStop has always been a long term value play with the possibility of MOASS](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/former-chewy-ceo-ryan-cohen-urges-gamestop-to-become-the-amazon-of-video-games.html) despite GameStop and GameStop investors getting co-opted into the meme stock narrative.\n\nAnd breathe.\n\nNow that your mind is clear because you\u2019ve remembered that RC is paving a debt free path to building GameStop into the Amazon of the video game industry, remember that [DFV tweeted a scene from the movie \u201cParasite\u201d](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400157768170889221?s=20) - parasites we\u2019re going to attempt to identify.\n\nYou might feel dirty as we go further, but don\u2019t worry, [we\u2019re still pushing GameStop bears off the wall like this girl](https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/have-you-seen/2021/06/01/teenage-girl-fights-off-huge-bear-protect-her-dogs/7496469002/), you bunch of girls.\n\nRC VERSUS THE VULTURE FUNDS\n\n[RC tweeted a picture of a Sears sign](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1400492465442811904?s=20) being torn down on June 3rd, 2021. \n\nHow many of you remember Sears? I do and I hated it. My Mom-ape would drag me there while she shopped for a vacuum or new washing machine. We never got either. I wished Sears would disappear. Then I remember [watching the local Sears get shuttered as an adult](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-sears-bankruptcy-store-closings). I didn\u2019t realize until this week that my Mom-ape couldn\u2019t afford a new vacuum and Sears disappeared because Mom-ape and Sears shared a vulture fund problem.\n\nHere\u2019s a synopsis of [what a vulture fund is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_fund) from the first paragraph of the wiki:\n\n>A vulture fund is a hedge fund, private-equity fund or distressed debt fund, that invests in debt considered to be very weak or in default, known as distressed securities. Investors in the fund profit by buying debt at a discounted price on a secondary market and then using numerous methods to subsequently sell the debt for a larger amount than the purchasing price. Debtors include companies, countries, and individuals.\n\nWhat does that mean? It means that a company considered to be on the brink of failure or in a bottleneck situation where it needs access to credit to remain viable is vulnerable to getting picked apart by debt investors, kind of like how vultures start circling a distressed animal when it becomes apparent that the animal might die. For example, [our other favorite store Toys-R-Us got picked apart](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/toys-r-us-creditors-sue-former-bain-capital-kkr-execs) by Bain Capital, a [Mitt Romney founded vulture fund that gets described here in Rolling Stone in conjunction with Romney\u2019s 2012 Presidential campaign](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/why-private-equity-firms-like-bain-really-are-the-worst-of-capitalism-241519/); this article gives a great description of a debt investment strategy known as a **leveraged buyout**:\n\n>Here\u2019s what private equity is really about: A firm like Bain obtains cheap credit and uses it to acquire a company in a \u201cleveraged buyout.\u201d \u201cLeverage\u201d refers to the fact that the company being purchased is forced to pay for about 70 percent of its own acquisition, by taking out loans. **If this sounds like an odd arrangement, that\u2019s because it is. Imagine a homebuyer purchasing a house **and making the bank responsible for repaying its own loan*, and you start to get the picture.**\n\n>O.K., **but what about this much more virtuous business of swooping in and restoring struggling companies to financial health? Well, that\u2019s not a large part of what private equity firms do, either. In fact, they more typically target profitable, slow-growth market leaders.** (Private equity firms presently own companies employing one of every 10 U.S. workers, or 10 million people.)\n\n>And that\u2019s when the fun starts. **Once the buyout is completed, the private equity guys start swinging the meat axe, aggressively cutting costs wherever they can** \u2013 so that the company can start paying off its new debt \u2013 by laying off workers and cutting capital costs. This process often boosts operating profit without a significant hit to the business, but only in the short term; **in the long run, the austerity approach makes it difficult for companies to stay competitive, not least because money that would otherwise have been invested in expansion or product development \u2013 which might increase revenue down the line \u2013 is used to pay off the company\u2019s debt.**\n\nAnd here\u2019s the kicker; not only do these vulture funds destroy companies that ape families and communities rely on, whether or not these companies are viable, they get tax breaks for doing it. That means vulture funds effectively screw apes twice, not to mention how this insider practice interrupts market realities for retail investors to the advantage and profit of Wall Street scammers gaming the system. Again from the article:\n\n>leveraged buyouts ... also short-change taxpayers, via a giant loophole in the tax code that enables companies to deduct loan interest from taxes. The provision was originally intended to encourage borrowing to build new factories, not to finance leveraged buyouts. But ... private equity-owned companies paid a 22 percent tax rate before being bought, and only 10 percent the year after being acquired. That adds up to a savings of $130 billion in taxes since 2000.\n\nAnd how does what I just wrote relate to RC\u2019s Sears tweet? Here\u2019s an article titled [\u201cIt Was Vulture Capitalism that Killed Sears\u201d](https://prospect.org/economy/vulture-capitalism-killed-sears/) and subtitled <i>Don\u2019t blame Amazon or the internet. It was a predatory hedge fund.</i> And who was the vulture fund that destroyed Sears? From the article:\n\n>In the case of Sears, the culprit is a hedge-fund operator named Edward Lampert, once a senior merger guy at **Goldman Sachs**.\n\nSo... Edward Lampert entered into vulture capitalism from the same Goldman Sachs that has a substantial short position in the GameStop bankruptcy bet. The same Goldman Sachs that helps short hedges indefinitely FTD on their short borrows. And why? Here\u2019s a big chunk of the article that tells how profitable it can be to kill a company by encumbering it with debt you control:\n\n>In 2005, Lampert merged Sears with Kmart, loaded both up with debt, and used some of the debt on stock buybacks to pump up the share price and enrich shareholders, notably himself and his hedge fund. \n\n>The Sears story shows how hedge fund operators can thrive even as the underlying company is pillaged. In a decade, 175,000 people at Sears/Kmart lost their jobs and revenue was cut in half. Various pieces of Sears were sold off. Lampert did just fine.\n\n>His net worth soared to over $8 billion after he did the Sears deal. In some years, he made over $1 billion just in income. After ballooning by several billion in the years when Sears stock was high-flying, Lampert's reported net worth is back down to something like $2 billion\u2014below its peak but still astronomical and all based on taking down one of America's great companies. \n\n>Lampert's hedge fund also became a prime lender to Sears, making money off of commissions and interest charges as well as being a prime shareholder. Lampert's core strategy was to enrich himself, even if he ran Sears into the ground. For the most part, the nostalgia coverage of the demise of Sears has missed this.\n\nWow, eh? \n\nSomething that must be understood about this debt investment practice is how well it pairs with predatory naked short selling. How does it relate? The debt investment \u201ccapital boost\u201d pumps sentiment and stock price on the distressed asset, then the corporate raider austerity measures kick in, the targeted company begins to struggle, and bear raiders start their work mirroring the intentionally created downward stock price action through short hedge investment pressure and media FUD that tarnishes investor sentiment about the company. The point: it\u2019s easier to guarantee unbelievable personal profit guiding a company into failure than it is to risk guiding it into a corporate turnaround and transformation like RC has put forward with GameStop. However, it\u2019s tricky to guide a company into failure while pretending you\u2019re trying to increase its value. To that point, here\u2019s [another Prospect article, this one a dive into naked shorting and FTDs as they relate to GameStop](https://prospect.org/power/gamestop-mess-exposes-the-naked-short-selling-scam/) that pairs well with [u/atobitt\u2019s HOC DDs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvk5dv/a_house_of_cards_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and points to Goldman Sachs as a serious culprit in the scam like u/atobitt and [Lucy Komisar in her first r/SuperStonk AMA](https://youtu.be/wKXWvEpnN34). From the Prospect article:\n\n>Citadel, as a market maker that has to accept all buys and sells, gets a pass on many naked short selling rules. Even then ... in 2020, Citadel violated the Security Commission\u2019s Reg SHO, the rule regulating short sales. On November 13, 2020, FINRA, the traders\u2019 self-regulator, fined Citadel Securities $180,000 for failing to mark 6.5 million equity trades as short sales between September 14, 2015, and July 21, 2016. Citadel did not admit or deny the allegations but paid the fine.\n\n>The problem is not new. **The SEC and New York Stock Exchange fined Goldman Sachs an infinitesimal $2 million in 2007 for allowing customers for more than two years to use its automated direct market access system and automatically mark short orders as long.**\n\n>Beyond that, the SEC rule itself is so weak, **traders can roll over naked shorts and stay naked indefinitely.**\n\nHere\u2019s another ape post about this FTD scam from a smooth brained beauty named u/nequin about there being nearly [$1B of FTDs on May 14th, 2021 between GME and associated ETFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrpjle/almost_1b_ftd_on_may_14th_between_gme_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). On May 14th, 2021. Oh boy that cheeky retail that loves popcorn so much...\n\nRemember Mudrick Capital ripping and flipping a private AMC share offering? Something obviously doesn\u2019t add up. But what?\n\nFirst, I think it needs to be understood that much of AMC\u2019s company capital raise is a debt investment, corporate raiders circling the carcass that\u2019s circling other theater company carcasses with it\u2019s debt encumbrance masquerading as a capital infusion in tandem with the share dilution. We then have media flogging AMC as a Reddit frenzy. Such a frenzy in fact that the media is [projecting the AMC stock price blasted up through a trading halt because of free popcorn](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57334263) and, in case you forget, this article pairs their obviously justifiable caution of AMC investment with GameStop investment; the author states: \n\n>[AMC] promised to give free popcorn to smaller investors.\n\n>Analysts have said that so-called \"meme\" stocks, such as **AMC and GameStop, should be approached with caution.**\n\n>It is the latest example of amateur investors trying to seize power from Wall Street giants.\n\nThe article then doubles down on this assertion and implication of market manipulation by retail investors:\n\n>But [Wall Street has] faced losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites like Reddit or Twitter, drove prices up.\n\nIt then offers an appeal to authority:\n\n>\"The party could go on as long as investors continue co-acting,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote. \"The problem is, the higher the price goes, the higher is the temptation to take profit and walk away.\"\n\nNow, let\u2019s pair that assertion with the oddity of [AMC warning retail investors not to buy in despite it offering shares that Mudrick gobbled up and spat out like a whore bear](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/03/amc-meme-stock-trading-suspended/). Just absorb this piece of information reported June 3rd, 2021:\n\n>In a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, [AMC] highlighted the extreme price fluctuations of its stock and the stark disconnect between the passions of retail investors and its actual operations.\n\n>\u201cWe believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last,\u201d AMC said in the filing. \u201cUnder the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.\u201d\n\n>The company went on to list several risks to investors, including rapid and substantial price spikes and falls; the fickle sentiment of online trading communities; share prices that diverge from the company\u2019s financial performance; and the market dynamics of a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\n\nBut what about the naughty words Melissa Lee said? What about predatory short funds and their vulture pals and the risks they pose to investors? No mention. But we do get the pairing of AMC with GameStop while demonizing retail investors:\n\n>AMC\u2019s whipsaw is being propelled by retail investors \u2014 many active on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum \u2014 mirroring the trading mania that swept through markets earlier this year alongside GameStop and other companies that institutional investors had bet against. And its rise is just as untethered from financial performance.\n\nAnd what\u2019s the take away we\u2019re supposed to believe?\n\nHere\u2019s the setup: [Wall Street are the experts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/08/gamestop-wallstreet-wealth/), it\u2019s [apes that are the problem for market stability and regulators](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/03/gamestop-sec-regulation/), and [Adam Aron is *Silverback*, the most retail friendly of CEOs, and we\u2019re not listening to his company when they say \u201cdon\u2019t buy\u201d... even though media is also pumping him as the retail hero apes call AA](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-amc-ceo-adam-aron-embraced-the-company-meme-status-2021-6-1030496427).\n\nAnd what\u2019s the likely purpose of creating this FUD narrative?\n\n**AMC is on the official SEC record warning retail that they shouldn\u2019t invest in AMC, media is branding AMC price action as detached from reality because of a frenzied retail coup, they\u2019re laying what\u2019s likely a hedge fund orchestrated pump and dump at the feet of retail investors, and AMC fomo retail investors that get crushed by the dump (or pretend to be) are a perfect scapegoat to justify regulating our community instead of hedge funds.** Remember when we memed popcorn at the hedgies? Guess what? These are fickle pricks (we\u2019ll explore that in a subsequence post I might call \u201cUpset hedgie titty slap battles\u201d) and they\u2019re mocking us with free popcorn in exchange for the AMC shares we\u2019re stupid enough to buy.\n\nAnd what\u2019s the point of bringing up vulture funds?\n\nThe same vulture fund tried to buy GameStop and AMC.\n\nWhy is that interesting?\n\nBecause Adam Aron has deep ties to that vulture fund.\n\nWhy else?\n\nRC tweeted about a company that, like GameStop, was getting victimized by an obvious vulture fund pump and dump scheme.\n\nAnd riddle me this\u2026 AMC is a distressed asset likely being raided, [Adam Aron is raving about AMC\u2019s new investors that are at odds with Wall Street](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html), he went back on his promise to shareholders about share dilution while media spun the share offering positively, and AMC\u2019s official SEC filing is a stated warning to investors that they\u2019re probably going to get crushed.\n\nHmm.\n\nI detect corporate and media complicity in a Wall Street scam.\n\nI also [detect that RC likely refused to play ball with the vulture funds](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1399526466770059268?s=20).\n\nRegardless, welcome to the debt investment game, apes.\n\nGOTS, part 1.1\n\n[GOTS, part 1.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nuud15/gods_of_the_sun_part_12_manipulating_the_meme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[GOTS, part 1.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nv333e/gods_of_the_sun_part_13_manipulating_the_meme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",
