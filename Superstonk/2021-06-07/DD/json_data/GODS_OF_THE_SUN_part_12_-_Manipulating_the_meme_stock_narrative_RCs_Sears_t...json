Part 1.2 dives deeper into vulture funds and specifically focuses on **Apollo Global Management, a vulture fund founded by Leon Black, the Apollo founding CEO who stepped down as CEO and from the board for paying Jeffrey Epstein $158 million dollars.** Why is that relevant to our favorite stock? Apollo Global tried to orchestrate a leveraged buyout of GameStop in 2019. It also attempted a leveraged buyout of AMC in December 2020. **And Adam Aron? He's been with Leon Black and Apollo for 30 years and was an Apollo Global vulture fund Senior Partner when Apollo sold AMC to Chinese vulture fund, Wanda Group.**\n\n**This post also sets the stage for an exploration of why a company's senior note debt is as important to future company projections as its ability to control the dilution of its shares when attempting to maintain shareholder value. This discussion aims to shed light on the importance of RC paying off GameStop's outstanding senior note debt,** though market media has attempted to thoroughly obscure how important that event was in the meme stock narrative, and why.\n\nAnd thanks to everyone who took the time to read GOTS 1.1 and leave comments and point deeper down rabbit trails. Please continue. Apes together strong.\n\nLet's go. \n\n**ENTER APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT**\n\nApollo Global Management is a predatory vulture fund that has a long history with AMC. Here's an article that paints a clear picture of [Apollo entering the AMC bankruptcy sweepstakes written by Mark Hake for investorplace.com](https://investorplace.com/2021/01/cash-infusion-amc-stock-fighting-chance/) before price action in January; here\u2019s a big chunk of Hake\u2019s article:\n\n>One more piece of news to factor in is that The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 6 that **AMC was trying to leverage the assets of its U.K. Odeon cinema group.** The article said AMC was seeking 300 million GBP (about $408 million before expenses) in **new credit facilities from Apollo Global Management** (NYSE:APO).\n\n>**Typically in these kinds of deals, the private equity funds providing the capital have horrendous fees, large amounts of warrants and odious covenants, collateral, hurdles and maintenance ratios.** On top of that **AMC will have to prove to its investment committee they can produce enough cash flow to cover their interest charges and stay out of bankruptcy. In fact, I have seen situations where the hedge fund / private equity fund provided the debt capital to a struggling but valuable company even when it knew the company couldn\u2019t handle the debt. It fully expected bankruptcy.**\n\n>But **being the most recent capital provider it can supersede other debt investors.** It can obtain the rights to the collateral. **Either that or it knew it would have a controlling stake in the company simply from a large amount of debt provided.**\n\n>**I can envision a situation like this where Apollo Capital wants to be the biggest stick at the bankruptcy table. To get there, it has to provide the most recent pre-bankruptcy capital.**\n\nIn other words, Apollo Global Management would like to saddle AMC with debt that gets portrayed as capital in order to take profit from the company going bankrupt, which is still expected, the epitome of the parasitic corporate raider ethos. Only this time they\u2019re able to milk retail investors they can rug pull at any time with share dilution they portray positively in the media. Again, encumber the company, distress the company into a survival struggle or capitalize on a naturally occurring survival struggle, pump the price as high as you can, take as much money as you can, let the bear raiders circle, then crush the price into the profit windows of the short hedges while you bankrupt the company. Easy. \n\nTo reiterate the points above, Apollo Global [tried to buy AMC in December 2020 through a leveraged buyout](https://nypost.com/2020/12/11/apollo-circling-amc-as-chain-scrambles-to-stay-afloat-sources/); from the article:\n\n>AMC Entertainment is being circled by a trio of investment firms including Apollo Global Management as the movie-theater chain scrambles to stay afloat amid the pandemic, The Post has learned.\n\n>**Apollo, which along with Canyon Capital Advisors and Davidson Kempner Capital Management are holders of AMC\u2019s first-lien debt, are urging the company to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy** and have offered $1 billion in debtor-in-possession financing, according to sources close to the situation.\n\nBeing circled by predatory vultures...\n\nApollo Global [also tried to perform a leveraged buyout of Gamestop in 2019](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-and-the-art-of-the-non-deal-11548779069); from the article:\n\n>GameStop said Tuesday that it has ended its efforts to find a buyer. In its filing, **the video game retail chain blamed the decision on \u201clack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer.\u201d** The Wall Street Journal had previously reported the company was talking with private-equity firms Sycamore Partners and **Apollo Global Management LLC** about a potential deal.\n\n>Put another way: Financial backers weren\u2019t exactly lining up to take on a retailer whose core business\u2014selling new and used game disks\u2014is slowly vanishing thanks to the rise of digital downloads. \n\nSomething fascinating to me has been looking at how the media drove sentiment about GameStop at this time when vulture funds were seeking to enter it into a bankruptcy path, a time we know also coincides with bear raiders like Melvin already shorting GameStop into the abyss. For instance, let's look at [the article titled \u201cGameStop ends search for a buyer, shares plunge](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-ends-search-for-a-buyer-shares-plunge-11548771564?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1) again. Just focus on the title. What\u2019s the connotation? GameStop needed a buyer and failing to find one caused a massive stock price fall. But what\u2019s the reality? GameStop sidestepped a leveraged buyout with likely horrendous terms that would have massively hampered the company\u2019s effort to move forward. How do we know that? GameStop\u2019s statement also recorded in the article: \n\n>\u201cGameStop\u2019s Board has now terminated efforts to pursue a sale of the company due to the lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn other words, GameStop avoided financing on terms acceptable to a vulture fund buyer, those terms realistically a guaranteed bankruptcy bid while predatory short hedges were already coordinating a GameStop bankruptcy yolo and hammering GameStop through their media channels. And how did GameStop avoid this fate? It\u2019s also in the article. The sale of Spring Mobile. However, this cash influx gets framed as a company problem by referring the sudden cash influx back into the need for a buyer; to this aim, the author writes:\n\n>As part of its strategic review, GameStop reached a deal in November to sell its Spring Mobile business to Prime Communications LP. The sale of nearly 1,300 wireless phone stores closed earlier this month, netting GameStop roughly $735 million in cash.\n\n>The company said Tuesday it is still determining how best to use the proceeds, including reducing debt, buying back stock or reinvesting in the business.\n\n>**Without a sale, GameStop\u2019s future remains uncertain** as its options range from becoming more active in esports, competitive video game contests, to focusing on how it can diversify revenue at its existing stores.\n\nHere\u2019s [another article from this time period that really drives the point home that GameStop was on the brink of failure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-videogame-market-shifts-gamestop-struggles-to-boost-sales-11546561467?mod=article_inline), a definitive manipulation of investor sentiment. The article asserts:\n\n>\u201cGameStop has become irrelevant in the video game market,\u201d said Mike Hickey, an analyst at BenchMark, in a research note.\n\nAnd:\n\n>\u201cTheir strength is in their loyal customer,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said. \u201cThey are in a challenging spot, but they have, for now, retained the vast majority of their customers. That window is not going to be open forever.\u201d\n\nTo step into GameStop bullish mode for a moment, it sure seems like we\u2019ve overcome the reasons to be a GameStop bear. I also hope it\u2019s starting to work through you how coordinated the manipulation of the stock market has become because a few bad people developed a profit model that considers driving companies toward bankruptcy good risk management. Just remember this statement: *\"I can envision a situation like this where Apollo Capital wants to be the biggest stick at the bankruptcy table. To get there, it has to provide the most recent pre-bankruptcy capital.\"* I also hope you\u2019re realizing that debt notes are important to a company\u2019s future, just like the potential use of its shares to raise capital.\n\nAnd I said the \u201cbad people\u201d word\u2026 but surely Apollo Global aren\u2019t bad people, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nBeets, bears, Battlestar Galactica. \n\nWe\u2019re about to get really dirty together.\n\nSo [here\u2019s RC dunk tweeting on Jim Cramer to get you through it](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1336775515101949963?s=20).\n\nOr just [take in this beautiful shitpost by u/cui-ui](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nrkjle/rc_tweet_easter_egg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and buy more GameStop and hold it for your innocence every day and [ev](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/na3akt/all_the_confirmation_bias_i_need_right_here_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)ery night if you like the stock. \n\nSorry apes. Sometimes shit gets dark.\n\n**LEON BLACK, JEFFERY EPSTEIN, AND ADAM ARON**\n\nLeon Black is the co-founder of Apollo Global Management. Just [listen to this horseshit on Bloomberg YouTube in a video titled \u201cWhy Leon Black is the Most Feared Man in Private Equity\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8lMILoFVYk) now that we know what a vulture fund is and how it functions. The reporters skirt the application of the word \u201cruthless\u201d to Apollo and Leon, then refer to \u201cthe magic of Apollo\u201d referencing an insurance scheme. Someone please look into the insurance scheme the reporters talk about that BlackStone and Carlyle Group are also hawking, keeping in mind that Carlyle Group is the vulture fund that spawned Jerome Powell for us. And [here\u2019s the article about Leon Black from Bloomberg that led to the Bloomberg YouTube discussion titled \u201cNobody Makes Money Like Apollo\u2019s Ruthless Founder, Leon Black\u201d](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-01-16/nobody-makes-money-like-apollo-s-ruthless-founder-leon-black).\n\nThe man is a financial predator and \u201cpredator\u201d seems like a theme that runs through other facets of his life. For instance, Leon Black got removed as Apollo\u2019s CEO in early 2021 for his deep ties to Jeffrey Epstein, though he still remained on the board until March; this [Financial Times article titled \u201cWhy Did Leon Black Pay $158m to Jeffery Epstein\u201d](https://www.ft.com/content/23448802-3ee8-4c3c-bb46-fc02e304f3ed) gets right into it:\n\n>Mr Black is one of the most successful financiers of his generation, co-founder of Apollo Global Management, a group that ranks among the most powerful on Wall Street. Yet **the billionaire attributes a sizeable part of his family wealth to Epstein, estimating that as much as $2bn in benefits can be traced back to the late paedophile\u2019s financial acumen.** By comparison, Forbes magazine estimated Mr Black was worth $7.7bn at the time of Epstein\u2019s 2019 suicide. \n\n>On Monday, lawyers for Apollo pointed to that professional relationship to explain why its founder had paid $158m to Epstein over a five-year period ending in 2017 during which the disgraced businessman served as Mr Black\u2019s high-priced adviser on issues ranging from audits by the tax authorities, management of his yacht and private plane and a dispute over the ownership of a sculpture by Pablo Picasso. \n\n>**Over two decades, Mr Black confided in Epstein regarding personal matters, leaned on him as an \u201carchitect\u201d of, and \u201cstrict taskmaster\u201d for, the private office that managed his investments. The men socialised or held meetings at Epstein\u2019s Caribbean island** and his other properties in New York, Paris, Florida and New Mexico.\n\nHmm. They went to an island together. I wonder why? But then their relationship deteriorated. And how did it deteriorate? Here\u2019s the characterization that sounds decidedly like being caught up in a honey trap:\n\n>As their relationship deteriorated, **Epstein was not above invoking his friendship with Black in an attempt to extract more money. According to the report by Apollo\u2019s lawyers, he did so \u201cby referencing personal matters that Black had shared with Epstein in confidence\u201d.** Their report added: \u201cThere is no evidence that those matters had any relationship to any of Epstein\u2019s criminal activity or to any of Black\u2019s payments to Epstein.\u201d\n\nBut surely I\u2019m just drawing conclusions, right? Nothing to see here, right? It was just business, right?\n\nI don\u2019t think so, and here\u2019s why.\n\nAn interesting coincidence happened this week while AMC started to pump. What was it? Leon Black reentered the news cycle. Here\u2019s [a Miami Herald investigation into allegations Leon Black sexually assaulted (I'm using that language because the other 'r' word is banned on posts) a woman and paid her hush money while trying to intimidate her into silence](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article251827913.html) that got released [June 1st](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1399727581369409539?s=20); here\u2019s the intro to the article:\n\n>A New York woman has filed a defamation lawsuit against Leon Black, alleging that the hedge fund titan sexually assaulted, harassed and intimidated her, then paid her hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money for more than a decade to keep her from going public.\n\n>Guzel Ganieva, a former model who went on to earn a business degree from Columbia and attended law school, **claims that Black, former CEO of Apollo Global Management, was a \u201cpredator\u201d who \u201cforced sadistic sexual acts on her without her consent,\u201d then demanded she sign a non-disclosure agreement, telling her he would \u201cdestroy her\u201d if she ever told anyone about his conduct,** according to the suit.\n\n>Black, 69, stepped down as Apollo\u2019s chairman and CEO in January, amid revelations that he paid sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein more than $150 million for financial advice.\n\nThat\u2019s as much as I\u2019ll quote from the Miami Herald article at this point. I encourage you to read the article though, but with a SERIOUS TRIGGER WARNING before you do. It gets pretty graphic with what Leon Black is accused of doing to Guzel. It also helps us pivot back into what it looks like when a media company tries to control a narrative. How? Because [Verizon just **sold their media business including Yahoo and AOL to Apollo Global** for $5 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/verizon-sells-yahoo-and-aol-businesses-to-apollo-for-5-billion.html) as reported by the May 3rd article I linked, and we can check out the historical record of how Yahoo has covered Leon Black to see if there\u2019s been a change of tone since the ownership transition.\n\nThe first indication of a FUD campaign on Yahoo is [this article titled \u201cWoman accuses Leon Black of defamation, violent behavior\u201d](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/verizon-sells-yahoo-and-aol-businesses-to-apollo-for-5-billion.html). To start, no. He\u2019s accused of the 'r' ward and years of intimidation, and you can see the extra effort to steer around the \u2018r\u2019 word when the article author phrases an 'r' word allegation as \u201csubjecting her to sexual violence.\u201d And let\u2019s just break down this Apollo media characterization of Guzel and Leon together:\n\n>The complaint said Black subjected Ganieva over several years to numerous instances of unwanted sexual conduct. It referred twice to his alleged \"sexual assaults and r-pes\" of her, and specifically described one alleged ['r' word] from 2014. \n\n>\"Ms. Ganieva's allegations of harassment and other inappropriate behavior are categorically untrue,\" a spokesman for Black said in a statement. \"Mr. Black emphatically denies each and every spurious allegation put forth in this lawsuit and looks forward to disproving them in court.\" \n\n>The spokesman also said Black made \"substantial monetary payments\" to Ganieva based on her threats to go public about their relationship. He did not specify a dollar amount. \n\n>Ganieva said in her complaint that she received unspecified \"regular payments\" from Black for 5-1/2 years after she signed a nondisclosure agreement in October 2015. \n\n>She said Black moved to silence her for his alleged misconduct by coercing her into signing the agreement, **in exchange for forgiving $960,000 of loans he had made and which she could not repay.**\n\nHow this reads to me is Leon used his leveraged buyout vulture capital experience to bend a victim to his will. Why? We know that Guzel is a \u201cformer model who went on to earn a business degree from Columbia and attended law school\u201d from the Miami Herald article. However, this Yahoo article deliberately frames her as \u201ca Russian native now in her late 30s\u201d after contrasting Leon and Guzel\u2019s perspectives of the allegations. What I detect is a subtle/not-so-subtle narrative building device that appeals to the idea that Leon is the victim getting coerced, the psychological hook being that mention of Guzel\u2019s complaint (that has to be mentioned because it\u2019s public) that includes \u201csexual assaults and r---s\u201d is immediately followed by the suggestion statement that \"Ms. Ganieva's allegations of harassment and other inappropriate behavior are categorically untrue.\u201d That hook is couched as a quote that also doubles as an appeal to authority. The appeal to authority functions through a subsequent reference to courtroom action to defend Leon Black from what\u2019s presented to look like an extortion attempt. Again, it reads, \u201cMr. Black emphatically denies each and every spurious allegation put forth in this lawsuit and looks forward to disproving them in court.\u201d But again, Guzel is characterized as just a Russian woman who is making untrue allegations to extort money rather than an immigrant lawyer who is making allegations that will be heard in court.\n\nReaching? No. How do you know? Here\u2019s a *before Apollo purchased Verizon* and an *after Verizon purchased Verizon* comparison of Yahoo\u2019s coverage of Black and Epstein to hammer the media FUD point home. In January, before the Apollo buyout, Yahoo reported Black\u2019s Epstein relationship as follows:\n\n**Black provided support for Epstein\u2019s lavish lifestyle over a five-year period that ended in 2017 \u2014 long after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to a prostitution charge involving a teenage girl**, the review found, according to The New York Times. That report noted that Black \u2014 who will step down by the end of July \u2014 viewed Epstein as a \u201cconfirmed bachelor with eclectic tastes.\u201d\n\nHowever, in the article about Guzel\u2019s allegation of r-pe and coercion after Apollo bought out Verizon, Yahoo characterizes Black\u2019s Epstein relationship as follows:\n\n>Black, 69, stepped down this year as Apollo's chief executive and chairman, after an independent review conducted by the Dechert law firm said he had paid the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning. \n\n>The Dechert report found Black was not involved with Epstein's criminal activities. Black said at the time he deeply regretted his involvement with Epstein. \n\nDraw your own conclusions. Here\u2019s a March news cycle [that characterizes the media probe into Black\u2019s Epstein relationship as a \u2018relentless\u2019 difficulty](https://ca.style.yahoo.com/leon-black-leaves-apollo-executive-112205510.html) for the billionaire Apollo founder. And there\u2019s a wrinkle that I hope blows your mind. This article [from the BCC in the \u2018relentless\u2019 March cycle talks about Black stepping down from the board of Apollo](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56487833); first the characterization of Black\u2019s plight for being scrutinized for paying over $150 million to a known pedophile who he spent time on islands with:\n\n>\"The last weeks and months have been deeply trying for me and my family,\" 69-year-old Mr Black wrote in [a letter to the Apollo board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411494/000119312521088432/d114836dex992.htm) explaining his plans to speed up his departure. \n\n>\"The relentless public attention and media scrutiny concerning my relationship with Jeffrey Epstein - even though the exhaustive Dechert Report concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing on my part - have taken a toll on my health and have caused me to wish to take some time away from the public spotlight that comes with my daily involvement with this great public company.\"\n\nSecond, the BBC provides a mind blowing regulatory capture nugget. Who\u2019s replacing Leon Black as Apollo Global\u2019s executive chairman? This guy:\n\n>Mr Black said he also no longer planned to remain as executive chairman of the company's board. He will be replaced by **former SEC Commissioner Jay Clayton.**\n\nI actually just read that part myself. I\u2019m having dark humor giggles while I write that feel pretty close to tears. An ex-SEC Commissioner became Apollo\u2019s executive chairman because the founding CEO and executive chairman is a central figure in the Epstein scandal. \n\nSo let's just ask the real question: how does this all relate to [retail investor\u2019s Silverback, Adam Aron, our AMC hero](https://nypost.com/2021/02/07/how-amc-staved-off-bankruptcy-before-reddit-rally/)? \n\n**Adam Aron is Leon Black\u2019s protege.**\n\nWith a long history at Apollo Global.\n\nSeriously.\n\nHere\u2019s a Forbes article from 1998 describing how Leon Black and Adam Aron [destroyed small business culture in Vail, Colorado after performing a leveraged buyout of Vail Resorts and weaponizing it against the community](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1998/1019/6209070a.html?sh=6e4a5c9d2a78). We\u2019ll get into this article later in this series.\n\nThe point I\u2019m getting at: Adam Aron\u2019s history shows a decided disregard for apes.\n\nI\u2019m actually angry watching these motherfuckers get predatory with our memes while attempting to set us up for a regulatory fucking with them.\n\nIt also makes me wonder [what Jeffrey DFV was referring to with this tweet](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1400522985375780872?s=20), especially considering [what a \u201cJeffrey\u201d is](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20ingredients%20in%20a%20jeffrey) in Get Him to the Greek.\n\nThere\u2019s also a curiosity in the data about Adam Aron and AMC. This [article titled \u201cAMC\u2019s stock price is detached from reality and its CEO loves it\u201d](https://qz.com/2010310/amc-entertainments-stock-is-growing-again-thanks-to-reddit/) showed up in search engines as \u201cAMC Entertainment\u2019s stock is growing again thanks to Reddit\u201d while hitting news tube websites with the on article title in the search engines. And what\u2019s the curiosity? It could mean nothing, but it\u2019s written by Adam Epstein. \n\nThe article brands Aron a \u201cmeme lord.\u201d He\u2019s not. But the article does show him co-opting memes. For instance, making the donation to a gorilla rescue, something Reddit pushed in February with GameStop; from Epstein\u2019s article:\n\n>\u201cJust go on Twitter, just go on Reddit, just go on YouTube, read what these people write. They love AMC\u2026 I love the idea that we have a compassionate, committed, enthusiastic shareholder base,\u201d Aron added. Aron donated $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity that protects endangered gorillas\u2014a sum AMC matched, he said.\n\nBut is all this meme lording for the benefit of retail investors? After all, Adam Epstein writes:\n\n>Retail investors on Reddit continue to pump up the stock price of the movie theater chain, and now Aron is publicly declaring his allegiance to those millions of shareholders. \u201cThey own AMC,\u201d Aron said on an earnings call last week. \u201cWe work for them. I work for them.\u201d\n\nNo. I don\u2019t think so. Why? Because debt equity and because the article concludes with an important piece of information; Epstein writes:\n\n>**The apes have helped \u2014 AMC\u2019s surging stock price allowed Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm to which AMC is indebted, to convert $700 million in corporate bonds into AMC stock.** But it\u2019s unclear how much more they can materially impact AMC\u2019s finances. The best way for the apes to support AMC and their \u201cSilverback\u201d leader might be to actually go see a movie in a theater.\n\nAnd who is this Silver Lake Partners that apes helped along with AMC?\n\nA vulture fund.\n\nHere\u2019s [an article about Silver Lake raiding Expedia with Leon Black guided Apollo from July, 2020](https://skift.com/2020/07/07/expedia-to-deliver-early-payday-to-private-equity-investors/); from the article:\n\n>Private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Silver Lake Partners rode to Expedia Group\u2019s liquidity rescue in April with a deal to provide $3.2 billion in financing. As its bookings rebounded somewhat, Expedia was looking Tuesday to pay off these firms early, and refinance the debt at a significantly lower interest rate.\n\nAnd:\n\n>If all the pieces fall into place \u2014 if Expedia finds takers for its senior notes \u2014 then it could pay off the private equity firms, and save a bundle in dividend payments. Apollo and Silver Lake would retain their Expedia warrants, which entitled them to each purchase 4.2 million shares of common stock at $72 per share. If the two companies exercised those warrants, their stakes wouldn\u2019t result in any kind of game-changing ownership. Expedia shares Tuesday were trading mid-day at around $84.\n\nWow, eh?\n\nGet your popcorn, apes.\n\n*Part 1.3 dives into the difference in RC and Silverback's approach to company capital. We also take a look at a fascinating wrinkle in GameStop's senior note debt that RC settled. As well, we explore the difference in company outlooks because of the way Silverback is planning to utilize the capital raise from At the MC's share dilution that he promised retail investors he wouldn't go forward with.*\n\n[GOTS, part 1.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nud0so/gods_of_the_sun_part_11_manipulating_the_meme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nGOTS, part 1.2\n\n[GOTS, part 1.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nv333e/gods_of_the_sun_part_13_manipulating_the_meme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",
