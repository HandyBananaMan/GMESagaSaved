I've responded to some of you at the bottom of my post in order to keep the conversation going so that everyone can see it\\]***\n\n**INTRODUCTION:**\n\nThe Gamestop Saga is an ever-evolving story. We have all come such a long way from when we first got involved by buying our first stock, posting memes, and wondering what the heck is going on.\n\nWe've begun to dig deeper, look further, search for missing pieces, and connect the dots in order to paint a picture of what appears to be happening with Gamestop, Wall Street, naked short selling, and hedge funds.\n\nWhat began as individuals posting their thoughts/DD back in February and March, has now turned into a global hivemind where people from all around the world are coming together to collaborate in an effort to share knowledge, and data. People who only know each other by their respective usernames are working together to collect and gather information and they are sharing it with the rest of the world for no reason other than to share information.\n\nI think what's fascinating is not just the quality of the DD being posted, but the fact that the DD is coming from various angles: technical analysis, FTD cycles, dark pools, HFT, SEC filings, and US regulatory rule changes are some angles that come to mind.\n\nEach of these angles tells part of a story. Each one is a chapter unto itself.\n\n# What Wall Street is so desperately afraid of is the power of the r/Superstonk hivemind to post their collective chapters here so that together we can create a book and tell a story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHEN WAS GAMESTOP SHORTED BY HEDGE FUNDS?**\n\nFor a few weeks now, I've been trying to find the answer to this following question:\n\n**\"When did Hedge Funds first start shorting GME?\"**\n\nBeing a lawyer, I'm not good with stocks or the stock market in general. I asked around, but no one really seemed to have an answer. I didn't know where to go or what to search for, really, nor do I have any subscriptions to Bloomberg terminals or stock sites that provide this kind of data.\n\nIt was only when u/HomeDepotHank69 posted [his DD today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nu9qq9/hanks_big_bang_quant_apes_glitch_the_simulation/), which is another excellent collaboration by a number of r/Superstonk users, that I was able to get the answer (or as close to the answer as possible) that I needed in order to share my chapter of the Gamestop Saga with the community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**SI by the charts**  \n>  \n>Below is a chart that the quant apes gathered from Ortex showing the SI of the meme stocks over time. Many of you will say that this is inaccurate because the real SI is hidden. While we have many instances of that being true, this is the best concrete data that we can gather (much better than Fintel and FINRA), so it\u2019s what we must use to avoid speculation. So, yes these numbers are probably an understatement but that\u2019s a good thing because we do not want to speculate. If we can find significant results on incomplete data, our thesis is strengthened:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ \\[Credit to u\\/orangecatmasterrace\\]](https://preview.redd.it/yoe6mfl90w371.png?width=1750&format=png&auto=webp&s=62be2900f0d15efec9fbe031a1b894adaadb2cfa)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MY PREVIOUS SEC LEGALESE TO APE SPEAK POSTS:**\n\nIn my previous SEC Legalese to Ape Speak Posts, I shared information, made several thoughts/comments, went on a few rants, and also made a few predictions. That was my attempt to try and explain what I was seeing/reading and try to interpret it to plain-English.\n\nI also shared my interpretations/thoughts/comments, as well as a few predictions, **based on things that I was not seeing** in Gamestop's 10-K SEC filings.\n\n**A number of my theories turned out to be true.**\n\nMy initial post had a side-by-side chart comparing Gamestop's 2020 and 2021 SEC 10-K filings. I posted it as a table directly to reddit, so it was difficult to properly format/colour code/merge rows/boxes.\n\nThis time around, I made an excel spreadsheet and I've screenshotted it and uploaded it as pictures for you all, both to save text space but also to make it easier to follow along and read.\n\nI now present to you my Magnum Opus:\n\n# How Gamestop is using its SEC 10-K filings to fight back against targeted Naked Short Selling\n\nGamestop's SEC 10-K Filings: A side-by-side comparison of 2018-2021\n\n(empty boxes means that the risk factor was not present in that year's SEC 10-K filing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[Image 1\\]](https://preview.redd.it/u1l4hi38wv371.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f5c1dc3c00a28c17a6bf582673c2a915ca20af0)\n\n[\\[Image 2\\]](https://preview.redd.it/olcusor9wv371.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=a666f16759761c3bfc26a07bac1ef964393e72e6)\n\n[\\[Image 3\\]](https://preview.redd.it/k3po9omawv371.png?width=1422&format=png&auto=webp&s=66435b37c88084945872f1008d9cb80c965fa17b)\n\n[\\[Image 4\\]](https://preview.redd.it/urteavebwv371.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa942f29dd6dc7b9685369ba3cf5f8721583ae84)\n\n[\\[Image 5\\]](https://preview.redd.it/ugzz9b6cwv371.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfa903dd8a1377fe34a70c2c73246f6ce456da05)\n\n[\\[Image 6\\]](https://preview.redd.it/8m6ruoycwv371.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f8a2223d01ec1bb2da38ccac959b80c0ddb2dcc)\n\nWhat does the side-by-side comparison tell us?\n\nWell, a lot, actually.\n\nBut the most significant piece of the puzzle is the last image with the Itemized List of Credit Risks/Indebtedness.\n\n# As we all know by now, the strategy of a short seller is to never cover their shorts.\n\nThey achieve this by forcing a company into bankruptcy through stock price manipulation.\n\nFrom 2017-2019, Gamestop was at risk of going bankrupt, making it a huge target for ~~vultures~~ hedge funds. They could smell blood, and as the chart provided by u/orangecatmasterrace in u/HomeDepotHank69's DD showed, they started shorting Gamestop back in 2018, after their 2018 10-K SEC filing.\n\nThis went on for 3 years. It appeared as if things were getting worse for Gamestop:\n\n* It was in debt;\n* It was failing to attract key personnel;\n* It removed stock dividends;\n* It was falling behind to competitors like Amazon and Steam.\n\nTo Hedge Funds, it seemed like Gamestop was bleeding profusely, and this emboldened them to short the stock even further - they were gambling on what appeared to be a sure-fire win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gamestop's 2021 10-K SEC Filing Changed the Game:**\n\n[In my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/), I commented that:\n\n* In 2021, Gamestop changed their Business Risk Factor title from \"Risks Related to our Business\" to \"Risks related to our ability to grow our business\";\n* In 2021, Gamestop completely removed their \"Risks Relating to Indebtedness\";\n* In 2021, Gamestop included, for the first time, \"Risks Related to Our Common Stock\" and:\n   * confirmed that \"a large proportion of their stock has and may continue to be traded by short sellers\"\n   * referenced a possible short squeeze in the future\n\nI theorized some possible reasons for this in my first, [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdzuuf/breakdown_of_gamestops_sec_10k_from_legalese_to/) and [third](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfrvgq/breakdown_of_gamestops_sec_10k_from_legalese_to/) posts:\n\n* Gamestop no longer sees bankruptcy as a reasonable or forseeable risk factor in 2021\n* Gamestop is no longer in debt\n* Gamestop is confirming that its stock was shorted and may still be shorted\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecent events have shown that my theories were accurate.\n\nHere are just some recent updates, for example:\n\n* **Gamestop is now out of debt**\n* Gamestop is thriving internationally (ex. updated its global websites)\n* Gamestop is working on an NFT\n* Gamestop has hired quality key personnel\n* *Update:* Gamestop is updating its e-commerce strategy *(Forgot to add this in. This is important. See Image 3, Row 3, and my Update below)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why would Gamestop do this?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The message that,** ***I believe***, Gamestop is sending its investors as well as those hedge funds who have shorted it is this:\n\nGamestop is not going anywhere.\n\nShorts must cover.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\n[u\\/luridess out!](https://preview.redd.it/6nhgafsh7w371.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=93f0e5b7258d41665e8d3990e5aeeae77c61bedf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Edits/Updates:***\n\n1. **New Observation as further proof that Gamestop is communicating with shareholders and hedgefunds:** In 2021, Gamestop very sneakily **referenced its e-commerce platform**, **for the first time,** as a possible strategy for retaining customers due to store closures. See Image 3, Row 3. (I forgot to add this in my original post above).\n2. Added e-commerce as another recent update example, which is important given the clues Gamestop left in its 2021 SEC 10-K filing\n3. In response to u/Meegeek's insightful [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nuksk8/sec_legalese_to_ape_speak_final_chapter_how/h0ymild?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):\n   1. Yes I agree with you - 10-K filings are the main communication tool for publicly-listed companies. Normally, these things are very dry and are only read by analysts/lawyers/professionals.\n   2. It's also obvious that this was the case with Gamestop's previous 10-K filings.\n   3. I agree with you that Gamestop's 2021 10-K filing is unique.\n   4. The fact that Gamestop confirmed that its shares were shorted as of January 31, 2021, to me seems like Gamestop is saying between the lines: We are aware of what is going on, we are aware that we are being targeted by naked short sellers who are betting on us going bankrupt, and we are implementing fundamental changes to the company as a way to fight back. Game on.\n   5. This is why we see not only a fundamental shift in risk factors, but also very specific language being used (For example, the addition of \"e-commerce\" as possible strategy for retaining customers due to store closures. These tiny few words hinted at what was coming, something that most of us missed on the first read: Gamestop's fundamental shift in its e-commerce strategy just weeks after filing its 10-K in March 2021)\n   6. My theory is that Hedge Funds probably have hundreds of people hired whose sole job is to go through each company's 10-K filings and determine, on a year-by-year basis, which companies look like they will go bankrupt in the next few years or so. Then, armed with that information, they go after those companies. The side-by-side comparison of Gamestop's 10-K filings seems to be a perfect example of that, right up until 2021.\n4. In response to u/readitfan's comment: I updated the image caption on the Mic Drop to reflect your comment. :)\n5. In response to u/eastrod's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nuksk8/sec_legalese_to_ape_speak_final_chapter_how/h0yuqav?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):\n   1. Thank you. I will certainly take a look at Gamestop's 8-K after it's posted and share my thoughts. I'm subscribed to their SEC Filing RSS feed.\n   2. In the meantime, [here's a link to last year's SEC 8-K](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18081/html), filed on June 18, 2020 after their June 12, 2020 shareholder's meeting.\n   3. Here's the relevant wording used last year:\"On June 12, 2020, the Company held its annual meeting of stockholders (the \u201cAnnual Meeting\u201d). At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders voted on: (1) the election of directors; (2) an advisory non-binding resolution regarding the compensation of the Company\u2019s named executive officers; and (3) the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending January 30, 2021.**First Coast Results, Inc., the independent inspector of the elections (the \"Inspector\") for the Annual Meeting, delivered its final vote tabulation on June 17, 2020 that certified the voting results for each of the matters that were submitted to a vote at the Annual Meeting. According to the Inspector's final tabulation of voting, stockholders representing 42,886,817 shares, or 66.4% of the Company's common stock outstanding as of the record date for the Annual Meeting, were present in person or were represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting.\"**\n6. **In response to** u/eastrod's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nuksk8/sec_legalese_to_ape_speak_final_chapter_how/h0yxuh4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THAT! You're right. Although I didn't know what was going on at the time, I did spot Gamestop slowly trickling shares into the market back on April 15 but no one listened to me \ud83d\ude25\n   1. **EASTER EGG UPDATE:** Another forgotten Easter Egg that I noticed in Gamestop's April 15 SEC filing but didn't know what was happening (because I completely forgot about this until u/eastrod mentioned it in a comment below)\n   2. I [posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwup95/i_figured_out_why_uratioatblessons_mentioned_me/) a month ago in response to some of the conspiracy theories out there about me. It didn't gain a lot of traction and so not many people saw what I spotted: **That Gamestop's total share count was higher on April 15 than it had been when it filed its 10-K in March.**\n   3. In that post, I basically said:  \n*\"If you \ud83e\udd8ds do want to spend some time and energy chasing something, maybe you should try to figure out how Gamestop suddenly has 835,950 MORE shares as of April 15, than it did when it filed its 2021 SEC filing.*  \n*Could be nothing, could be something. I don't have enough wrinkles to figure that out. I'm just good at spotting differences.\"*\n   4. My comment was dismissed, and no one bothered to follow up on that SEC filing.\n   5. It was only after the fact that we all realized this was Gamestop slowly trickling shares into the market...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Not financial or legal advice***",
