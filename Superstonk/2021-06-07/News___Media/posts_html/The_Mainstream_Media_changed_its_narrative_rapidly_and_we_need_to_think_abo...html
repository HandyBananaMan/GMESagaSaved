<p>Dear Apes,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I know I am not the only one to see that something changed drastically with the media this past week. </p>
<p>While being brutally ignored, falsely reported on, accused and shoved into a drawer named "retail TRADERS" and then attacked with major FUD on all forums, suddenly the tides seem to shift and we really need to figure out why to be a step ahead of our enemies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lets start from the absolute bottom. Have you ever heard of News Corp? Sounds like a generic name for the evil cyberpunk corporation owning every medium of information in the far distant future - or simply the shitty, generic name for the biggest media corporation in the English speaking countries. </p>

<p>What you see above is just what they owned a couple years ago but do you know what they own now? Motherfucking Dow Jones &amp; Company, who also own the Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Barrons and Financial News.</p>
<p>So the same company that shows you some nice movies that you watch with your kids at night is the same company that tells your grandparents immigrants are destroying your country and the same company that tells young Wall Street guys who to blame for their bad quarter. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now that we got that established, we need to carefully examine what their game plan is. I am sure you guys have seen this video and if not, please watch it for further education: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fHfgU8oMSo</a> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>See, they are not stupid. Well, they could very well be but they do have influence we mere mortals don't have. And influence is just one of those tools that makes your whole life a lot easier, so who cares how smart you are? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Im getting off track. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>SO the MSM has a goal and an agenda they are trying to portrait on us and that has changed rapidly. See for yourself: </p>

<p>I want to be clear. I don't tell you what to think. I don't even know what to think to myself. The only thing I know for sure besides BUY, HODL, WAIT is that if we side with MSM when they report correctly while ignoring/distrusting them on other times, that gives them INFLUENCE over us which is their only power. So why would they change their narrative now? and don't come with the "oh the money must not have been enough" or "look, they are starting to see the light" or "looks like their owners are bankrupt". NO, NO, NO. They are in on it and we need to figure out what they gain from reporting the news like that. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Look, im just an Europoor ape over here who likes to make memes. But I also don't like being bullshitted at. If someone I know does something disgusting and does not apologise, no, its just part of who they are, you can bet your ass when they are nice is because they use you/want or need something from you instead of their personality having changed. </p>

<p>Stay save out there and quick side note, don't forget to enable 2FA for your accounts! </p>
