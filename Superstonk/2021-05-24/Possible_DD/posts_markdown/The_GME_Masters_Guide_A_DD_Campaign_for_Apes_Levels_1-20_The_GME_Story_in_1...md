Hi all, Blanderson here, back this time with all the DD you wanted in a story you didn't ask for.

Here are 100+ DDs that have shaped the GME saga. 

This is the story of you, Apes, and the DD writers who have held us together and made us proud. As always, I hope you will enjoy.

I polled the Daily Chat about the name of this post and wanted to shout out some of the top alternatives.

u/scrollwheeler \- "The Snoop Scoop"

u/jaxpied \- "🍌🚀"

u/Hefaystos \- "Another useless DD that has nothing smart inside and is nothing more than karma farming."

All very strong contenders, tbh.

💎🙌🦍💗🚀🚀

Lately I have seen a lot of new Apes joining the community, but confused about where to start. I have also seen Apes that need a bit of a confidence boost, or that just want to add a wrinkle about a particular topic so they can sleep better at night. And yes, even some shills get in on the action when they think they can use it to drive a wedge in the community. I literally saw two MOAFUDs in the Daily Chat last night while on patrol.

And you know what, I often find myself unable to answer their questions satisfactorily. I know that *at some point in the past* I came to understand or believe a piece of the puzzle -- SI% is Fake, shorts haven't covered, MOASS inevitable, for example -- but my diamond mind had forgotten the source of its strength.

In my opinion we want to welcome as many new Apes into the fold as possible, and we want to be able to parry any FUD quickly with a link to the 💎🙌 facts and arguments.

That's what this guide is for.

**tl;dr: A chronologically and topically organized guide to the DD that explains the situation at hand and the history of the Apes' contributions to one another. This can be used to quickly get new Apes up to speed, or to confidently shoot down FUD and leave evidence for those who find the comments and posts later.**

I selected DD that I think tells the story of how we got from there to here, as simply and clearly as possible. It's meant to be all the DD necessary to explain the Ape mantra:

Buy. HODL. Vote. Shorts must cover. MOASS is inevitable.

Oh yeah, and just for fun I organized it like an RPG campaign guide, combining backstory with mechanics and an actual play report. I know, I can be a little extra at times.

You'll have to forgive me writing my own character in. I might be one of those annoying GMs that falls too in love with their own character. It's all in good fun, and as always I'm proud to be one among the many (the all!) that have made us stronger together.

This is not an exhaustive list and I'm happy to add to it if I missed something. Let me know in the comments. The fact that this is such a limited-yet-still-overwhelming amount of DD fills me with such gratitude for everyone that has contributed to this journey, including those not named here, the silent HODLers, and everyone else I wrote about in [my poem at the end of Wargame Theory II](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ng4ja0/wargame_theory_ii_the_mother_of_all_fud_moafud/). Just the DD produced in the last week is mindblowing and has its own section.

In addition to a handy guide, I hope this will forever be a fun way to remember a small fraction of what we've built here.

Love you Apes. 💕🦍🦍🦍🦍💕

# Introductory Adventure: Mystery at WallStreetBets (Lvl 1-5)

**Encounter 1: The WTF in Late January**

>*"That's not a squeeze, this (MOASS) is a squeeze!"*

*Whether you lived through it or arrived to the GME party fashionably late, this is a fascinating series of posts that read like a war journal written the week of the January blip. They also act as an introduction to technical analysis and the confusion people felt over how it all went down.*

&#x200B;

**Encounter 2:** **Gremlins in the Squeeze Engine**

*We follow jn\_ku over the next few weeks, as Gamestop spirals farther and farther away from technical analysis and everyone wonders, what's next? You can hear and feel the struggle that rational, technical traders felt regarding Gamestop during this period. The machine wasn't working, but they couldn't yet see the gremlins.*

*To be fair, it was hard to concentrate as the distant echo of millions of Apes bubbled up through the air ducts like drums...drums in the deep.*

*You can also see early evidence of shilling, or social attacks on and off Reddit, which* [will become one of the recurring enemies in this campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnjqpw/dont_forget_what_they_did_a_running_list_of_fud/)*. Just like DFV, jn\_ku suffers ridicule, shaming, and aggressive attempts to scare him off talking about GME at all. Here's his beautiful response:*

&#x200B;

>I have to admit, I was conflicted about this, because the risk is very high, as I've always stated.  
>  
>That being said, I believe that participation in the market is one of the most important rights people should have, and equal participation in the market requires knowledge, transparency, and information. You are all free to make our own choices. Whatever others may say, You *will* make your own choices. At least we can try to help each other make those choices with the best information we have available.

*Fucking legend.*

*His persistence pays off, as he realizes early on that the MOASS is not only a dream, but a technical possibility. The Mother of All Short Squeezes is no macguffin, as the shills claim, but the priceless treasure that drives the entire campaign.*

*Of course, our heroes still do not know how much acquiring that treasure could change the world. That came later.*

&#x200B;

*With the MOASS a confirmed possibility, and armed with a treasure map in the form of technical analysis, our heroes set off to claim that which should have been theirs. But something seems off about the map. Lines and images shift as quickly as they are followed. Going up takes them down, in contrast to all normal market mechanics. They can never quite get where they are going.*

*And lo! They found much turmoil, but for the next two weeks the price of Gamestop rose sharply. It seemed the oracle was right and the squeeze was on!*

*Until, on March 10th, it all came crashing back down.*

*But how? And who was behind this shadowy manipulation? The Apes would spend the next months convening sages and wizards from different lands about this dark magic that should not exist.*

*What they found would change the way they see the world forever.*

&#x200B;

# Second Adventure: The Citadel on Loch Mihgn (Lvl 6-10)

*This adventure introduces the campaign's main villain, Citadel Securities, and uncovers the fuckery afoot in the treasure map.*

**Adventure Background**

*The Apes found themselves in a strange position throughout February. Those who held through the dip to $40 were granted the title* 💎🙌 *and, as individual investors, chose to repeat the* 💎🙌🦍 *Mantra*:

Buy. Hodl. The Shorts Must Cover.

*They still had no idea wen moon, though, and shills had infiltrated the community to its highest levels. Tensions were running high, as the technical picture still wasn't clear and the lines on the map just kept squirming. Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt were on the rise.*

*In came an Ape with a particular set of skills, a master shill-hunter, to lend the Apes support and help them stay strong together.*

*The shill-hunter gave them this advice:*

>Since the hedgies' primary weapon is hidden information, they are trapped. To wield their weapon is to lose it, and to lose it guarantees defeat. **The open, shared information of the Apes is the opposite.** It is a weapon that appears weak in the face of institutional authority and lies, but at least it can be wielded. And if wielded long enough, it forces the other side to flee the battlefield or admit defeat.  
>  
>This is how the squeeze gets squoze.

*The Apes looked at the masterwork information they had gathered so far, and set out to enchant it with magical powers.*

&#x200B;

**Encounter 1: The Sages of Technical Analysis**

*The Apes sought the Sages of Technical Analysis to add wrinkles to their very smooth brains. The first sage they found was young and eager. Believing the MOASS to be at hand, hetried to teach the Apes how to individually unlock the MOASS treasure vault.*

&#x200B;

*The Apes found this information confounding at the time, because no MOASS seemed to be appearing on the map. As they went on their way, they came upon a strange sight: a robust, white-haired sage emerging from an outhouse, still wiping his $ASS with a treasure map just like the ones the Apes were holding. They had found a master, and in his (clean) hand he held a book!*

&#x200B;

*Now this book was a trove of knowledge most certain, but it could only describe what was happening, not explain it. Hank farted as the Apes ooked and aaked, and neither was sure what to make of the other. As a parting gift, or just to get them to leave, Hank told the Apes where to find the Wizards of Data Discovery, who could decipher the various forms of fuckery afoot on the map.*

*The Apes sensed a lot of grinding and side quests ahead, and they weren't wrong. A list of new quests popped up on the Campaign Journal:*

* *How deep in the hole were the shorts?*
* *How were they manipulating the price in the face of constant Ape buying pressure?*
* *How long could they keep manipulating the price?*
* *Could the shorts win?*

*Before they could answer these questions, though, the enemy played a trump card. Shills infiltrated the moderation team of WallStreetBets and the Apes were forced to flee to the town of* r/GME\*. There, for a time at least, they would be safe to research and HODL together.\*

&#x200B;

**Encounter 2: The Wizards of Data Discovery and Analysis**

*The Apes assembled the Data Wizards and each took on a quest, vowing to meet back at the Inn of the Last DFV Tweet in a few weeks' time. As soon as the Apes sent the wizards on their way, they began to ook and aak at memes until the front door of the inn SLAMMED open, revealing a bearded CannaBinoid wizard who bellowed, "Do you even know who you fight, you smoothbrained legion?!"*

*These investigations did wonders for the Apes' morale, as it became clear the hedge funds had no way out as long as the Apes never sold their shares. How long the game would go on was still anybody's guess, but the Apes were feeling good.*

*But wherever Apes party, shills lurk in the shadows.*

*One of the wizards had not yet returned, and the Apes were worried. Finally, dirty and bleeding, the missing wizard collapsed through the door.*

*"I was attacked by shills on the road outside town. They fear what I have to say. It's...it's..." he gasped as pain took over his senses.*

*"...worse than you thought?" Atobitt finished the unconscious man's sentence.*

&#x200B;

*Just then, one of the barmaids pulled a wand and a sword out from behind the bar and said, "Now that you know, I can't let you leave here alive." Shills sprang from every direction,* r/GME *was infiltrated just as WallStreetBets had been before. Was there no end to the Citadel's reach?*

*The Apes chose to flee once again, this time to the land of* r/Superstonk *where they hoped they could decipher the map at last.*

# Third Adventure: A Race for Time (Lvl 11-15)

**Adventure Overview**

*Having explored WallStreetBets and found a most curious treasure map, the Apes assembled the most wrinklebrained among them to try and decipher it. Each time they get close to finding the treasure, some foul market magic sends them back to the beginning.*

*A mysterious group called the FTD seems to be at the center of things, but they only emerge every few weeks for study. The nature of their magic is still unknown to the Sages and Wizards, who would be kept busy with these questions indefinitely.*

*At the same time, two new forms of analysis emerge during April and May, focusing on the evolving cultural and political environment surrounding GME. As Apes learned of the corruption they were facing, several questions began to emerge:*

* *Why is the SEC quiet on this?*
* *Why can we watch illegal activity on the ticker every day and nobody seems to care?*
* *How come Michael Burry deleted his Twitter after being visited by the SEC?*
* *Why are Ryan Cohen and Gamestop talking to Apes so much?*
* *How have we whittled the concept of 💎🙌 down to its simplest, most powerful form?*
* *How has our community made all the right choices along the way?*

*So the Apes called in yet more allies: the Bards of Bureaucracy, to unravel the mystery of the missing MOASS, and the Clerics of Culture to help forge Apes into diamond-minded FUD-killers as well as diamond hands.*

&#x200B;

**Encounter 1: The Bards of Bureaucracy**

*These Apes started looking into a flurry of newly proposed and/or passed rules within the SEC, as well as the nomination of Gary Gensler to be its new chief, for clues as to why the price of the stock moved how it did. Apes were losing faith in technical analysis at this point because the stock never behaved as it should. While the sages and wizards investigated the hidden rules of the market, the bards took a trip to Washington D.C.*

*What they found were a handful of rules that suggested it might be the government or long whales controlling the price rather than the shorts, or at the very least that it might be a tug-of-war between both parties.*

***At some point could the longs have taken control of the game? If so, for what purpose and were the shorts even still involved?***

*Enter the Clerics of Culture to assure Apes that the game was still afoot, and that they were winning.*

&#x200B;

**Encounter 2: The Clerics of Culture**

*As time went on, it became clear to the Apes that they were under constant surveillance and attack. They had gained 50,000 members in a matter of days, many of whom were certainly shills hiding amongst them. Enter the Clerics to guide them to the end of the journey.*

**Encounter 3: Sages and Wizards Explain SI%, FTDs, and Other Fuckery**

*At the same time, the wizards and sages had returned to fill Apes in on everything they had learned. The news was good, very good. Understanding the FTDs had led to the discovery of their mechanism for hiding them. Better still, that mechanism proved that not only had the shorts not covered, but that they had continued digging their hole every day since the January blip.*

&#x200B;

*Of course, with that news the Apes now shifted their attention once again to exit strategies and figuring out when the MOASS might occur using ALL of the knowledge they had gained. The Endgame was here...again.*

*Superstonk's* [*non-monetized YouTube channel*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI4EET9NJPWxUuXGlG6fxPA) *has begun hosting live AMAs with journalists, lawyers, economists, activists, and fintech experts to discuss the GME situation. These have been valuable for clarifying and improving the Apes' information, and raising morale with seasoned reinforcements.*

*May has been all about the slow march to the MOASS, preparing for executing our individual exit strategies, and dreaming about the future. We aren't dancing, we are adamant. We are diamond hands and diamond minds.*

*Here's how Apes are gearing up for the final adventure.*

There we go, 100 DDs that tell the story, calm the mind, and shine a light on just a fraction of what we have been through and accomplished together.

For visual purposes I decided not to tag the individual authors, so if you think one of them would like to see this or you've been helped or moved by something written above, I encourage you to tag the authors in a comment below and thank them.

I finish typing this as I wait for the markets to open on what could be the greatest day of Apes' lives (Homer: "Greatest day SO FAR"), the beginning of the worst financial crisis in history, or some combination of both (May 24). Now I'm going to post this and join the rest of you. Maybe today's the day we decipher the map, if not there are more good days ahead.

I'll let Lou Reed close this out for me,

# Appendix A

Venture into the epic-level DD below if you want to see just how far this thing might go. By the time you read this, we may know the truth about all of this.

# Epic Level Adventure: The Deepest Depths of DD

These DDs are not for the faint of heart, and go beyond what I consider to be strictly GME DD. They are about what the GME saga has revealed about the U.S. economy and stock market. It's the best investigative journalism on the subject, and will, IMO, be where future journalists start when they seek to understand what's to come.

Again, if you're here for GME DD, this section is, IMO, unnecessary unless you've read everything else and STILL wonder how the fuck we got here and where we might be going. Here ya go.
