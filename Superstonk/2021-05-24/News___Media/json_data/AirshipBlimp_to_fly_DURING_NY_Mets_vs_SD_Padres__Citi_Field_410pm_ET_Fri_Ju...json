Like by the NYSE or even Citadel HQ in Chicago.\n\nI chose Citi Field because of most recommendations from fellow apes in last posts.\n\nThe reason being because the owner of NY Mets also the Hedge Fund Manager and founder of Point 72 is Steve Cohen.\n\n\"Steve Cohen's hedge fund Point72 has raised $1.5 billion after suffering heavy losses in January and providing a lifeline to Melvin Capital, as short-sellers were hit by the GameStop saga, according to a [**report in Bloomberg**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/cohen-s-point72-raises-1-5-billion-after-melvin-infusion) and other outlets. \"\n\nsource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-point72-raises-money-gamestop-saga-melvin-capital-2021-2-1030039224](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-point72-raises-money-gamestop-saga-melvin-capital-2021-2-1030039224)\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nSo this next one may be a longshot, yes, but still the message needs to be heard and seen.\n\nPre or post MOASS, it is still just as relevant.\n\n**This is the change that has to happen.**\n\nI know I know, some of you may say buy more shares instead, but this has the potential to reach **millions** tuning into the game.\n\nThis can cause the kind of buying pressure along with awareness that will make every single Short Hedge Fund tremble in their daisy dukes.\n\nAlso to make the SEC and U.S. GOVT **finally** legislate much needed reform. Or the way I like to put it, make them do their fucking jobs for once!\n\nApparently no change happens unless **the people** get angry enough. Well I for one, know I'm fucking pissed TF off so if you're feeling the same way, let's channel that energy into supporting a great cause.\n\nAre we going to take this lying down?\n\nOr for once, just for one moment in history, are we going to take a **REAL fucking** **stand!?**\n\nWith all that said, it's my pleasure to give another very special and well deserved thank you to:\n\nu/pinkcatsonacid and Lucy Komisar for the most recent AMA.\n\nDespite being cut short due to technical difficulties, the information shared was unignorably powerful and it definitely lit a fire under my ass!!!\n\n# Let's create a message that will go down in the history books!\n\n# One that will be heard and seen around the world!!\n\n# Let's get the sleeping giant aka the public to:\n\n# WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!\n\nI'd like the message to read something as follows:\n\n>**Since The Great Depression,**  \n>  \n>**the SEC and U.S. GOVT have ignored NAKED SHORT SELLING.**  \n>  \n>**In doing so, NEGLECTED the best interest of the people.**  \n>  \n>**This is CLASS WARFARE and GameStop is the battlefield.**  \n>  \n>**BUY HOLD & VOTE $GME For more info visit** [**Reddit.com/r/Superstonk**](https://Reddit.com/r/Superstonk)\n\nIn case it needs to be shortened:\n\n>**\\*\\*ATTENTION\\*\\* SEC and US GOVT: BAN NAKED SHORT SELLING!!!**  \n>  \n>**This is CLASS WARFARE and GameStop is the battlefield.**  \n>  \n>**BUY HOLD & VOTE $GME For more info visit** [**Reddit.com/r/Superstonk**](https://Reddit.com/r/Superstonk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*The location and message is not permanent and can be changed.
