These hearings never really expose anything big and the right questions are never asked. But it would definitely give the government and the banks cause to think that we\u2019re watching them very closely if we can get a ton of views on the hearings themselves. Who knows, it might be entertaining to at least see some of the more progressive government officials yelling at the banking slimeballs, or better yet someone might even accidentally incriminate themselves.\n\nIt\u2019ll be worth watching all of these if you have the time. At least we\u2019ll see what the narrative the government and the banks are trying to push.",
