<p>Would like to start off with giving a very special thank you to all of those who helped with last aerial banner that flew over Oracle Park &amp; Chase center in SF before Giants vs Dodgers and Warriors vs Mavericks games on Friday May 21st, 2021.</p>

<p>Due to air restrictions could not have last plane fly over during game.</p>
<p>Well going to be hearing back tomorrow from <a href="https://www.aerialmessages.com/create-a-shared-flight/">https://www.aerialmessages.com/create-a-shared-flight/</a> for inquiry on a blimp to fly over Citi Field <strong>during</strong> the game.</p>
<p>On the website it says they may be able to get waivers to allow it.</p>
<p>If not, we can shoot for before the game or any area with the most visibility as possible. Like by the NYSE or even Citadel HQ in Chicago.</p>
<p>I chose Citi Field because of most recommendations from fellow apes in last posts.</p>
<p>The reason being because the owner of NY Mets also the Hedge Fund Manager and founder of Point 72 is Steve Cohen.</p>
<p>"Steve Cohen's hedge fund Point72 has raised $1.5 billion after suffering heavy losses in January and providing a lifeline to Melvin Capital, as short-sellers were hit by the GameStop saga, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/cohen-s-point72-raises-1-5-billion-after-melvin-infusion"><strong>report in Bloomberg</strong></a> and other outlets. "</p>

<p>Let that sink in.</p>
<p>So this next one may be a longshot, yes, but still the message needs to be heard and seen.</p>
<p>Pre or post MOASS, it is still just as relevant.</p>
<p><strong>This is the change that has to happen.</strong></p>
<p>I know I know, some of you may say buy more shares instead, but this has the potential to reach <strong>millions</strong> tuning into the game.</p>
<p>This can cause the kind of buying pressure along with awareness that will make every single Short Hedge Fund tremble in their daisy dukes.</p>
<p>Also to make the SEC and U.S. GOVT <strong>finally</strong> legislate much needed reform. Or the way I like to put it, make them do their fucking jobs for once!</p>
<p>Apparently no change happens unless <strong>the people</strong> get angry enough. Well I for one, know I'm fucking pissed TF off so if you're feeling the same way, let's channel that energy into supporting a great cause.</p>
<p>Are we going to take this lying down?</p>
<p>Or for once, just for one moment in history, are we going to take a <strong>REAL fucking</strong> <strong>stand!?</strong></p>
<p>With all that said, it's my pleasure to give another very special and well deserved thank you to:</p>
<p>u/pinkcatsonacid and Lucy Komisar for the most recent AMA.</p>
<p>Despite being cut short due to technical difficulties, the information shared was unignorably powerful and it definitely lit a fire under my ass!!!</p>
<h1>Let's create a message that will go down in the history books!</h1>
<h1>One that will be heard and seen around the world!!</h1>
<h1>Let's get the sleeping giant aka the public to:</h1>
<h1>WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!</h1>
<p>I'd like the message to read something as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Since The Great Depression,</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>the SEC and U.S. GOVT have ignored NAKED SHORT SELLING.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>In doing so, NEGLECTED the best interest of the people.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>This is CLASS WARFARE and GameStop is the battlefield.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>BUY HOLD &amp; VOTE $GME For more info visit</strong> <a href="https://Reddit.com/r/Superstonk"><strong>Reddit.com/r/Superstonk</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case it needs to be shortened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>**ATTENTION** SEC and US GOVT: BAN NAKED SHORT SELLING!!!</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>This is CLASS WARFARE and GameStop is the battlefield.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>BUY HOLD &amp; VOTE $GME For more info visit</strong> <a href="https://Reddit.com/r/Superstonk"><strong>Reddit.com/r/Superstonk</strong></a></p>
