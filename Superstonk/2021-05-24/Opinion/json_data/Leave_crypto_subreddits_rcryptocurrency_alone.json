    "selftext": "Those subs are a place for crypto discussions, not gme. Regardless of the obvious connection between the recent crypto crash and MOASS, it is not our place to go over there and try to \"recruit\" and post off topic discussions. All apes need to find us on their own and make their own decisions. Recuritment could be seen as MARKET MANIPULATION and could be used to fuck us in the end. Giving awards to improve visibility on posts related to gme could fall into that category. Better safe than sorry, dont do it.\n\nJust let crypto subs be about crypto. They are not isolated, they have heard about the MOASS. They are adults, let them make their own decision. My hunch is as we get closer and closer to the MOASS more people will be piling in here to blow down lines of crayola and ride the rocket to mars. ORGANICALLY\n\nI've already seen posts over there that say they want to auto remove all posts regarding WSB \"conspiracies\". Is that how we want people to look at us? The more we stick our noses where they dont belong, the more anti gme posts will start being posted over there, plain and simple. This hurts apes mission. https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/njloc5/hot_take_the_wsb_avatars_that_have_flooded_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/njln72/can_we_officially_decide_that_wsb_posts_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nThink of it this way,  you're a new crypto investor and havent heard about MOASS. Your first exposure to the MOASS is on another sub talking about how we are all crazy and are going to lose all of our money. This post he read was made by a guy who just wants r/cryptocurrency to be purely about crypto. Potential new ape is now an agent of FUD and tells him what he read. You follow? \n\n\n\nHow would we feel if some other group came in here and started posting non gme related content? We wouldn't like it. Hell, we dont even like when AMC apes post in here. \n\nRecruitment should not be tolerated and it hurts fellow apes. Dont do it. \n\n\nTHAT BEING SAID \nI welcome you new guys with open arms. Read the DD in the side bar, check out the AMAs and get informed! \n\nBUY HOLD AND VOTE \n\npeace\n\nEdit: Added some examples of negative posts from R/cryptocurrency",
