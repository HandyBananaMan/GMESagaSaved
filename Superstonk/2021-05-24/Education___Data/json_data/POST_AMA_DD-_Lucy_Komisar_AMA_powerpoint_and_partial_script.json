A meme went \u201che who sells what isn\u2019t his\u2019n must pay it back or go to prison.\u201d Traders would print up counterfeit stock certificates. Sound familiar. Naked short selling. The crash that started the depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ferdinand Pecora](https://preview.redd.it/l346v5i456171.jpg?width=470&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbf1ac2b34080b60690ed448ed917fbce742f990)\n\n**1932 Ferdinand Pecora** was an immigrant working class kid from Sicily who put himself through New York Law School. He was hired in 1932 by the Senate Banking Committee to investigate the causes of the crash, to do a whitewash, but he didn\u2019t get the memo. His hearings exposed such practices as pools to support bank stock prices. Such as Let\u2019s all coordinate trades to pump up the stock. Sound familiar? GameStop?  National City Bank (now Citibank) had hidden bad loans by packaging them into securities and selling them off to unwary investors. Sound familiar? Mortgage-backed securities that tanked? And that the bank sellers knew would tank?\n\nThe findings of the Pecora Commission exposing corruption of the financial industry let to public support for regulation, -- it took really dirty stuff to move the pubic -which would be the Glass\u2013Steagall Banking Act of 1933, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. That last set up the SEC.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt appointed Joseph Kennedy (father of Jack and Robert) SEC chair. He had built the family fortune on financial manipulation, but Roosevelt thought he knew where the bodies were buried, who the miscreants. So the SEC cleaned up the Wall Street stables for five years. Then Kennedy\u2019s buddies of the financial oligarchy took charge again, in early regulatory capture.\n\nPecora wrote a memoir, Wall Street Under Oath. He said: \"Bitterly hostile was Wall Street to the enactment of the regulatory legislation.\" What, the thieves don\u2019t want rule of law? About disclosure rules, he said that \"Had there been full disclosure of what was being done in furtherance of these schemes, they could not long have survived the fierce light of publicity and criticism. Legal chicanery and pitch darkness were the banker's stoutest allies.\" Think about who are their allies today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Irving Pollack-  Father of the SEC Division of Enforcement](https://preview.redd.it/kulo5kk756171.jpg?width=354&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89e834a1f13f04b2d889fdc66e9156d0bab67db1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1985 Irving Pollack**\n\nFast forward about half a century. With the support of friends in Congress, Wall Street has neutered the securities acts by assuring the SEC would not enforce them. It made sure its foxes were guarding the henhouse. But the corruption was sometimes inconvenient. In 1985, the National Association of Securities Dealers, now FINRA, which represents the brokers, hired Irving Pollack, a former SEC commissioner who was honest, to look at short selling. Among his report\u2019s proposals: reporting of short interest \u2013 the amount of short sales not yet covered -- should be public and perhaps more frequent. A borrowing for delivery in broker-dealer transactions should be required. A mandatory buy-in should be adopted for a delivery after a reasonable period when there has been a fail. That means the broker for the buyer who hasn\u2019t gotten the shares can buy them on the market and charge the short seller\u2019s broker. There should be surveillance of large short-interest positions, shorts not yet covered.\n\nDid the SEC adopt these proposals with enthusiasm? Obviously not. Short interest is not reported frequently. Broker dealers \u201clocate\u201d instead of borrow or they use counterfeit shares. There\u2019s no buy-in. Buy-ins were allowed but not required. And Leslie Boni, an academic who in 2004 did a paper for the SEC on buy-ins said they were rare. But requiring buy-ins would make the stock go up, the shorts lose money.\n\nAnd there was no surveillance of large short-interest positions.\n\nIn fact, corruption would be increased thanks to friends of Wall Street president Bill Clinton and his collaborator Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin (formerly of Citibank) who in 1999, killed the Glass-Steagall Act which had separated investment banking from retail banking. Retail banks till then could not use depositors' funds for risky investments. Only 10% of their income could come from selling securities.\n\nThat sets the stage for the last few decades.\n\n**2004** RegSHO set up to fail\n\nThe SEC, battered with complaints, in July 2004 promulgated Reg SHO, SHO for short selling. The hedge funds and big brokers who had been or would be shown to be illegally shorting all lobbied against it. It was a tepid reform of short selling that was Swiss-cheesed with loopholes. Think of Al Capone writing the tax laws. (On the other hand, his crooked progeny do write the tax laws!) Reg SHO would be implemented in 2005\n\nThe SEC knocked out a proposal for penalties for failing to deliver.\n\nAnd it wrote two giant exceptions into Reg SHO. Ex-clearing and market makers.\n\nThe rule didn\u2019t apply to ex-clearing, which means clearing outside the DTCC, The Depository Trust Clearing Corporation, the national stock clearing company. (Yes, it\u2019s a private company owned by the broker dealers) It applied only to trades going through a registered clearing agency, i.e. what got sent through the DTCC. It said ex-clearing was \u201crare.\u201d\n\nSales that avoided clearing agencies could fail \u2013 not be delivered -- without buyers\u2019 brokers reporting the fails to the DTCC or buying in, requiring the short sellers broker to buy shares on the market and deliver them. To protect short sellers and avoid Reg SHO, dealers went ex-clearing. They either cleared internally or with a cooperating broker-dealer or they went through dark pools. They were private exchanges set up by the big prime brokers and banks.\n\nThe major perpetrators are the large banks, doing it for large clients, hedge funds, or their own accounts. If they can do the transaction privately \\[ex-clearing\\], RegSHO doesn\u2019t apply. Now about 40% of trades go through dark pools. *If a trade failed ex-clearing, it didn\u2019t fail at the DTCC!*\n\nReg SHO also didn\u2019t apply to derivatives, the financial casino bets acknowledged as a prime cause of the current economic crisis and which also did not trade through a clearing house.\n\nEven stocks that cleared through the DTCC were not always covered. The brokers got a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d that allowed existing fails to continue! Because we know that brokers simply rolled them over. And brokers didn\u2019t have to close out the shares they had sold short before the stock went on the Threshold List which includes shares that for five consecutive settlement days had fails to deliver of 10,000 shares or more at a clearing agency and where the level of fails was equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer\u2019s outstanding shares.\n\nThen brokers were subject to mandatory covering only on the fifth day. Then the broker-dealer had 13 days to deliver the shares to the buyer or lender, and if it failed to do so, it could not trade that stock until it did. But the SEC knew, because staff wrote a paper on it, how options conversions allowed brokers to put off fail dates forever.\n\n**MARKET MAKERS**\n\nRegSHO allowed an options market maker exception, called after the person who designed and pushed for it: the Madoff Exception! (Did I say the crooks wrote the rules?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bernie Madoff, who died in prison in Apr 2021](https://preview.redd.it/ndifb6fvk6171.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b96285ed2e17c6fa057802f34861c4c532400c0)\n\nIn prison in 2012 Madoff told Forbes journalist Diana Henriques: \u201cI fell into my crime of staying Naked Short. The fact that the prosecutor and Trustee seemed clueless of this is why my frustration is so great.\u201d Clueless, or complicit? You just don\u2019t go there.\n\nThe SEC in 2007 eliminated Uptick Rule that requires short sales to be conducted at a higher price than the previous trade. Not helpful if the purpose is to batter down the stock price. It was never enforced.\n\n2008 **Stock lending and taking care of the banks**\n\nAccording to the SEC Office of Economic Analysis (2008) Reg SHO in effect since 2005 had not reduced outstanding fails. Many stocks remained on the SEC Regulation SHO Threshold List for hundreds of trading days\n\nFor years, the SEC claimed naked short selling and fails to deliver were not a problem. Once things began to go sour in 2008, the first thing the SEC did was ban naked short selling in 17 financial stocks plus Fannie and Freddie. It was ironic, since the big banks/brokers had been carrying out the scam on others. Hoist on their own petard.\n\nAnd they chose the solution that people battling naked short selling had advocated for years. A July 2008 order said no traders could make trades involving those institutions unless they had pre-borrowed the security or otherwise had it available in their inventory. They had to deliver the security on the settlement date. Borrow shares before you sell them short. Stop the counterfeiting. All the regs that came out were because naked shorting, the counterfeiting of shares, was undermining banks. The SEC went from nothing is happening till the fall of 2008 that the market coming apart because of naked shorting. They chose the solution that people battling naked short selling had advocated for years. Borrow shares before you sell them short. Stop the counterfeiting.\n\nThe SEC said it was investigating the collapse of Bear Stearns. It had been massively naked shorted. The SEC didn\u2019t come up with anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ted Kaufman- former US Senator, Delaware](https://preview.redd.it/jca68d5g56171.jpg?width=330&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=741e78b0f0b0ac9ab85b0f27f872316eabbca976)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2009 Kaufman and the hard locate**\n\nA little-known backstory involved former Delaware Senator Ted Kaufman who ran Biden\u2019s post-election transition team. It shows how big stock market players and the institutions they control have blocked attempts to deal with naked short selling. Kaufman was Biden\u2019s longtime chief of staff, and was named to the Senate seat vacated by his boss when Biden became Barack Obama\u2019s vice president.\n\nAfter the 2008 market meltdown that included abusive naked short selling of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, Kaufman, a Democrat, and Georgia senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican, introduced legislation that directed the SEC to write regulations to end the practice. They determined that the SEC\u2019s current regulations were unenforceable. Hedge funds could spread rumors, do massive shorts without locating stocks, and deliver after the prices dropped.\n\nIn July 2009, Kaufman and six colleagues from both parties wrote to the SEC, proposing a \u201chard locate\u201d plan that would ban all short sales unless the executing broker first obtained a unique identification number for the shares, perhaps through an automated centralized system. This would prevent multiple short sales on the basis of a single share.\n\nAccording to Jeff Connaughton, then Kaufman\u2019s chief of staff, months before the letter, \u201cthe DTCC (the national stock clearing agency) had gone to the SEC with a proposed solution to naked short selling that looked like Kaufman\u2019s solution, with the DTCC creating a centralized database that would prevent the same shares from being used for multiple short sales.\n\nThe DTCC told Connaughton, \u2018We got pulled back.\u2019 They meant, he said, by their board, by the Wall Street powers-that-be.\u201d Because in the case of the DTCC as well as the SEC, the fox is guarding the henhouse.\n\nIn 2009 staffers of the Senators met with the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division to find out the status of its investigation into the naked short selling of Bear Stearns and Lehman stock. SEC lawyers told them they\u2019d have to be patient and that the investigation would take at least another year. It never happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ted Kaufman as long time advisor to the current President](https://preview.redd.it/m6a9h2jl56171.png?width=263&format=png&auto=webp&s=4074499e1301f9ad2712d1a806d20a0383873fa2)\n\n**2010** Kaufman continued to try to fight naked short selling in the Dodd-Frank debate. SEC had been ordered by the Dodd-Frank law of 2010 11 years ago to require more transparency in short selling and stock lending. It has ignored it.\n\nThere were some alleged improvements made that year, 2008.\n\nThe market makers exemption was eliminated, because the SEC said substantial levels of fails had continued in Threshold securities, and a significant number were the result of market maker exceptions. But they still had 6 days to settle their trades. So you have market makers failing and rolling their shares over every 5 \u00bd days.\n\nThe grandfather provision on Threshold securities was eliminated. Unless its position in Threshold securities was closed, a broker-dealer couldn\u2019t effect further shorts in them without borrowing or arranging to borrow the securities. Don\u2019t worry, they finessed that.\n\nThe amendments addressed fake borrows. It said that where a broker-dealer entered into an arrangement with another party to purchase or borrow securities, and the broker-dealer knew or has reason to know that the other party would not deliver securities in settlement of the transaction, the purchase or borrow would not be *\"bona fide.\u201d*\n\nIt repeated that: \u201cThe NSCC  - clears and settles the majority of equity securities trades conducted on the exchanges and in the over-the-counter market.\u201d\n\nSo the rules still didn\u2019t apply to ex-clearing and dark pools. So the ex-clearing route to naked shorts was protected. fails could be concealed at the start by ex-by not reporting them to the NSCC, the National Securities Clearing Corporation.\n\nIn fact, the dealers could use ex-clearing to opt out of fails from trades through the exchanges. They could take them onto their own books and deal with the fails as they chose to, meaning do nothing, let the fails sit\\*.\\*\n\nAnd protecting the interests of the big banks/brokerages, the SEC did not include a hard locate requirement in its amendments to Reg SHO.\n\nBut the SEC occasionally takes enforcement actions that go after low-hanging fruit, ie don\u2019t bother anyone significant or don\u2019t order more than minor penalties, the cost of doing business.\n\n**2003 Sedona/Badians**\n\nThe Sedona case, where the Badian brothers ran a death spiral financing scheme that in 2001 involved providing a loan that would be repaid in shares. And then it did a massive shorting attack that knocked down the price of the shares from $6 to 20cents. the SEC in February 2003 filed a complaint against Thomas Badian and his company, Rhino, for fraud and market manipulation of Sedona shares. Badian and Rhino immediately settled with the SEC for a $1-million fine without admitting or denying guilt. The $1 mil was a pittance, cost of doing business.\n\nIn 2006, the SEC filed a civil suit against Andreas Badian, four officials of Pond Equities and a trader at Refco, all involved directly in the naked shorting, but not against Ladenburg, the high-profile broker-dealer that facilitated the deals and collaborators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqrt6qam66171.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f91e36651dc8f18ba0e83a6e77d3bc079b718f3c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2005 Eagletech**\n\nEagletech, which had an invention, new at the time, to push phone calls to other devices. letting people to usee a single phone number that followed them from phone to phone. He became a target of a group of death spiral financing criminals working with Salomon Smith Barney in New York five Salomon officers and a group of investors offering to buy convertible preferred shares from Eagletech for up to $6 million\n\nThey did a pump up and then naked shorting so the stock dropped from $14 to 75 cents, reducing the market value by $113 ml. The stock went to 2 cents. The FBI was investigating. They busted 17 members of organized crime, including the crooks that ran the scheme against Eagletech.\n\n**SEC filed suit** against Serubo, Labella and organized crime collaborators who ran the corrupt operation that got control of stock of Eagletech. It said they generated in excess of $12.7 million from the sale of Eagletech stock. Members of his Salomon Smith Barney financing team and their options market-makers in Chicago were selling shares and then failing to deliver.\n\nSerubo, Labella and organized crime collaborators would be banned from penny stock trading and pay back the ill-gotten gains and fines. I couldn\u2019t find any penalties against the Salomon Smith Barney team or their options market maker collaborators.\n\nThen the SEC filed suit against the victim, Eagletech, to deregister its shares because it couldn\u2019t afford several hundred thousand dollars to file audited financial reports. The delisting is like a bankruptcy, all investors are wiped out and the naked shorters never have to cover. The SEC finished what the mob started, it killed the company.\n\n**2007 Goldman**\n\nFrom at least March 2000 to May 2002, that\u2019s more than 2 years, certain customers of Goldman Clearing used the firm's direct market access, automated trading system to unlawfully sell securities short in advance of follow-on and secondary offerings when they could get the shares cheaper.\n\nAlthough they were selling the offered securities short, used Goldman Clearing's direct market access, automated trading platform, the REDI System, preparing their own orders to sell on computer terminals and falsely marked them \u201clong.\u201d The orders were routed directly to the New York Stock Exchange and other markets for execution.\n\nGoldman Clearing's own records contained information that Customers were selling securities short and that they were misrepresenting their \u201cshort\u201d sales as \u201clong\u201d. Goldman Clearing's records showed that the customers were repeatedly failing to deliver to Goldman Clearing the securities that they purported to sell long.\n\nSo for two years of allowing shorts to be marked longs, Goldman had to pay civil money penalty of \u2013 wait for it -- $1 million\n\n**2012 SEC v OptionsXpress**\n\nOptionsXpress, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Charles Schwab repeatedly engaged in sham transactions, known as \u201cresets,\u201d designed to give the appearance of having purchased shares to close-out an open failure-to-deliver position while in fact not doing so.\n\nOptionsXpress had its customers buying shares and simultaneously selling call options that were the equivalent of selling shares short. The purchase of shares created the illusion that the firm had covered the short; however, the shares were never actually delivered to the buyers because on the same day, calls were exercised, effectively reselling the shares. The purpose was to perpetuate an open short position.\n\nIn 2009, the six optionsXpress customer accounts bought $5.7 billion worth of securities and sold short approximately $4 billion of options. They did this to a couple of dozen companies. In January 2010, the customers who did the scam accounted for 48% of the daily trading volume in Sears. In the end OptionsXpress had to pay $4 million. Cost of doing business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gary Aguirre- Former Investigator for SEC & Whistleblower](https://preview.redd.it/si49uknr56171.jpg?width=206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56bf1d0512b8fdfc9e42c662d506fd8bc85c821f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The insiders tell the SEC corruption**\n\nThe story of Gary Aguirre says it all\n\nAs a student at Georgetown Law School, Aguirre got a prize from the SEC for paper on Wall Street corruption as detailed in the Pecora hearings that led to passage of the Securities Act of 1933. So we know where he stands.  In September 2004, he started as a senior counsel at the SEC Division of Enforcement. He said, \u201cI understood what SEC was supposed to be doing: keep Wall Street from running amok. The SEC in July had promulgated Reg SHO, which it said would stop abusive naked short selling.  He recalled, \u201cThe first thing I noticed is there seemed to be a deference to the large law firms who represented Wall Street players. And there were a lot of people there not at the same skill set level as the attorneys representing some of the players from Wall Street.\n\nAguirre was assigned to an investigation that implicated a powerful Wall Street insider. John Mack had been head of the hedge fund Pequot Capital Management. The suspicion was that Mack had tipped Pequot\u2019s then CEO, Arthur Samberg, of General Electric's pending acquisition of Heller Financial. Mack was the only suspect. Without that investigation, the SEC would never be able to even consider the filing of insider trading charges against Mack, Samberg, Pequot or anyone else arising out of Pequot\u2019s trading in GE and Heller\n\nAguirre refused to stop his investigation; Senior officials within the SEC's Division of Enforcement blocked an SEC subpoena seeking Mack\u2019s testimony and records in the investigation. Aguirre had contacted the Office of Special Counsel to discuss the filing of a complaint about the SEC\u2019s protection of Mack. Three days later, while on vacation, Aguirre was abruptly fired without warning on September 1, 2005, he was fired by phone.\n\nAn SEC official told him it would be very difficult to take Mack's testimony because of his political influence. He told him that Mack was \"an industry captain,\" that he had powerful contacts . . . , that Mary Jo White could contact a number of powerful individuals, any of whom could call Linda about the examination. Mary Jo White was a lawyer at a Wall Street firm, Linda was Linda Thomsen, the head of enforcement. Aguirre confirmed the conversation in two e-mails to the official the next morning. The first email referenced Ferdinand Pecora.\n\nAguirre gave key papers to Charles Grassley on the Senate Finance Committee. And to the Judiciary Cmte. There were hearings in 2006.\n\nHe told Congress that an SEC official told him it would be very difficult to take Mack's testimony because of his political influence. The official told him Mack was \"an industry captain,\" that he had powerful contacts . . . , that Mary Jo White could contact a number of powerful individuals, any of whom could call Linda about the examination. Mary Jo White was a lawyer at a Wall Street firm, Linda Thomsen was head of enforcement.\n\nHe said the SEC \u201cfavor\u201d to Mack cleared the way for his return on June 30, 2005, as Morgan Stanley\u2019s CEO with no danger of an SEC lawsuit for insider trading. Mary Jo White would become chair of the SEC 2013 to 2017, appointed by Wall Street\u2019s favorite guy, Barak Obama, who apparently didn\u2019t know the Aguirre story.\n\nLater David Kotz, the SEC's inspector general, said he had found evidence that \"raised serious questions about the impartiality and fairness\" of the SEC's investigation of possible insider trading at the Pequot Capital Management hedge fund.\n\nKotz also condemned what he called the \"common practice\" of giving outside lawyers' clients access to high-level SEC officials when they had complaints about front-line investigators. Kotz made numerous recommendations for reform, which the SEC ignored.\n\nAguirre sued the SEC and won \u00be of million $ in back pay and damages.\n\nMack, after being CEO Morgan Stanley, became CEO of Credit Suisse, then chair of Morgan Stanley and now is senior advisor to the global investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, whose strategic partners are hedge funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Mark Fickes](https://preview.redd.it/odru363cqa171.jpg?width=200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=852f95acbb1d5354e65c9f6b1fc32c131c93a32a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2005 Fickes and Overstock, Chris Cox**\n\nHere\u2019s another case of an SEC staffer who tried to do the right thing but was pulled back. In August 2005, Overstock.com filed suit against hedge fund Rocker Partners and the equities research firm, Gradient Analytics saying they illegally colluded in short-selling the company while paying for negative reports to drive down share prices.\n\nByrne took his information to the SEC. Mark Fickes of the SEC San Francisco office. He said, \u201cLook at the patterns, their stocks are naked shorted by Dan Loeb, David Einhorn, Steven Cohen, David Rocker. \\[Look at\\] the dates journalists Bethany, Boyd, Remond, Greenberg wrote trash jobs.  \\[that was Bethany McLean writing for Fortune, Carol Remond for Dow Jones, Roddy Boyd for the NY Post, Herb Greenberg for MarketWatch\\] Byrne said, \u201cIt was the same pattern, each one of these one of these journalists writes a hatchet job, there is naked shorting, SEC action begins against them, and the Milberg Weiss lawsuit. In every case, it\u2019s part of same bum rush on the stock.\u201d\n\nByrne argued that Gradient, an investment advisor which was putting out fraudulent reports the shorters used, should be investigated \u2013 and that the journalists were central to his case. The subpoenas were issued to Carol Remond and Herb Greenberg to provide information about conversations that they had with stock traders and analysts.\n\nFickes issued the subpoenas with the approval of the SEC\u2019s head of enforcement, Linda Thomsen. It was announced that the SEC was investigating Gradient and had issued subpoenas to Carol Remond, Herb Greenberg and to Jim Cramer of TheStreet. David Rocker sold his shares in TheStreet. A month later Cramer sold some of his shares.\n\nBryne: \u201cJim Cramer gets a subpoena; you have three days to disclose it. He knows TheStreet will crater, he can\u2019t just go sell it with undisclosed material information. He can get a plan to sell x amount per quarter after he gets the subpoena. TheStreet broke under a dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would a hedge fund guy have an interest to own a financial publication? Cramer discloses in his books stuff that is widely illegal. Protection for journalists is about protecting sources about stories they are writing, not about their own corrupt market manipulation.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether freedom of the press extends to reporters whose articles are part of  illegal naked short selling scams. Fickes wanted to know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chris Cox- Former SEC Chair](https://preview.redd.it/s650tr5z56171.jpg?width=330&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e085154954818611d3c78b7b0ed95a00a02303c7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe was summoned to Washington to meet with the new SEC chair, Cris Cox. Ultimately, Byrne said, the SEC caved under the media pressure. Cox killed the subpoenas and the SEC dropped its investigation of Gradient. Cox was SEC chair when Gary Aguirre was fired.\n\n**What should the SEC do now? Solutions are there if it wants to protect investors, not do as it is told by the big broker-dealers.**\n\n* Require buy-ins. Require the broker of the investor who doesn\u2019t get shorted stock delivered to buy it on the market and charge the seller\u2019s broker. Of course, requiring buy-ins would make the stock go up, the shorters lose money.\n* Restore the uptick rule so shorters can\u2019t sell for less that the last shorted trade. That would stop shorters hammering a stock down to bankruptcy.\n* Create a consolidated audit trail (CAT) to collect order and trade execution information to identify and enable punishment of illegal trading activities, including naked short selling. More than a decade after the SEC promised it, following the 2010 flash crash, CAT doesn\u2019t exist.\n* Impose real penalties on transgressors, like loss of license.\n* Send cases of serial trading cheats to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.\n* End the revolving door with Wall Street.\n* What will Gary Gensler do? And will he listen most to the pushback from the big brokers or investors like people on Superstonk?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gary Gensler- Current SEC Chair](https://preview.redd.it/8x1el37566171.jpg?width=988&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=296865c7cefe2fbb38b2ce25f4e6730bb498fa2a)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Questions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwox8t4896171.jpg?width=998&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01378e780fc8c6f174a6c840b76132b2b9e33c1e\n\n* You mentioned in your last interview that NSS has been going on for a very long time, but that it ends with Gamestop. Can you clarify further *how* you see this ending with Gamestop?\n\n\\>LK: I meant the story I tell in the book I am writing ends with GameStop. NSS goes on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8tcjb0m96171.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=051d06480a45392f1cf48bd7579fc85a6f609447\n\n* Understanding that this is an unprecedented situation, we would simply like your personal opinion: Do you think that Wall Street/ US Gov't could/would pull some \"trickery\" to prevent the short squeeze from happening? What rules are they unable, or unwilling to break?\n\n\\>LK: We saw in GameStop trickery using dark pool trades of single shares. We know -- even the SEC admits -- that brokers create fake options conversions shares. They will break every rule, helped by the SEC which chooses not to enforce or orders mild penalties.\n\n[now i want to play stardew valley](https://preview.redd.it/6prc9two96171.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5901203d74c13d3f0177dc484a6838a6b62a12e6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is your recommendation for finding a trustworthy, easily digestible news source for those of us who \"don't have the time\" to watch full hearings or read full bills?\n\n\\>LK: Depends on the subject. An aggregator I like is Naked Capitalism which has a lot of economic stories. The Daily Poster of David Sirota. I think the American Prospect that ran my NSS story is good. You have to try various online media to find the ones that do what your asking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/iosfnjcv96171.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc409dc5f02241f1aa8d009096fcb65758e029a9)\n\n*For clarification- The Hearings will be held: by U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on May 26, and by the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services on May 27.*\n\n* Congress has 2 hearings scheduled this week that are bringing megabank execs up to testify. In your opinion, will the correct questions be asked, or do you believe this is just political theatre?\n\n\\>LK: It's political theater. This is the same congress that has not reinstated the Glass -Steagall act of 1933 that separated commercial and investment banking, meaning keeping depositors' money from being used for banks own investments. thanks to Bill Clinton and Robert Rubin, the friends of Wall Street. You can tie the 2008 crash to that.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Thank y'all again for being so awesome through technical difficulties!!
