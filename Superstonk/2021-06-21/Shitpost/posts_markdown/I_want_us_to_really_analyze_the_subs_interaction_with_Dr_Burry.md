We’ve said for a while that Burry is not someone we should just trust. What Burry has effectively done is given us a “final boss”, who would be Kenny in this case, to shift all of the blame and attention.

The sub is constantly filled with Kenny memes, DD is always about Citadel and what this Kenny guy is doing. **Outside of that meme Apes need to realize this is not just Kenny; it’s your banks, brokers, regulators, and government**. 

I will not sell once I hear the hedgers are bankrupt, or that Kenny has taken the fall, because that is truly only the beginning in uncovering the fraud and crime plaguing OUR market. 

The market wouldn’t exist without us apes, and it’s our fucking market to be had.

EDIT: Damn this getting downvoted fast
