<p>We’ve said for a while that Burry is not someone we should just trust. What Burry has effectively done is given us a “final boss”, who would be Kenny in this case, to shift all of the blame and attention.</p>
<p>The sub is constantly filled with Kenny memes, DD is always about Citadel and what this Kenny guy is doing. <strong>Outside of that meme Apes need to realize this is not just Kenny; it’s your banks, brokers, regulators, and government</strong>. </p>
<p>I will not sell once I hear the hedgers are bankrupt, or that Kenny has taken the fall, because that is truly only the beginning in uncovering the fraud and crime plaguing OUR market. </p>
<p>The market wouldn’t exist without us apes, and it’s our fucking market to be had.</p>
<p>EDIT: Damn this getting downvoted fast</p>
