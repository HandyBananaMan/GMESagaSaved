<p>Hello Great Apes of the world! 👋 Last week was one of sideways action on GME, but apes resisted boredom, bought the dip, and held strong. Prepare your Diamantenhände as the German market leads us into a new week (SR-NSCC-2021-002 and Russell 1000 here we come!), and join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange as we prepare for the US pre-market to open!</p>
<h3>🚀 Buckle Up! 🚀</h3>

<p>FAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie and converting to USD. Today's EUR -&gt; USD conversion ratio is 1.18643525. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.</p>
<p>Many among the Diamantenhände community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received any response or seen any activity from him in nearly a month. I continue to reach out to DerGurkenraspler, but at this point I have no idea if or when he intends to resume updates. I will continue to serve as guest-host of the series in the meantime, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and is able to return to us soon.</p>
<p>Diamantenhände isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!</p>
