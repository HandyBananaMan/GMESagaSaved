<p>As the title says, this one goes out once again to all the shills in the rafters.</p>
<p>Any non-disclosure agreement is null and void if it is used to cover up illegal activity (such as active market manipulation).</p>
<p>The SEC is offering quite handsome rewards for whistleblowers.</p>
<p>Under the SEC Whistleblower Program, the SEC is required to pay awards to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the SEC with original information that leads to a successful enforcement action resulting in monetary sanctions in excess of $1 million.</p>
<p>So why get paid pennies on the $ for browsing reddit spreading FUD, when you could just be browsing reddit, but in your very own mansion?</p>
