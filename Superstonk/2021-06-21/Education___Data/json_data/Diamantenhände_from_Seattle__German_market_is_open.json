    "selftext": "Hello Great Apes of the world! \ud83d\udc4b Last week was one of sideways action on GME, but apes resisted boredom, bought the dip, and held strong. Prepare your Diamantenh\u00e4nde as the German market leads us into a new week (SR-NSCC-2021-002 and Russell 1000 here we come!), and join apes around the world to watch low-frequency updates from a single German exchange as we prepare for the US pre-market to open!\n\n###\ud83d\ude80 Buckle Up! \ud83d\ude80###\n\n\n\n\n\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 120 minutes in: **$215.34 / 181,50 \u20ac**\r\n- \u2b1c 115 minutes in: $215.55 / 181,68 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 110 minutes in: $215.55 / 181,68 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 105 minutes in: $215.55 / 181,68 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 100 minutes in: $215.55 / 181,68 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 95 minutes in: $215.10 / 181,30 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 90 minutes in: $215.34 / 181,50 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 85 minutes in: $215.07 / 181,27 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 80 minutes in: $215.07 / 181,27 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 75 minutes in: $215.07 / 181,27 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 70 minutes in: $215.01 / 181,23 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 65 minutes in: $215.01 / 181,23 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 60 minutes in: $214.95 / 181,18 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 55 minutes in: $214.95 / 181,18 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 50 minutes in: $214.95 / 181,18 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 45 minutes in: $214.74 / 181,00 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 40 minutes in: $214.74 / 181,00 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 35 minutes in: $214.74 / 181,00 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 30 minutes in: $214.74 / 181,00 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 25 minutes in: $214.74 / 181,00 \u20ac\r\n- \u2b1c 20 minutes in: $214.72 / 180,98 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 15 minutes in: $214.72 / 180,98 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 10 minutes in: $214.77 / 181,02 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 5 minutes in: $214.74 / 181,00 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe9 0 minutes in: $213.88 / 180,27 \u20ac\r\n- \ud83d\udfe5 US close price: $213.82 / 180,22 \u20ac   *($213.85 / 180,25 \u20ac after-hours)*\r\n\n\n\nFAQ: To generate this data, I'm capturing current prices in Euros at https://www.ls-tc.de/de/aktie/gamestop-aktie and converting to USD. Today's EUR -> USD conversion ratio is 1.18643525. I created a simple C# application that assists me in scraping this data and updates the post automatically.\n\nMany among the Diamantenh\u00e4nde community are concerned about the well-being of the originator of the series, u/DerGurkenraspler. I also am worried, as I have tried to make contact many times and haven't received any response or seen any activity from him in nearly a month. I continue to reach out to DerGurkenraspler, but at this point I have no idea if or when he intends to resume updates. I will continue to serve as guest-host of the series in the meantime, but dearly hope that DerGurkenraspler is well and is able to return to us soon.\n\nDiamantenh\u00e4nde isn't just a thread on Superstonk, it's a community that gathers daily to represent the many corners of this world who love this stock. We all love seeing the energy that people represent their varied homelands. Show your flags, share some culture, and unite around GME!",
