I use the MarketWatch GME page to view premarket, and I saw this little article at the bottom.

So I click through trying to see what the bears are saying.

This seems alarming! Directors of GME selling of substantial holdings??? I must investigate! They conveniently leave a link to the article so I can see what they mean.

Referenced Symbols: Movie stock. Not a single mention of GameStop or GME in the entire article. 

They made a hit piece against GME by using Movie stock information. How is this not blatantly manipulating the market by presenting false information?

Can I say Ford insiders are dumping all shares, so sell Airbus? What the fuck?

BTW just to fuck with them, you can view all MarketWatch articles without a subscription by simply changing the .com to .com. before the /xyz/ works on most websites to remove the paywall.

Just another example of the media being paid off to talk shit about GME when there's no evidence to suggest that it's not a godlike investment.

Buy. HODL. Drink some water.
