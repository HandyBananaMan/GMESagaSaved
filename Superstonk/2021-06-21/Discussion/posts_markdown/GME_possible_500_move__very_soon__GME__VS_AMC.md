***UPDATED THIS POST***   


I wanted to verify and double check **Elliot Wave's guy theory** and Trading Sciences claim that we were lagging behind AMC with a similar chart. **AND YES** not only are the chart extremely similar but the **major moves and pattern are almost identical.**

*Textbook move up from the end of the cup and handle formation as demonstrated below.*

My estimate is that we are lagging behind AMC about **9-10 trading days** and we could be looking at the same kind of move (**500%  â†‘** )

If someone can give a more accurate number of days or debunk this please do, until then tits are jacked. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

[A similar 500&#37; move  â†‘  would bring GME close to 1000$ or more.](https://preview.redd.it/ntwanngp1q671.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=201fee57ffd5067a16e792303bc62afdd59b8f55)
