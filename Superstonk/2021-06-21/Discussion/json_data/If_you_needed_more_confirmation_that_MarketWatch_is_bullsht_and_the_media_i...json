Directors of GME selling of substantial holdings??? I must investigate! They conveniently leave a link to the article so I can see what they mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pdz8s0fxk671.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a1d168ba63cec4dd37db652e27e788d2db5985a\n\nReferenced Symbols: Movie stock. Not a single mention of GameStop or GME in the entire article. \n\nThey made a hit piece against GME by using Movie stock information. How is this not blatantly manipulating the market by presenting false information?\n\nCan I say Ford insiders are dumping all shares, so sell Airbus? What the fuck?\n\nBTW just to fuck with them, you can view all MarketWatch articles without a subscription by simply changing the .com to .com. before the /xyz/ works on most websites to remove the paywall.\n\nJust another example of the media being paid off to talk shit about GME when there's no evidence to suggest that it's not a godlike investment.\n\nBuy. HODL. Drink some water.",
