<p>I use the MarketWatch GME page to view premarket, and I saw this little article at the bottom.</p>

<p>So I click through trying to see what the bears are saying.</p>

<p>This seems alarming! Directors of GME selling of substantial holdings??? I must investigate! They conveniently leave a link to the article so I can see what they mean.</p>

<p>Referenced Symbols: Movie stock. Not a single mention of GameStop or GME in the entire article. </p>
<p>They made a hit piece against GME by using Movie stock information. How is this not blatantly manipulating the market by presenting false information?</p>
<p>Can I say Ford insiders are dumping all shares, so sell Airbus? What the fuck?</p>
<p>BTW just to fuck with them, you can view all MarketWatch articles without a subscription by simply changing the .com to .com. before the /xyz/ works on most websites to remove the paywall.</p>
<p>Just another example of the media being paid off to talk shit about GME when there's no evidence to suggest that it's not a godlike investment.</p>
<p>Buy. HODL. Drink some water.</p>
