<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is APPROVED as of now. It is EFFECTIVE upon listing on the NSCC website, which should happen within 2 business days, meaning Wednesday. </p>
<p>So the relevant rulling, 006- which was effective immediately upon filing- outlines the timeline of 2 business days. </p>

<h1>Meet Your New Gamestop President &amp; CEO- Matt Furlong</h1>
<p>^(Former Amazon Executive)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Matt Furlong, New CEO of Gamestop" src="https://preview.redd.it/zbm0hky0fn671.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62ce391d44e65bb573c4cc189deb8641c527c2e5" /></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And with that, George Sherman has officially retired his board position which is effective immediately. However, he will remain the CEO until Furlong assumes the position of President and CEO on July 12th. </p>
<p>In the filings, Gamestop says Sherman's departure is  “not because of a disagreement with the company on any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies or practices.” His exit package is valued at $173 Million after serving the company since 2019. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>Also worth noting- the filing states that Matt Furlong will not be compensated for his Board position. All this means is- the board position is an accompaniment to the paid corporate position of President and CEO, meaning he is compensated as a corporate employee, presumably with a salary and whatever else they negotiated with him upon hiring. In contrast, Ryan Cohen is compensated (in shares) as a Board member. This just clarifies the compensation package given to his position. It doesn't reflect whether he is paid for his work as CEO.</em> </p>

<h1>A Note from your friendly local Pink Cat ✌💖🐈🦄</h1>
<p>This is coming from Pink, but let it speak for the entire mod team. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have seen complaints from moderators of other subs concerning brigading of Superstonk related comments and content in their subs, and they have mentioned escalating the issue if the brigading continues.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Moderators of Superstonk do not condone this behavior in any capacity or context.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After seeing the concerns from other relevant subs, the Satori team is currently taking extra steps to seek out this behavior and make sure, if found, that it is terminated via a permanent ban for the user from our community. WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ON BRIGADING. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what is brigading? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Brigading on Reddit is the observance of a group of people (usually subscribers of a particular subreddit) attacking another subreddit. Brigading will usually be cited if it can be shown that this was organized and/or instigated from subreddit postings and links. " <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3dc0r3/what_does_it_mean_to_brigade_a_subreddit/">Link to TL:DR comment on relevant reddit post.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Think of Superstonk as Fight Club. What happens in Fight Club, stays in Fight Club. But the number 1 rule of Fight Club......</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>DON'T TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB</strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/04qtn6c0un671.jpg?width=712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=015f4babd94235b3b64fdc6b7ea48585d0c1803a</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We are an awesome community built on friendship and support and a common love of the stock. <strong>We comfort those who seek us, we don't seek anyone to comfort.</strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Pink is always here for comfort" src="https://preview.redd.it/k1qeiop5un671.jpg?width=340&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f02f4b7e41f2478b41de18e6f6dedaab83fb105" /></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So be chill. Stay out of other stock subs, especially the more popular ones, if all you're going to do is spam Superstonk stuff to their members. This action is a punishable offense by the top admins of reddit if proven to be true, ultimately leading in subreddit termination -and besides- we don't play like that. Let's keep it excellent, and keep it contained to our beloved jungle, Superstonk. ✌</p>
