<h1>The Exponential floor</h1>
<p>the "exponential floor" from u/jth1 it seems that we are still traveling bellow the exponential floor, and I want to thank u/jth1 for continuing to log this, this so that once a correction comes in or we have something change we can still use this graph to double check, I believe we may see a correction soon and we'll be able to create either a new graphic in which the support lines are visible, or come to a new theory/conclusion.</p>

<h1>Rc's fathersday tweet.</h1>
<p>It was fathers day yesterday, so I'd honestly say it would be one of the few times the man could post something about his dad without being bombarded with "wen moon" jokes, even if I've seen some of the theories on here which I would love to be true, I'm currently in the mindset that this is nothing more then the man showing some love for his father.</p>

<h1>The NSCC 2021 002</h1>
<p>The 002 changes having enough liquidity at the end of the month into a "intraday" thing, or in smoothbrain, you better have the money on your bank account 24/7 because if daddy checks and you aint got his money, daddy gon be mad.</p>
<p>They can start checking every day, and check it multiple times even if they so choose to, instead of just the end of the month.</p>
<p>The 002 will be filed today on 21-06-2021, but could take up to 10 business days to be implemented, meaning that even if it gets filed today they can say "yeah it's active now" but they could also let it sit there for days before activating it.</p>

<h1>Annihilationgod's data</h1>

<h1>EXCELLENT!</h1>
<p>Be friendly, help others!</p>
<p>as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.</p>
<p>This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.</p>
<p>We help each other, we care for each other.</p>
<p><strong>Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes</strong></p>
<p>this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.</p>
<p>remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.</p>
<p>There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.</p>
<p>We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!</p>
<p>Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.</p>

<p>remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.</p>
<p>If anything happens throughout the day we will be adding it here.</p>

<h1>Brigading</h1>
<p>apparently this has become an issue I've only just been made aware of, it seems some moderators of other subreddits have the feeling we are condoning brigading.</p>
<p>Brigading can be seen as a lot of things, one of which is downvote brigading (downvoting everything that you don't like as a group), another one is going in there with the intent of "stirring shit up", neither are condoned by us (the moderators of superstonk) or any sub.</p>
<p>if you want to take part in another subreddit make sure you adhere to their culture and their rules.</p>
<p>One of the communities I've seen complaining about this is r/wallstreetbets, also with statements like "the moderators condone this behaviour" (as per post of u/zjz), so Zjz let me say it here so that it's clear for both subs, we don't condone brigading.</p>
<p>I do feel that seeing posts pop up all over the boards,members of r/investing r/stocks and others have received these messages (asking to write DD on random stocks) and thereby people trying to get exposure for a certain stock, and putting "squeeze" in every DD is far from good, and I believe that unless they are a stock specific sub it's hard to circumvent this, yet it does breed the idea that there are a lot of "shills"/"Bots" out there right now, and not just in one single sub but in a lot of them.</p>
<p>However that being said I do personally believe ZJZ and other mods of r/wallstreetbets are doing their best in trying to get their subreddit back to the way it was, and I hope they succeed because it used to be a very off the cuff place and now with a lot of new participants it feels different for me (and I was just a lurker for the longest time).</p>
<p>So u/zjz or u/fannypackphantom, if you guys have any trouble with members from our sub please let us know and we'll try to help as best we can.</p>
