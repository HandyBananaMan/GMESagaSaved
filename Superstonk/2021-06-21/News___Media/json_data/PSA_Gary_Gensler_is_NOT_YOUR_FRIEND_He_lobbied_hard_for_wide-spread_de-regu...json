He worked both at Goldman Sachs as well as in the treasury department, using his time and influence to put in motion many of the de-regulations that have brought us to this precipice.\n\nIf you haven't already, do yourself a favour and watch [this documentary on the 2008 collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2IaJwkqgPk), it is well-made and shows nicely just how much of a fucking cabal this whole bunch really is.\n\n**DON'T TRUST IN THOSE FUCKERS!** \n\nIs what I'm saying.",
