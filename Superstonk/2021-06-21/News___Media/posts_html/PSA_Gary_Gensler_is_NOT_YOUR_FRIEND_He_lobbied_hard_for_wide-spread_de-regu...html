<p>As the title says, Gary Gensler isn't "tough on WallSt", he's about as WallSt as they come. He worked both at Goldman Sachs as well as in the treasury department, using his time and influence to put in motion many of the de-regulations that have brought us to this precipice.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, do yourself a favour and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2IaJwkqgPk">this documentary on the 2008 collapse</a>, it is well-made and shows nicely just how much of a fucking cabal this whole bunch really is.</p>
<p><strong>DON'T TRUST IN THOSE FUCKERS!</strong> </p>
<p>Is what I'm saying.</p>
