    "selftext": "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. \n\nRandom average people are getting [50 billion dollars](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/chase-bank-50-billion-debt-glitch/) either withdrawn or deposited into their accounts.\n \nSome are getting it only withdrawn, which would be an extra 50 billion dollars in assets to the bank, no? \n\nOthers are getting 50 billion dollars added to their account, but on hold for 70 years. Seems like a neat way to balance out the charges, while having everything tilt in the favour of the bank. \n\nI fail to see a glitch that simultaneously withdraws that amount from one account while also depositing that amount with the caveat of it being on hold for decades. This is blatant book cooking at worst, and at best is a major error in the banking system. \n\n\nApologies for formatting, I am on mobile.",
