**TL;DR**: DD breadcrumb trail on a Shitadel connection, ***possibly hinted at*** by M. Burry(?) (*sorry for the brain fart in the title, was fighting automod. Could mods change the title of this post to match the part in bold, please?*).

Hoping our wrinkles get something out of these.

\- - -

I noticed something today after Dr. Burry deleted his twitter (again). Barbara Streisand effect, so into The Burry Archive I go...

![A pretty clear drop.](https://preview.redd.it/4drj76iswm671.jpg?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce216ff38efb1d8edcfb3bb78651fe6c5892e40a)

Dr. Burry had tweeted about \[**see picture for ticker, automod kills me**\] yesterday (?)**,** which - turns out - is this company:

I didn't think about this much further, until I bumped into this, literally just now in my Reddit feed - posted around an hour ago by the time I'm writing this:

&#x200B;

![Subreddit X to the rescue](https://preview.redd.it/cvm4an3wwm671.jpg?width=1328&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cc2853d1125b30f376916df0bfb208928568e71)

If you search Reddit for the company name, you'll find a lot of posts from around 5 days to one month ago, talking about them buying up a lot of  \[BANNED-CURRENCY\] on their relevant subreddits. Seems to be their MO, apparently.

But...

Turns out they are connected to our old friend Shitadel (surprise):

![EDGAR Filing snippet from February.](https://preview.redd.it/jw9ajjkxwm671.jpg?width=884&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce3a75e43a920f15a8f6bc84c075e67fd9d2e572)

All this *hoarding of* \[BANNED-CURRENCY\] made me think about this tweet too...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xjajuuszwm671.jpg?width=892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1c4ad7eba27db9e64a3774af4c643c4aae051e5

The company's share price is nothing to sneeze at ($595,50 right now), and if it's been acquiring a lot of \[BANNED-CURRENCY\] as *its* assets and thus benefits from every pumping of \[BANNED-CURRENCY\] ... would that prop up Citadel by proxy or give Kenny a way to use \[BANNED-CURRENCY\] as collateral in a way that they can't directly do anymore with the new rules?

Hoping our wrinkles get something out of these - if this is old news, I haven't bumped into these yet personally, at least here.

Could our wrinkle-DDs and crypt-0-dwelling ape brethren look at these further? I literally don't know what to do with deep data DD's or what to really even look for.

**Edit:** *Holy frak automod, what more do I need to remove*?

**Edit 2:** Can't make this shit up - Massive GME dip going on right now and Dr. Burry tweets (5min ago):

![Sooo... I'm guessing yes - related to retail's interests.](https://preview.redd.it/wjoqzj7r4n671.jpg?width=915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c74e667f6d8dca2b44368bbd07bc3e3ccd0a64b2)

**Edit 3:** Ok, I need to get back to work, but I'm starting to feel this is more like a discussion now:

&#x200B;

![Comb through the filings with a keen eye, maybe? ](https://preview.redd.it/nnhi9p1k6n671.jpg?width=1469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aded704a4ad8fc9b994b55cd5e914e62654cac5)

"**TODAY**" mentioned twice - it's 06/21/21 - what's special about today? What filings and rules are relevant to today... **002**? Humm... u/rensole ? *Maybe there's something here?*

&#x200B;

Also this - coincidence?:

&#x200B;

![Wut doing, Kenny? Part Deux.](https://preview.redd.it/ui9xmz8p6n671.jpg?width=1472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b3b6690370447e2518ccd0693bd7528b03ade88)

**Edit 4:** Wow - thanks for all the awards and kind words - seriously!

Also: it seems that Dr. Burry has again deleted or hidden his twitter account - at least I can't see his posts or content anymore outside The Burry Archive. I hope that the *completely personal conjecture that I present in this post* has not compromised him in any way. In any case, if M. Burry happens to chance upon this post for some reason: so long and thanks for all the fish!
