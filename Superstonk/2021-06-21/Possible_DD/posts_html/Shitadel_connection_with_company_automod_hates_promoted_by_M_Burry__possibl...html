<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: DD breadcrumb trail on a Shitadel connection, <strong><em>possibly hinted at</em></strong> by M. Burry(?) (<em>sorry for the brain fart in the title, was fighting automod. Could mods change the title of this post to match the part in bold, please?</em>).</p>
<p>Hoping our wrinkles get something out of these.</p>

<p>I noticed something today after Dr. Burry deleted his twitter (again). Barbara Streisand effect, so into The Burry Archive I go...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Dr. Burry had tweeted about [<strong>see picture for ticker, automod kills me</strong>] yesterday (?)<strong>,</strong> which - turns out - is this company:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Reminds me of a certain old game company logo..." src="https://preview.redd.it/j8epozgtwm671.jpg?width=1664&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc1f52494843fbdea460f9764fbd6712efa1faf4" /></p>
<p>I didn't think about this much further, until I bumped into this, literally just now in my Reddit feed - posted around an hour ago by the time I'm writing this:</p>

<p>If you search Reddit for the company name, you'll find a lot of posts from around 5 days to one month ago, talking about them buying up a lot of  [BANNED-CURRENCY] on their relevant subreddits. Seems to be their MO, apparently.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Turns out they are connected to our old friend Shitadel (surprise):</p>

<p>All this <em>hoarding of</em> [BANNED-CURRENCY] made me think about this tweet too...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/xjajuuszwm671.jpg?width=892&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1c4ad7eba27db9e64a3774af4c643c4aae051e5</p>
<p>The company's share price is nothing to sneeze at ($595,50 right now), and if it's been acquiring a lot of [BANNED-CURRENCY] as <em>its</em> assets and thus benefits from every pumping of [BANNED-CURRENCY] ... would that prop up Citadel by proxy or give Kenny a way to use [BANNED-CURRENCY] as collateral in a way that they can't directly do anymore with the new rules?</p>
<p>Hoping our wrinkles get something out of these - if this is old news, I haven't bumped into these yet personally, at least here.</p>
<p>Could our wrinkle-DDs and crypt-0-dwelling ape brethren look at these further? I literally don't know what to do with deep data DD's or what to really even look for.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>Holy frak automod, what more do I need to remove</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Can't make this shit up - Massive GME dip going on right now and Dr. Burry tweets (5min ago):</p>
<p><img alt="Sooo... I'm guessing yes - related to retail's interests." src="https://preview.redd.it/wjoqzj7r4n671.jpg?width=915&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c74e667f6d8dca2b44368bbd07bc3e3ccd0a64b2" /></p>
<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Ok, I need to get back to work, but I'm starting to feel this is more like a discussion now:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Comb through the filings with a keen eye, maybe? " src="https://preview.redd.it/nnhi9p1k6n671.jpg?width=1469&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aded704a4ad8fc9b994b55cd5e914e62654cac5" /></p>
<p>"<strong>TODAY</strong>" mentioned twice - it's 06/21/21 - what's special about today? What filings and rules are relevant to today... <strong>002</strong>? Humm... u/rensole ? <em>Maybe there's something here?</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also this - coincidence?:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><img alt="Wut doing, Kenny? Part Deux." src="https://preview.redd.it/ui9xmz8p6n671.jpg?width=1472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b3b6690370447e2518ccd0693bd7528b03ade88" /></p>
<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Wow - thanks for all the awards and kind words - seriously!</p>
<p>Also: it seems that Dr. Burry has again deleted or hidden his twitter account - at least I can't see his posts or content anymore outside The Burry Archive. I hope that the <em>completely personal conjecture that I present in this post</em> has not compromised him in any way. In any case, if M. Burry happens to chance upon this post for some reason: so long and thanks for all the fish!</p>
