While I wait for the data to be released by the Fed, which is suppose to be released on Tuesdays.

Q&A (3): [https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/nominal-yield-curve.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/nominal-yield-curve.htm)

But, it's the government, so it is all 'typically' late - i.e. whenever they decide to get to it.

&#x200B;

And, I found something fucking mindblowing!

&#x200B;

TLDR; Fed is complicit in FTDs, and even covered it up by removing it's data from the equation curve fit instead of doing anything about it. The price is wrong!

&#x200B;

Last week I've released a DD into the massive equation that governs Fed's Nominal Yield curve.

**Blue -** RRP Values

**Red** \- Fed Interest Rate (%)

**Yellow** \- 10Y Treasury Bond Yield (%)

**Green** \- TAU1 (\[DATA\] - [TAU1 on the nominal Yield Curve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/nominal-yield-curve.htm))

**Purple** \- [CPI](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm)

There is a lot of word spaghetti - but the message was simple (with some exceptions related to CPI):

**TAU1 is inversely correlated to the RRP values as seen during multiple periods of RRP existence.**

&#x200B;

While waiting for the data, I decided to read the document of the nominal yield curve again.

![The U.S. Treasury Yield Curve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/200628/200628pap.pdf)

&#x200B;

The only definition of TAU1 was described as follows (page 13):

>In between, forward rates can have a “hump,” with  the  magnitude  and  sign  of  the  hump  determined  by  the  parameter β2  and  the  location of the hump determined by the parameter TAU1.

I got to the Section 4 : Data and Estimation Issues, which point to some assumptions / data removal as follows (removed some stuff) and it gets interesting:

1. We  exclude  all  securities  with  option-like  features,  including  callable  bonds  and flower bonds.
2. We  exclude  all  securities  with  less  than  three  months  to  maturity,  since  the  yields  on  these  securities  often  seem  to  behave  oddly.
3. We also exclude all Treasury bills out of concern about segmented markets. ... Duffee  (1996)  showed  that  bill  rates  are  often  disconnected  from  the  rest  of  the  Treasury yield curve, perhaps **owing to segmented demand from money market funds and other short-term investors.**
   1. O.K. Holy crap! The Fed, themselves, admit that the shorts are actually able to manipulate the treasury market. Smells like "Everything Short" to anyone?
4. We  begin  to  exclude  twenty-year  bonds  in  1996,  because  those  securities  often   appeared   cheap   relative   to   ten-year   notes   with   comparable   duration.
5. We  exclude  the  two  most  recently  issued  securities  with  maturities  of  two,  three, four, five, seven, ten, twenty, and thirty years for securities issued in 1980 or later. These are the “on-the-run” and “first off-the-run” issues that often trade at a premium to other Treasury securities, **owing to their greater liquidity and their frequent specialness in the repo market**.
   1. This is the first mention of the repo market and how it affects the yield curve estimation.
6. Other issues that we judgmentally exclude on an *ad hoc* basis. **For example, there were large and persistent fails-to-deliver in the May 2013 3⅝ percent ten-year note, well after it ceased to be either the on-the-run or first off-the-run ten-year security.  With the  security  persistently  trading  around  the  fails  rate  in  the  overnight  repo  market,  the  yield on the security in the cash market was driven down.  Thus, we dropped the security for some time to avoid having our yield curve distorted by the idiosyncratic dislocation of this issue.**
   1. OK, so the Fed knows the mechanism, and even admits to the fact that Fails to Deliver of the Treasury Bond - causing the Fed to completely remove the 3 5/8% 10Y note in 2013 because they know what fuckery it supported
   2. The Fed is admitting that these FTDs are actually being traded in the OVERNIGHT REPO MARKET, driving down the yield of the security.
   3. Fed knew this - and instead of fucking doing something, just removed it from the calculation.

&#x200B;

So, while I wait for the fudged Fed Data - I've discovered that even the Fed, admitting themselves, are complicit in the whole FTD.

Ya'll should be gathering your pitchforks, as today's meeting in the White House was likely not to protect the Retail.

Edit 1: Added sentence to TLDR.
