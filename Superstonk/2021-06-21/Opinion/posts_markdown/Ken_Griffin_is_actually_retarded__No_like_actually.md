His move is to supress the price into the range we were buying? To make scary looking dips so we sell? Like what the fuck. Im a psychology Bachelors drop out and even i know enough to say this plan is flawed as absolute fuck. 

Like bro i didnt sell at 344. I buy when i see 1xx. 
I didnt sell when it went 344 to 240. Why would i sell for 220 to 200? Like at this point hes actually retarded.
I plan to start thinking about selling when i see commas or a stock split. Why would I go "ok fuck it im gonnna sell at the bottom of this dip" when im holding out for litteraly thousands a share to even wake me up. 

Hands down no exaggeration ken Griffin grew up on lead water or something. Im litteraly baffled such a huge idiot has so much money.
